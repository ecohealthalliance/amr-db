# We may be able to just unite and geocode (see below), instead of the for loop, but we would not explicitely retain the hierarchy info.
# Not sure that we need the hierarchical info for the database itself (just for vis) so that may be fine
# I will explore this more before next meeting

  #unite(col = geocode_compare, hospital, city, state_province_district, country, remove = FALSE, sep = " ") 

# Stil need to to incorporate the few lines that clean travel locations and geocode those
