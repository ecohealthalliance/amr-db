Data on the four core ontologies underlying the CARD are provided in three formats: OBO, 
CSV, and JSON. The Antibiotic Resistance Ontology is additional available in OWL format.
The ontologies are:

ARO - The Antibiotic Resistance Ontology that serves as the primary organizing principle 
of the CARD.

MO - CARD's Model Ontology which describes the different antimicrobial resistance gene 
detection models encoded in the CARD and used by the Resistance Gene Identifier.

NCBITaxon - A slim version of the NCBI Taxonomy used by the CARD to track source pathogen
of molecular sequences.

RO - CARD's Relationship Ontology which describes the different relationship types between 
ontology terms.
