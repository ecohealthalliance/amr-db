1959,yes,berktold2012,article,"BACKGROUND: Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (caMRSA) is an emerging pathogen which causes potentially severe infections in young and healthy individuals due to the ability of most strains to produce Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL). The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of PVL-positive (PVL(+))-MRSA strains in Western Austria in the period from December 2005 to May 2010 and to characterize the identified PVL(+)-MRSA strains. METHODS: Six hundred and fifty MRSA strains from Innsbruck Medical University hospital, district hospitals, and general practitioners were investigated for the presence of lukS-lukF gene (encoding for PVL). Antimicrobial resistance testing, SCCmec-, agr-, MLST- and spa-typing, as well as arcA determination were performed on PVL(+)-MRSA. RESULTS: Among 650 MRSA strains collected from various body sites from hospitalized patients and outpatients, 31 strains (4.8 {\%}) were positive for lukS-lukF and thus identified as PVL(+)-MRSA. Agr-1 was the most common agr-type (n = 18, 58.1 {\%}) and SCCmec-IV or variants IVa and IVc were the most common SCCmec types (n = 27, 87.1 {\%}). All tested strains showed in-vitro susceptibility to vancomycin and rifampicin, but resistance against cotrimoxazol (6.4 {\%}), clindamycin (9.7 {\%}), gentamicin (9.7 {\%}), fusidic acid (12.9 {\%}), levofloxacin (12.9 {\%}), and erythromycin (61.3 {\%}) was found. Most lukS-lukF-positive MRSA detected in our survey shared ST8 and t008 and were positive for arcA. CONCLUSIONS: The major lukS-lukF-positive MRSA lineage found in our population was ST8, t008 and positive for arcA which is mainly found in the USA.

9069,yes,huang2016a,article,"Introduction: Klebsiella pneumoniae belongs to the ESKAPE group and is one of the top five pathogens causing nosocomial infections worldwide. The widespread emergence of multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae is a major public health concerns. $\beta$-lactams are the antibiotics most widely used all over the world, have also given rise to a continuous increase of resistance and driven diversification of the resistance and driven diversification of the resistance mechanisms.Various $\beta$-lactamases have been identified to hydrolyze $\beta$-lactams. The extended-spectrum $\beta$-lactamases, such as CTX-M and SHV, hydrolyze cephalosporins and monobactams; whereas K. pneumoniae carbapenemases (KPCs) confer carbapenem resistance. Many $\beta$-lactamase genes reside in plasmids, transferring between different stains or species. Methods: Routine clinical MicroScan and Etest methods were used to profile the susceptibility of antimicrobial resistance in K. pneumoniae clinical isolates recovered from patient specimens during 2005-2014. Additional PCR amplification followed by Sanger sequencing was used for gene detection of blaCTX-M and blaKPC. A combination of short- and long-read whole genome sequencing was used for three isolates positive to both blaCTXM and blaKPC. Comparative genomic analyses were further conducted to characterize detailed resistance gene structures and genomic features. Results: We identified three K. pneumoniae isolates, CN1, CR14 and NY9, carrying both blaCTXM and blaKPC. Through de novo assembly, we obtained three complete genomes. In CR14 and NY9, blaCTX-M and blaKPC were carried in distinctive plasmids with distinctive incompatibility. In contrast, CN1 harbors in chromosome one blaKPC-2 and three blaCTX-M-15 genes, in addition to one blaSHV-11. Whereas blaCTX-M-15 genes were transferred via the same insertion sequence ISEcp1, blaKPC-2 gene was mobilized in the context of insertion sequence Tn4401a, which was found conjugative with a PsP3-like prophage in CN1 chromosome. Intriguingly, downstream of the newly generated Tn4401a-prophage genomic island, CN1 carried a CRISPR-Cas array with four spacers targeting a variety of K. pneumoniae plasmids carrying antimicrobial resistance genes. It suggests the evolving CRISPR-Cas, a bacterial immune system preventing phage infection and plasmid transfer, might have induced the mobilization of resistance genes from plasmids into chromosome under the selective force. Conclusion: We observed the emergence of K. pneumoniae isolates carrying multiple choromosomal $\beta$-lactamase genes. Our comparative genomic analyses revealed their shared genomic features and dynamic evolutionary events occurring in choromosome.The dissemination of $\beta$-lactam resistance from plasmids to chromosome depicts the currently complex pandemic scenario of multidrug resistant K. pneumoniae isolates.",W Huang and G Wang and R Sebra and J Zhuge and C Yin and M E Aguero-Rosenfeld and A N Schuetz and N Dimitrova and J T Fallon,1943-7811,Journal of Molecular Diagnostics,"DNA flanking region,Klebsiella pneumoniae,antibiotic resistance,beta lactamase,chromosome,clinical study,clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic,disease carrier,drug resistance,endogenous compound,epsilometer test,gene amplification,gene insertion sequence,genomic island,human,human tissue,immune system,infection,nonhuman,pandemic,plasmid,polymerase chain reaction,prevention,prophage,species,stain",981,{Emergence of multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae carrying multiple chromosomal beta-lactamase genes},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l613102131 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=19437811{\&}id=doi:{\&}atitle=emergence+of+multidrug-resistant+klebsiella+pneumoniae+carrying+multiple+chromosomal+,18,2016,6,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,maybe,brooke,yes,ayomide,ayomide,allison_1,yes,aw_1.csv,NA,NA,aw_1_1.mex,yes,journal

Methods: Five patients presented with fever and blood cultures positive for fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli after prostate needle biopsy with pre-procedure fluoroquinolone antimicrobial prophylaxis. The cases are described and the published data reviewed. Results: Of the 5 patients, 1 was treated at Hoag Memorial Hospital in 2008, 2 were treated at the Long Beach Veterans Affairs Medical Center, 1 was treated at Kaiser Permanente Hospital in 2007, and 1 presented to University of California, Irvine, Medical Center in 2006. All patients received an oral fluoroquinolone antibiotic the morning of or 1 hour before biopsy. Of the 5 patients, 4 also received gentamicin intramuscularly before biopsy. Conclusions: The estimated incidence of sepsis was 0.1{\%}-0.9{\%}, assuming patients reported to the hospital at which the biopsy was performed. From a review of the published data, we recommend a fluoroquinolone antibiotic before and after biopsy for ä_24 hours.

11591,maybe,lau2007,article,"Four bacterial isolates were recovered from the blood cultures of four patients, two of whom were from Hong Kong and two of whom were from Canada. The two Hong Kong strains were isolated from a 48-year-old man with intestinal obstruction and secondary sepsis (strain HKU16T) and from a 39-year-old man with acute appendicitis (strain HKU17), while the two Canadian strains were isolated from a 74-year-old man with biliary sepsis (strain CA1) and from a 66-year-old woman with metastatic carcinoma and sepsis (strain CA2). While the first three patients survived, the last patient died 2 weeks after the episode of bacteremia. All four isolates are strictly anaerobic, nonsporulating, gram-positive coccobacilli that were unidentified by conventional phenotypic tests and commercial identification systems. They grow on sheep blood agar as nonhemolytic pinpoint colonies after 48 h of incubation at 37ÁC in an anaerobic environment. All are catalase positive and motile, with flagella. They produce acid from arabinose, glucose, mannose, and xylose. They do not produce indole or reduce nitrate. They are sensitive to penicillin, vancomycin, and metronidazole but resistant to cefotaxime. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed 16.0{\%}, 16.8{\%}, and 21.0{\%} base differences from Clostridium propionicum, Clostridium neopropionicum, and Atopobium minutum, respectively. The G+C content of strain HKU16T is 40.2{\%} ± 2.2{\%}. Based on their phylogenetic affiliation, unique G+C content, and phenotypic characteristics, we propose a new genus and species, Catabacter hongkongensis gen. nov., sp. nov., to describe the bacterium, for which HKU16 is the type strain, and suggest that it be assigned to a new family, Catabacteriaceae. The gastrointestinal tract was probably the source of the bacterium for at least three of the four patients. The isolation of a catalase-positive, motile, nonsporulating, anaerobic gram-positive bacillus in clinical laboratories should raise the possibility of C. hongkongensis.

The case-fatality rate in children with Enterococcus faecalis septicaemia (28.6{\%}, 4/14) was not significantly different from those with Enterococcus faecium septicaemia (6.7{\%}, 1/15, p = 0.12). E. faecium isolates commonly had combined ampicillin-resistance and high-level gentamicin resistance (HLGR), (9/17), while E. faecalis frequently displayed HLGR (6/15), but were ampicillin susceptible. None of the tested enterococcal isolates displayed vancomycin resistance by Etest or PCR for vanA and vanB genes. Multi-locus sequence-typing (MLST) showed that the majority of E. faecium (7/12) belonged to the hospital associated Bayesian Analysis of Population Structure (BAPS) group 3-3. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) indicated close genetic relationship particularly among E. faecium isolates, but also among E. faecalis isolates. There was also correlation between BAPS group and PFGE results. Risk factors for enterococcal bloodstream infection in univariate analysis were hospital-acquired infection and clinical diagnosis of sepsis with unknown focus. In multivariate analysis, neonates in general were relatively protected from enterococcal infection, while both prematurity and clinical sepsis were risk factors. Malnutrition was a risk factor for enterococcal bloodstream infection among HIV negative children. Conclusion: This is the first study to describe bloodstream infections caused by ampicillin-resistant HLGR E. faecium and HLGR E. faecalis in Tanzania. The isolates of E. faecium and E. faecalis, respectively, showed high degrees of relatedness by genotyping using PFGE. The commonly used treatment regimens at the hospital are insufficient for infections caused by these microbes.

Community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) has been associated with virulent strains producing Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) and a variety of other exotoxins. In Geneva, PVL-producing CA-MRSA was first reported in 2002 and a surveillance system based on voluntary reporting was set up. Each MRSA-positive culture result with an antibiotic resistance profile different from the endemic strain prevailing in the Geneva healthcare setting diagnosed in a patient without a history of hospital admission in the previous 12 months was notified to the local health department. A questionnaire was completed by the attending physician with demographic, clinical and exposure information. From January 2002 until December 2004, data on 58 cases were reported, including 26 cases grouped in 13 distinct transmission clusters. Most were family related and for two of them, colonisation persisted over a 12 month period despite treatment. Thirty three patients (57{\%}) were male. Median age was 32 years, 22{\%} being younger than 10 years. Forty one cases (71{\%}) were infected and 17 (29{\%}) colonised. Symptomatic skin lesions such as furunculosis, impetigo or abscess were present in 40 (97{\%}) of the 41 infected cases. Most cases had no underlying disease. Thirty eight cases (65{\%}) had travelled abroad. Forty (69{\%}) of 58 isolates carried the PVL toxin. CA-MRSA infections in Geneva appear to be an emerging problem in the canton. Surveillance should continue and should possibly be extended to other parts of the country to better describe transmission patterns and the spread of this pathogen.

Reasons for this include the prolonged survival of severely ill and immunocompromised patients, the development of more invasive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and the sub-optimal use of antibiotics that disrupts normal microbial balance and favors superinfections. Case Report: We present a rare case of sepsis due to multidrug-resistant Corynebacterium striatum in a 76-year-old host. The patient suffered from myelodysplastic syndrome and was on corticosteroid treatment due to atopic dermatitis. He had, also, a recent hospital admission and received a course of broad-spectrum antibiotics due to lower respiratory infection.

The patient had been transferred from another hospital of a neighbouring country after 5 days of hospitalization due to a car accident. The clinical history mentioned antibiotic treatment not including carbapenems (gentamicine, metronidazole and ceftriaxone), and no link to India or Pakistan. We investigated the carbapenem resistance mechanism. Materials and Methods: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by both Vitek2 and microdiluition, and interpreted according to the latest EUCAST documents. The presence of a carbapenemase was investigated by means of an MBL-etest, hydrolysis of carbapenems and EDTA inhibition of hydrolysis. PCR and sequencing were carried out by standard procedures. Resistance was transferred by conjugation to E. coli J53. Results: The strain was resistant to imipenem and meropenem (MICs 16 mg/L and 64 mg/L, respectively), and to all 3G-cephalosporins (MICs{\textgreater}128 mg/L), and susceptible to ciprofloxacin (MIC 0.25 mg/L) It also harboured a qnrA and a ctx-m-15 genes. The presence of an MBL was suggested by the MBL Etest and confirmed spectrophotometric by EDTA-inhibited imipenem hydrolysis. PCR performed by using primers specific for blaIMP, blaVIM, blaSPM, blaGIM, and blaSIM, did not yield any product. A product obtained with NDM primers was confirmed, after sequencing, to code for an NDM-1 enzyme. The resistance to carbapenems and 3G-cephalosporins was transferred to E. coli J53 by conjugation. Conclusions: To our knowledge this is the first report of an NDM-1- producing K. pneumoniae in Croatia and in the Balkans. The patient had no apparent link to the Indian subcontinent and the strain was isolated before the recent outbreak of NDM-1 producing Enterobacteriaceae.

1151,maybe,aubry2014,article,"Background: Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the major public health problems in Congo. However, data concerning Mycobacterium tuberculosis drug resistance are lacking because of the insufficient processing capacity. So, the aim of this study was to investigate for the first time the resistance patterns and the strain lineages of a sample of M. tuberculosis complex (MTBC) isolates collected in the two main cities of Congo. Methods: Over a 9-day period, 114 smear-positive sputa isolated from 114 patients attending centers for the diagnosis and treatment of TB in Brazzaville and Pointe Noire were collected for culture and drug susceptibility testing (DST). Detection of mutations conferring drug resistance was performed by using line probe assays (GenoType MTBDRplus and MTBDRsl) and DNA sequencing. Strain lineages were determined by MIRU-VNTR genotyping. Results: Of the 114 sputa, 46 were culture positive for MTBC. Twenty-one (46{\%}) were resistant to one or more first-line antiTB drugs. Of these, 15 (71{\%}) were multidrug resistant (MDR). The most prevalent mutations involved in rifampin and isoniazid resistance, D516V (60{\%}) in rpoB and S315T (87{\%}) in katG respectively, were well detected by MTBDRplus assay. All the 15 MDR strains were susceptible to fluoroquinolone and injectable second-line drug. No mutation was detected in the rrs locus involved in resistance to amikacin and capreomycin by both the MTBDRsl assay and DNA sequencing. By contrast, 9 MDR strains belonging to the same cluster related to T-family were identified as being falsely resistant to fluoroquinolone by the MTBDRsl assay due to the presence of a double substitution T80A-A90G in GyrA. Conclusions: Taken together, these data revealed a possible spread of a particular MDR clone in Congo, misidentified as fluoroquinolone resistant by MTBDRsl assay. Thus, this test cannot replace gold-standard culture method and should be interpreted carefully in view of the patient's native land.

2418,maybe,borgia2012,article,"BACKGROUND: New Delhi metallo-ss-lactamase (NDM) has emerged worldwide in clinically relevant gram-negative bacteria. We report an outbreak of NDM-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae in patients with no prior travel history to endemic regions. METHODS: Five NDM-1-producing K. pneumoniae colonizing and/or clinically infecting patients in a community tertiary hospital were detected between October and November 2011. NDM-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae (K. pneumoniae and Escherichia coli) were clinically and epidemiologically characterized, including susceptibility profiles, molecular typing, and molecular characterization of plasmids and resistant determinants. RESULTS: Five patients were identified carrying NDM-1-producing K. pneumoniae, all of them epidemiologically linked with each other. K. pneumoniae were confirmed to belong to the same clone, exhibiting multidrug-resistant phenotypes. One patient was positive for NDM-1-producing E. coli in blood and E. coli and K. pneumoniae in rectal specimens, both containing the same bla(NDM) plasmid, suggesting horizontal transfer between species in the patient. No environmental sources of these strains were found. Detection of positive isolates directly from rectal specimens allowed the rapid identification and isolation of colonized patients. CONCLUSIONS: We report a NDM-1-producing K. pneumoniae outbreak in Ontario, Canada. Implementation of standard infection control practices, including active screening was able to contain the spread of this organism in the hospital setting. Of concern is the potential loss of a travel history to identify patients that are at high risk of being colonized or infected with this organism and the lack of an accurate, cost-effective test that can be implemented in the hospital setting to identify these multidrug-resistant organisms.",S Borgia and O Lastovetska and D Richardson and A Eshaghi and J Xiong and C Chung and M Baqi and A McGeer and G Ricci and R Sawicki and R Pantelidis and D E Low and S N Patel and R G Melano,1058-4838,Clin Infect Dis,"*Disease Outbreaks,Aged,Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology,Carbapenems/*pharmacology,Cross Infection/epidemiology/microbiology,Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial,Female,Hospitals,Humans,Klebsiella Infections/epidemiology/*microbiology,Klebsiella pneumoniae/*drug effects/enzymology,Male,Middle Aged,Ontario/epidemiology,Rectum/microbiology,beta-Lactamases/genetics/*metabolism",e109--17,"{Outbreak of carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae containing blaNDM-1, Ontario, Canada}",NA,55,2012,11,"1537-6591borgia, sergiolastovetska, olgarichardson, davideshaghi, alirezaxiong, jianhuichung, catherinebaqi, mahinmcgeer, allisonricci, gloriasawicki, rachaelpantelidis, rajnilow, donald epatel, samir nmelano, roberto gjournal articleresearch support, non-u.s. gov'tunited statesclin infect dis. 2012 dec;55(11):e109-17. doi: 10.1093/cid/cis737. epub 2012 sep 20.",10.1093/cid/cis737,9/22/12,eng,22997214,yes,cale,maybe,zach,zach,brooke_1,yes,bw_1.csv,NA,NA,bw_1_1.mex,yes,journal

3799,maybe,chisholm2009,article,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the origin of high-level azithromycin resistance that emerged in isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae in England and Wales in 2007, and to establish methods for identifying high-level azithromycin resistance. METHODS: The Gonococcal Resistance to Antimicrobials Surveillance Programme (GRASP) data from 2001-07 were examined for emerging trends in azithromycin susceptibility. Further to the identification of six high-level azithromycin-resistant isolates in GRASP 2007, an additional 102 isolates were selected on the basis of azithromycin susceptibility and geographic origin from the GRASP 2006 and 2007 collections. Susceptibility testing by Etest and disc diffusion was performed on all 108 isolates and 75 of these were typed by N. gonorrhoeae multiantigen sequence typing. RESULTS: A slight drift towards higher MICs of azithromycin was observed in the gonococcal population since 2001. Of greater concern was the first example of a shift to high-level resistance observed in six isolates in 2007. All six isolates were sequence type 649, which was not observed in any of the lower-level azithromycin-resistant isolates from 2007 or in any isolates tested from the same geographical locations. Contact tracing data for one patient suggested a link with Scotland. Disc diffusion testing of all 108 isolates showed that azithromycin, but not erythromycin, discs can differentiate between low-level and high-level resistance. CONCLUSIONS: High-level azithromycin resistance has emerged in England and Wales. Contact tracing and typing data suggest this may have originated from Scotland.

3956,yes,chung2016a,article,"Background: Mycotic anastomotic pseudoaneurysm of renal allograft artery is a rare complication of renal transplantation with less than 30 cases known to the literature. Aim: To report a rare case of mycotic pseudoaneurysm caused by multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and to review the literature for reported mycotic pseudoaneurysms regarding their causative agents and treatment modalities. Methods: We report a 42 year-old man with endstage renal failure due to diabetic nephropathy who had a renal transplant anastomosed to right external iliac artery and vein. He presented with right iliac fossa discomfort and fever 3 weeks post-operatively. CT scan showed a 3.8cmx3.5 cm pseudoaneurysm posteromedial to graft kidney. He underwent emergency graft excision and pseudoaneurysm resection with in-situ reversed long saphenous vein interposition graft. Aneurysm wall grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Subsequently he made good recovery on multiple antibiotics and haemodialysis. Literature search was conducted via Pubmed database using the keywords mycotic pseudoaneurysm, renal artery and renal transplant. Exclusion criteria include non-mycotic pseudoaneurysms and pseudoaneurysms occurring outside the anastomosis between renal allograft artery and external iliac artery. Results: 28 cases of mycotic pseudoaneurysms were selected for review. Most require graft nephrectomy with only one successful case of conservative treatment. 82.1{\%} yielded fungus in the resected specimen.

4578,maybe,dalal2015,article,"Background: While the high burden of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) itself is a matter of great concern, the emergence and rise of advanced forms of drug-resistance such as extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) and extremely drug-resistant TB (XXDR-TB) is more troubling. The aim of this study was to investigate the trends over time of patterns of drug resistance in a sample of MDR-TB patients in greater metropolitan Mumbai, India. Methods: This was a retrospective, observational study of drug susceptibility testing (DST) results among MDR-TB patients from eight health care facilities in greater Mumbai between 2005 and 2013. We classified resistance patterns into four categories: MDR-TB, pre-XDR-TB, XDR-TB and XXDR-TB. Results: A total of 340 MDR-TB patients were included in the study. Pre-XDR-TB was the most common form of drug-resistant TB observed overall in this Mumbai population at 56.8{\%} compared to 29.4{\%}for MDR-TB. The proportion of patients with MDR-TB was 39.4{\%} in the period 2005-2007 and 27.8{\%} in 2011-2013, while the proportion of those with XDR-TB and XXDR-TB was changed from 6.1{\%} and 0{\%} respectively to 10.6{\%} and 5.6{\%} during the same time period. During the same periods, the proportions of patients with ofloxacin, moxifloxacin and ethionamide resistance significantly increased from 57.6{\%}to 75.3{\%}, from 60.0{\%} to 69.5{\%} and from 24.2{\%} to 52.5{\%}respectively (p{\textless}0.05). Discussion: The observed trends in TB drug-resistance patterns in Mumbai highlight the need for individualized drug regimens, designed on the basis of DST results involving first- and second-line anti-TB drugs and treatment history of the patient. A drug-resistant TB case-finding strategy based on molecular techniques that identify only rifampicin resistance will lead to initiation of suboptimal treatment regimens for a significant number of patients, which may in turn contribute to amplification of resistance and transmission of strains with increasingly advanced resistance within the community.",A Dalal and A Pawaskar and M Das and R Desai and P Prabhudesai and P Chhajed and S Rajan and D Reddy and S Babu and T K Jayalakshmi and P Saranchuk and C Rodrigues and P Isaakidis,1932-6203,PLoS ONE,",Adolescent,Adult,Aged,Antitubercular Agents/*pharmacology,Bacterial,Child,Drug Resistance,Ethionamide/pharmacology,Female,Fluoroquinolones/pharmacology,Humans,India,India/epidemiology,Infant,Male,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Middle Aged,Multidrug-Resistant/classification/*,Multiple,Mycobacterium tuberculosis,Mycobacterium tuberculosis/*drug effects/*isolatio,Ofloxacin/pharmacology,Precision Medicine,Preschool,Retrospective Studies,Tuberculosis,Young Adult,adolescent,adult,amikacin,aminosalicylic acid,antibiotic resistance,antibiotic sensitivity,article,capreomycin,child,clofazimine,ethionamide,extensively drug resistant tuberculosis,female,human,infant,isoniazid,kanamycin,levofloxacin,linezolid,major clinical study,male,moxifloxacin,multidrug resistant tuberculosis,nonhuman,observational study,ofloxacin,retrospective study,rifampicin,streptomycin,trend study",e0116798,{Resistance patterns among multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patients in greater metropolitan Mumbai: trends over time},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l601683548 http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0116798 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=19326203{\&}id=doi:10.1371{\%}2fjournal.pone.0116798{\&}atitle=resistan,10,2015,1,"from duplicate 2 (resistance patterns among multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patients in greater metropolitan mumbai: trends over time - dalal, a; pawaskar, a; das, m; desai, r; prabhudesai, p; chhajed, p; rajan, s; reddy, d; babu, s; jayalakshmi, t k; saranchuk, p; rodrigues, c; isaakidis, p)1932-6203dalal, alpapawaskar, akshaydas, mrinalinidesai, ranjanprabhudesai, pralhadchhajed, prashantrajan, sujeetreddy, deepeshbabu, sajitjayalakshmi, t ksaranchuk, peterrodrigues, camillaisaakidis, petrosjournal articleobservational studyunited statesplos one. 2015 jan 21;10(1):e0116798. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0116798. ecollection 2015.",10.1371/journal.pone.0116798,1/22/15,eng,25606853,yes,allison,maybe,brooke,brooke,brooke_1,yes,bw_1.csv,NA,NA,bw_1_1.mex,yes,journal

Sample size was calculated according to the population and WHO's estimated incidence of smear positive tuberculosis in the province/country. Sputum samples were obtained from 122 newly diagnosed patients of pulmonary tuberculosis from centres in Peshawar and Abbotabad in NWFP. RESULTS: Sensitivities were performed by proportion method which showed the following resistance values in 118 eligible patients: 15 (12.7{\%}) samples showed primary resistance to one or more drugs. 8 (6.4{\%}) isolates were resistant to a single drug, 2 (1.6{\%}) were resistant to 2 drugs, 4 (3.2{\%}) to 3 drugs, 1 (0.8{\%}) to 4 drugs while none to all 5 first line agents.

Within this diverse group, VIM-producing Enterobacter cloacae is increasingly reported in countries such as Greece and Spain. In this report, we evaluate the evidence for transmission of carbapenem-resistant E. cloacae in a cardiothoracic intensive care unit (CT-ICU). Methods: Clinical, infection control and microbiological data were collated. Clinical specimens were cultured by rountine methods. Patients (rectal swab) and the environment were screened for CRE. Isolates were identified by Vitek 2 and susceptibility testing was performed by CLSI disc diffusion. Evaluation for carbapenemase was conducted using the modified Hodge test (MHT), metallo-$\beta$-lactamase (MBL) Etest and synergy testing. PCR detection of carbapenemase genes and analysis of Xba1-restricted PFGE banding patterns were also performed. Results: Carbapenem-resistant E. cloacae were cultured from sternal wounds of 2 patients within a 6-day period. Both patients had received broad-spectrum antibiotics but neither had a history of recent travel. Their respective stays in the CT-ICU had overlapped for 11 days. Both were treated with appropriate antibiotics while aggressive infection control measures were instituted. CRE was not isolated from other patients, the hospital environment or medical equipment at that time. The isolates were resistant to $\beta$-lactams (including carbapenems), gentamicin and tobramycin, but susceptible to ciprofloxacin, amikacin and colistin. Phenotypic carbapenemase screening methods yielded positive but often inconsistent and subtle results. PCR confirmed the presence of blaVIM in both isolates, while PFGE demonstrated indistinguishable banding patterns. Conclusions: This is the first report of the emergence of VIM-producing E. cloacae in Ireland. Sternal wound infections by such organisms were also not previously reported. Clinical and molecular data indicated that cross-transmission of carbapenem-resistant E. cloacae in CT-ICU was likely. Laboratory detection of VIM-producing Enterobacteriaceae remains challenging, while the need for active surveillance in highrisk patients warrants further consideration.

Rectal swab samples were taken once in a month from a total of 180 patients who were hospitalized in the Surgery and Intensive Care Units, adult Oncology-Hematology and Pediatric Oncology Units between March-December 2006. The samples were cultivated onto bile-esculine agar media, and Miniapi system (bioMerieux, France) was used for the identification at species-level (Rapid ID 32 Strep kit, bioMerieux, France) and for the detection of antimicrobial susceptibilities (ATB Enterococcus kit, bioMerieux, France). MIC levels have been determined by the use of vancomycin E-test (AB Biodisk, Sweden) strips in brain-heart infusion agar (Merck, France). According to the culture results, 126 of the patients (70{\%}) have been found to be colonized with Enterococcus spp. The most frequently isolated species were as follows respectively; E. faecium (42{\%}), E. faecalis (31{\%}), E. avium (12{\%}), E. gallinarum (8{\%}) and E. casseliflavus, (5.6{\%}). Four of the E. faecium strains (3.2{\%}) were found resistant to vancomycin by both automated antibiotic susceptibility test system and E-test (MIC {\textgreater}256 mg/ml). Vancomycin-resistant strains have been identified as being VanA genotypes by polymerase chain reaction.

The isolate was identified using biochemical tests and PhoenixÜ¢ automated system and was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS). MICs of each antibiotic were determined by Etest. Screening for carbapenemase production was performed by the modified Hodge test and was confirmed by PCR amplification. Virulence factors were also studied. Plasmid replicon typing was used to classify Incompatibility (Inc) plasmids harbouring the resistance genes. The transferability of each plasmid was determined by conjugation using Escherichia coli J53. Finally, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was performed to determine the ST of the strain. The bacterial isolate was identified as K. pneumoniae and was named KPM2, carrying entB, ybtS, mrkD and ycfM virulence genes, but it did not overexpress OqxAB. Isolate KPM2 belonged to ST147 and was classified as resistant to all of the tested antibiotics with MICs above the clinical breakpoints. These resistances were due to production of OXA-48, CMY-2, TEM-1, CTX-M-15 and VEB-8 $\beta$-lactamases. Genetic and molecular studies showed that blaOXA-48 was embedded in transposon Tn1999.2 and was carried by a conjugative IncL/M plasmid of ca. 60 kb; blaVEB-8 was harboured on a conjugative IncA/C plasmid of ca. 120 kb.

Emergence of linezolid resistant clinical strains is a serious issue in the healthcare settings worldwide. We report here the molecular characterization of a linezolid resistant clinical isolate of Staphylococcus haemolyticus from India. Methods: The species of the clinical isolate was identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of linezolid, clindamycin, chloramphenicol and oxacillin were determined by E-test method. To elucidate the mechanism of linezolid-resistance, presence of cfr gene (chloramphenicol forfenicol resistance) and mutations in 23S rRNA and ribosomal proteins (L3, L4 and L22) were investigated. Staphylococcal Cassette Chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing was performed by multiplex PCR. Results: The study documented a rare clinical S. haemolyticus strain with three independent mechanisms of linezolid-resistance. The strain carried cfr gene, the only known transmissible mechanism of linezolid-resistance. The strain also possessed resistance-conferring mutations such as G2576T in domain V of 23S rRNA gene and Met156Thr in L3 ribosomal protein. The other ribosomal proteins (L4 and L22) did not exhibit mutations accountable for linezolid-resistance. Restriction digestion by NheI revealed that all the alleles of 23S rRNA gene were mutated. The isolate showed elevated MIC values ({\textgreater}256 $\mu$g ml-1) of linezolid, clindamycin, chloramphenicol and oxacillin. Methicillin resistance was conferred by type I SCCmec element. The strain also harboured lsa(B) gene which encodes an ABC transporter that can effux clindamycin. Interpretation {\&} conclusions: The present study reports the first clinical strain from India with transmissible and multiple mechanisms of linezolid-resistance.

Sporadic cases of NDM-1 positive strains have been reported from different countries suggesting a widespread dissemination. The aim of this study was to detection of Metallobeta- lactamases in gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients in Tehran hospitals. Methods: After specific identification tests, the susceptibility to the antibiotics was done by Kirby Bauer method and broth microdilution. Carbapenem resistant isolates were tested for carbapenemase production using modified Hodge test. Carbapenem resistant strains screened for blaKPC gene and genes encoding Metallo-beta-lactamases by using specific primers targeting blaNDM-1, blaVIM-1, blaVIM-2, blaIMP-1, blaIMP-2, and blaSPM. PCR products were sequenced in both directions. Results: Among 360 collected gram-negative isolates, 23 isolates (6.3{\%}) were resistant to meropenem, 11 isolates (3{\%}) were resistant to ertapenem, and four isolates (1.1{\%}) were resistant to imipenem. Majority of carbapenem resistant isolate were Klebsiella spp. (52.1{\%}) and Escherichia coli (39.1{\%}). Modified Hodge test was positive in 11 (47.8{\%}) of carbapenem resistant isolates showing carbapenemase production. Resistance to third-generation cephalosporins in this study was 65.7{\%} averagely. Of the cephalosporins, cefepime showed the highest activity against all species. In March 2011, we detected a multiple drug resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate that it was resistant to all tested antibiotics except colistin. PCR confirmed that this isolate contained blaNDM-1, blaTEM, blaSHV, and blaCTX-M. Modified Hodge test showed weakly positive result. MBL screening by E-test strips was positive. Class 1 Integron detected in this isolate after PCR using by specific primers. The nucleotide sequence of NDM- 1 gene was submitted to the GenBank databases under accession number JN664262. Conclusion: In this study, detection of blaTEM, blaSHV, blaNDM-1, and blaCTX-M combined with the mobility of class 1 integron in K. pneumoniae suggests that resistance to cephalosporins and carbapenems will continue and these resistances can easily transfer to many different gram negative bacteria.

From April 2010 to March 2012, 193 N. gonorrhoeae isolates were collected and the MICs (mug/ml) to six antimicrobials, including ceftriaxone, were determined. All isolates showed susceptibility to ceftriaxone and cefixime (MIC values, {\textless}0.5 mug/ml), and spectinomycin. The rates of resistance (intermediate susceptibility) to azithromycin, penicillin G, and ciprofloxacin were 3.6{\%} (19.7{\%}), 24.4{\%} (71.0{\%}), and 78.2{\%} (0.5{\%}), respectively.

Twelve patients died, with imipenem-resistant A. baumannii infection contributing to the death of seven patients. The 31 representative A. baumannii isolates were multidrug-resistant and clustered in four distinct clones, each of which contained different carbapenemase genes: clone I was predominant and contained bla(VIM-1), bla(OXA-58) and the intrinsic bla(OXA-66) gene; clone II contained bla(VIM-4), bla(OXA-58) and the intrinsic bla(OXA-69) gene; clone III contained bla(OXA-58) and the intrinsic bla(OXA-69) gene; and clone IV contained only the intrinsic bla(OXA-66) gene.

Resistance to daptomycin or vancomycin among community-acquired MRSA clones is not well described in the literature. We herein report the first case of vancomycin-intermediate, daptomycin-nonsusceptible ST72-MRSA-IV. CASE PRESENTATION: A 45-year-old Japanese man underwent aortic arch prosthesis implantation for treatment of a dissecting aortic aneurysm. Fourteen months later, he developed a prosthetic graft infection of the aortic arch and an anterior mediastinal abscess caused by ST72-MRSA-IV. First-line treatment with vancomycin and rifampicin failed, and daptomycin was thus administered. After several days, the treatment was changed to linezolid because of the re-emergence of fever. The patient's condition resolved and no recurrence or other problems were seen for 1 year post-treatment. The infectious agent was definitively identified as vancomycin-intermediate, daptomycin-nonsusceptible, rifampicin-resistant ST72-MRSA-IV based on culture results and minimum inhibitory concentration testing. CONCLUSION: This case report illustrates the importance of fully understanding the changing epidemiology of infectious agents and the risk factors for the development of antibiotic resistance. Such information will help to minimize the emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant strains.

Between February 2007 and October 2008, 30 K. pneumoniae strains showing decreased susceptibility to carbapenems were collected. PCR and sequencing experiments revealed the presence of blaVIM-1 gene in 14/30 isolates. All the above isolates carried the blaSHV-5 determinant as well; interestingly, 8/14 VIM positive isolates were also CTX-M-1- like producers. VIM-1 positive strains were present in all hospitals. PFGE genomic profiles of the 14/30 isolates showed that 2 different clones, A and B, were responsible for outbreaks. The coexistence in the same bacterial cell of compatible plasmids carrying epidemiologically important emerging resistance genes, such as MBLs and CTX-Ms, is worrisome since it could predict the generation and spread of pan-resistant bacteria and the consequent treatment option limitations that can lead to significant morbidity and mortality.

623,maybe,alsultan2009,article,"Diabetic patients are 10 times more likely to develop Acinetobacter baumannii infections than the rest of the population. Carbapenems are considered one of the very few antibiotics left to treat infections caused by this organism. The aim of this work was to characterise A. baumannii strains isolated from diabetic patients and to investigate whether there is a relationship between certain strains and low-level-carbapenem resistance. Methods: Clinical samples were collected from diabetic patients in hospitals throughout Saudi Arabia from December 2006 to April 2007. API 20 NE, polymorphisms in the 16S-23S-rRNA intergenic region and the presence of a blaOXA-51-like gene were all used for identification. Susceptibility to antimicrobials was determined using agar dilution and disk diffusion methods. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) coupled with sequence analysis of the bla OXA-51-like genes were used for strain characterization. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and multiplex PCR were used to screen for the presence and location of ISAba1 elements and blaOXA-23-like, bla OXA-40-like, and blaOXA-58-like genes respectively. Results: Twenty isolates were identified as A. baumannii and were all highly resistant to 38{\%} of the antibiotics tested and the majority of isolates were also resistant to 50{\%} of the remaining antibiotics. Four strains had low-level meropenem resistance (MIC 4 - 8 mg/L). All isolates were sensitive to imipenem and colistin. Nine strains possessed four novel blaOXA-51-like genes encoding $\beta$-lactamases designated OXA-90, OXA-130, OXA-131 and OXA-132, and four strains contained blaOXA-131 with ISAba1 upstream of the gene structure. PFGE showed five separate clusters of OXA-51-like enzymes and the dissemination of strains carrying the four novel enzymes was clonal. This study showed that new strains of A. baumannii characterised by their new bla OXA-51-like gene have emerged. No genes encoding OXA-23-like, OXA-40-like, or OXA-58-like $\beta$-lactamases were found. Surveillance of A. baumannii harbouring the blaOXA-131-like gene may be an essential step in monitoring their carbapenem resistance phenotype and may assist in preventing their spread in diabetics. {\textcopyright} E.S.I.F.T. srl.",A A Alsultan and A Hamouda and B A Evans and S G B Amyes,1120-009x,Journal of Chemotherapy,"Acinetobacter baumannii,DNA polymorphism,adult,agar dilution,aged,amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid,ampicillin,antibiotic resistance,antibiotic sensitivity,article,bacterial strain,beta lactamase,beta lactamase oxa 130,beta lactamase oxa 131,beta lactamase oxa 132,beta lactamase oxa 23 like,beta lactamase oxa 40 like,beta lactamase oxa 51 like,beta lactamase oxa 58 like,beta lactamase oxa 90,carbapenem,chloramphenicol,ciprofloxacin,clinical article,colistin,diabetes mellitus,diabetic patient,disk diffusion,ertapenem,female,gene sequence,gene structure,gentamicin,human,imipenem,male,meropenem,multiplex polymerase chain reaction,nalidixic acid,nonhuman,nucleotide sequence,ofloxacin,oxacillin,piperacillin plus tazobactam,polymerase chain reaction,pulsed field gel electrophoresis,rifampicin,sequence analysis,sulbactam,tetracycline,unclassified drug",290--295,{Acinetobacter baumannii: Emergence of four strains with novel bla OXA-51-like genes in patients with diabetes mellitus},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l355067778 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=1120009x{\&}id=doi:{\&}atitle=acinetobacter+baumannii{\%}3a+emergence+of+four+strains+with+novel+bla+oxa-51-like+genes,21,2009,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,yes,allison,maybe,zach,zach,ayomide,yes,kw_1.csv,NA,NA,kw_1_1.mex,yes,journal

In recent years, multidrug-resistant pathogens, especially vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), have emerged rapidly worldwide and linezolid exhibited good clinical efficacy against VRE. However, linezolid-resistant bacteria have been reported from Turkey. In April 2011, a 66-year-old paraplegic woman was admitted to our hospital because of an infected decubitis ulcer and empirical antibiotic therapy was started. Since the patient's condition worsened during treatment, she was moved to the intensive care unit. Klebsiella pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium were recovered from tracheal aspirates and blood, respectively. Following three weeks of linezolid therapy blood culture yielded linezolid and vancomycin resistant E.faecium. Linezolid resistance in the VRE strain was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction and sequence analysis, subsequently. Linezolid-resistant two isolates were identified as E.faecium by 16S rRNA sequencing and both isolates had G2576U mutation in 23S rRNA gene. Linezolid resistance which was identified in a vancomycin-resistant E.faecium isolate is a new problem for Turkey.

10690,maybe,kimura2008,article,"Group B streptococci (GBS; Streptococcus agalactiae) are the leading cause of neonatal invasive diseases and are also important pathogens for adults. Penicillins are the drugs of first choice for the treatment of GBS infections, since GBS have been regarded to be uniformly susceptible to penicillins so far. Here we characterize the first strains of GBS with reduced penicillin susceptibility (PRGBS) identified in Japan. Fourteen PRGBS strains were clinically isolated from the sputa of elderly patients from 1995 to 2005; and the MICs of penicillin, oxacillin, and ceftizoxime ranged from 0.25 to 1 microg/ml, 2 to 8 microg/ml, and 4 to 128 microg/ml, respectively. Moreover, some strains were also insusceptible to ampicillin, cefazolin, cefepime, and cefotaxime. All the PRGBS isolates tested possessed a few amino acid substitutions adjacent to the conserved SSN and KSG motifs (amino acids 402 to 404 and 552 to 554, respectively) of PBP 2X, and the amino acid substitutions could be classified into two types, Q557E and V405A. Western blotting analysis of the 14 clinical isolates with anti-PBP 2X-specific serum suggested that the amount of PBP 2X among the 14 PRGBS isolates was reduced, although the 2 ATCC strains produced a significant amount of PBP 2X. The introduction of PRGBS-derived PBP 2X genes into penicillin-susceptible strains through allelic exchange elevated their penicillin insusceptibility, suggesting that these altered PBP 2X genes are responsible for the penicillin insusceptibility in PRGBS strains. In this study, we characterized for the first time PRGBS strains on a molecular basis, although several reports have so far mentioned the existence of beta-lactam-insusceptible GBS from a phenotypic standpoint.",K Kimura and S Suzuki and J Wachino and H Kurokawa and K Yamane and N Shibata and N Nagano and H Kato and K Shibayama and Y Arakawa,0066-4804,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,"Amino Acid Sequence,Amino Acid Substitution,Ampicillin/pharmacology,Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology,Bacterial Proteins/*genetics/metabolism,Blotting, Western,Cefotaxime/pharmacology,Ceftizoxime/pharmacology,Cephalosporins/pharmacology,Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field,Humans,Japan,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Molecular Sequence Data,Oxacillin/pharmacology,Penicillin Resistance/genetics,Penicillin-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism,Penicillins/*pharmacology,Sequence Analysis, DNA,Sequence Homology, Amino Acid,Streptococcal Infections/microbiology,Streptococcus agalactiae/*drug effects/genetics/me",2890--2897,{First molecular characterization of group B streptococci with reduced penicillin susceptibility},NA,52,2008,8,"1098-6596

We report here the first well-characterized case of severe life-threatening CA-MRSA infection in a child living in Rio de Janeiro city. The patient had many complications including hematogenous osteomyelitis and involvement of multiple sites requiring drainage of soft-tissue abscess, and pleural and pericardial empyema. The MRSA isolates recovered were genotyped using PFGE, SCC mec typing and multilocus sequence typing. Disk diffusion tests were performed following Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute recommendations. In addition, the presence of Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) was assessed by PCR amplification, using specific primers for lukF- pv (encoding for the F subunit of the PVL). The bacterial isolates were related to the ST30-SCC mecIV lineage (Oceania Southwest Pacific clone), a PVL producer CA-MRSA previously detected in Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil. Also, the isolates analyzed were susceptible to all non-$\beta$-lactam antibiotics tested. The present report demonstrates that disseminated CA-MRSA disease is also occurring in Rio de Janeiro. Thus, the empirical treatment of moderate or severe infections suspected of being associated with CA-MRSA needs to be reviewed in order to allow prompt initiation of an effective therapy that also covers these microorganisms.",R Rozenbaum and M G Sampaio and G S Batista and A M Garibaldi and G M F Terra and M J Souza and E N Vieira and M C Silva-Carvalho and L A Teixeira and A M S Figueiredo,"0100-879x

About 20{\%} of the patients develop a recurrent infection after the primary episode. The aim of this study was to investigate microbial factors that may contribute to the recurrences of C. difficile infection (CDI). Methods: Thirty-five patients with a primary CDI were enrolled in this study. Faecal samples were collected at 1, 2, 4, 6 and 12 months after the primary infection and analysed for the presence of C. difficile and toxin B. All isolates were investigated by PCR-ribotyping and antimicrobial susceptibility. Results: The mean age of the 35 patients was 74 years and 20 were females and 15 males. Five of the patients died during the followup period due to underlying diseases not directly attributed to CDI. Seven patients harboured the same PCR-ribotype of C. difficile up to 6 months after the initial episode without diarrhoea. However, from four patients a new C. difficile PCR-ribotype was isolated after a period of negative samples. Patient 1 changed the ribotype from 001 to 020; patient 2 changed from 014 to 026; patient 3 changed from 014 to SE36, and patient 4 changed from 014 to 020 and then to 023. Four patients had PCR-ribotype 078 in their initial samples and the same isolate was also found in samples 2-4 months after the primary episode. No PCR-ribotype 027 was found in any samples. Fifty-eight isolates were analysed for antimicrobial susceptibility. All isolates were sensitive to metronidazole, vancomycin, tigecycline, fusidic acid, linezolid and fidaxomicin. Two isolates were resistant to moxifloxacin, tetracycline and rifampicin. Eighteen C. difficile isolates were resistant to clindamycin. Conclusion: Among the 35 patients enrolled in this study, 11 were positive for C. difficile after the initial episode. During the study period, 4/35 (11{\%}) changed the PCR-ribotype. These patients were reinfected with an other C. difficile ribotype. The 078 PCR-ribotype was isolated from four patients. No PCR-ribotype 027 was detected in any samples.

However, prior to implementation in a given setting, the association of specific mutations with specific drug resistance phenotypes should be evaluated.

RESULTS: From April 2010 and March 2011, 725 smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis patients were enrolled and all positive cultures were tested for drug susceptibility. A total of 63 drug resistant and 100 drug sensitive Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex clinical isolates were screened for genetic mutations in katG, inhA, ahpC, rpoB, rpsL, rrs, gidB and embCAB loci using DNA sequencing. Of the 44 isoniazid resistant (INHR) isolates (24 high level, 1 mug/ml and 20 low level, 0.2 mug/ml), 73{\%} (32/44) carried the katG315 and/or the -15 inhA promoter mutations. Of the 24 high level INHR, 17 (70.8{\%}) harbored katG315 mutation, 1 a point mutation (-15C --{\textgreater} T) in the inhA promoter and 6 were (25.0{\%}) wild types. Thus, for INHR high level detection, katG315 mutation had a specificity and a sensitivity of 100{\%} and 70.8{\%} respectively. Of the 20 low level INHR, 10 (50.0{\%}) had a -15C --{\textgreater} T mutation in the inhA promoter region, and 1 (2.2{\%}) a -32G --{\textgreater} A mutation in the ahpC promoter region. All of the 7 rifampicin resistant (RIFR) isolates carried mutations in the rpoB gene (at codons Ser531Leu (71.4{\%}), His526Asp (14.3{\%}), and Asp516Val (14.3{\%})). Of the 27 streptomycin resistant (SMR) isolates, 7 carried mutations at the rpsL and the gidB genes. 1 of the 2 ethambutol resistant (EMBR) isolates displayed a mutation in embB gene. CONCLUSION: This study provided the first molecular investigation assessing the correlation of phenotypic to genotypic characteristics on MTB isolates from the Central Region of Cameroon using DNA sequencing. Mutations on rpoB, katG315 and -15 point mutations in inhA promoter loci could be used as markers for RIF and INH -resistance detection respectively.",E M Tekwu and L K Sidze and J P Assam and J C Tedom and S Tchatchouang and G G Makafe and A L Wetewale and C Kuaban and S Eyangoh and F Ntoumi and V N Beng and M Frank,1471-2180,BMC Microbiol,"*Drug Resistance, Bacterial,Antitubercular Agents/*pharmacology,Bacterial Proteins/*genetics,Cameroon,DNA, Bacterial/chemistry/genetics,Data Collection,Humans,Molecular Sequence Data,Mutation,Mycobacterium tuberculosis/*drug effects/*genetics,Promoter Regions, Genetic,Sequence Analysis, DNA,Tuberculosis/*microbiology",113,{Sequence analysis for detection of drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex isolates from the Central Region of Cameroon},NA,14,2014,NA,"1471-2180

5146,yes,dhotre2016,article,"CONTEXT: The genus Streptococcus consists of more than 65 species. The taxonomic classification of these members is not well-defined. Among the viridans group streptococci (VGS), there are major taxonomic changes by the addition of many new species; whereas, most of the new strains are of animal origin and only a few have been reported to be isolated from humans. Rare and unusual species of VGS such as Streptococcus thoraltensis, S. pluranimalium and S. hyointestinalis are normally associated with different animals. Their isolation from human being is not yet reported. AIM: To find out the rare and unusual species of viridans group streptococci from human oral cavity. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: A case-controlled study carried out at hospital-based dental services in a tertiary care hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Subgingival plaque samples of the tooth were collected from 80 patients (34 with periodontitis and 46 without periodontitis) undergoing tooth extraction. Cultures were subcultured onto special media such as Tryptone Soya blood Agar supplemented with strepto supplement and Mutans-Sanguis Agar. Identification of strains and antimicrobial susceptibilities were measured as minimum inhibitory concentration using Vitek 2 (BioMerieux, Paris, France) automated system. RESULTS: We have identified three strains of VGS - S. thoraltensis, S. pluranimalium and S. hyointestinalis from subgingival plaque samples from patients with periodontitis. S. thoraltensis and S. pluranimalium were found to be resistant to most of the antibiotics.

1614,yes,barvalia2015,article,"Introduction Hafnia Alvei is a type of strain belonging to genus Hafnia, a gram-negative bacterium that comprise of Enterobacteriaceae family. It can cause intra-abdominal infections and extraintestinal infections such as pneumonia, skin abscesses and septicemia. We report a case of a woman developing empyema and lung abscess from Hafnia Alvei post gastric bypass surgery. Case Presentation A 46-year-old female with diabetes mellitus type 2, systemic hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, morbid obesity underwent gastric bypass surgery. During postoperative period she developed a small anastomotic leak and complaint of chronic left sided chest pain. On CT scan, a 5.5 x 1.9 cm sub-diaphragmatic perisplenic abscess was discovered along with a tiny bubble of air and left sided pleural effusion. Due to close proximity to diaphragm and spleen abscess was amenable to drainage but treated with broad-spectrum intravenous vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactum for 3 weeks. Subsequent CT scans over 6-8 months showed increase in size of abscess and a new air fluid level inside the left sided pleural effusion. Further follow up imaging after a year revealed reduction in sub-diaphragmatic abscess but now a bronchopleural fistula and 5.9 cm lung abscess (see figure) was formed at left lung base. She was then started on intravenous ceftriaxone and azithromycin. Sputum sample showed pure culture of H. Alvei with resistance to ceftriaxone, tetracycline and ampicillin-sulbactum while susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, levofloxacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactum and aztreonam. Although there was slow resolution of abscess, new ground glass opacities and consolidation developed throughout left lung. Currently, she is being treated with intravenous meropenem and cardiothoracic surgery team is consulted. Discussion To our knowledge, this is a first case of Hafnia Alvei infection causing empyema from a perisplenic abscess after gastric bypass surgery. Being an enteric pathogen, alteration in bacterial flora is the most likely mechanism. One study showed H. alvei isolates from respiratory, gastrointestinal and urogenital tract however only 25{\%} (20 out of 80 samples) of all isolates were seen in pure cultures. In our case, antibiotic susceptibility was similar to isolates described in previous case reports except the resistance to 3rd generation cephalosporins. We suspect that our patient could have had a better response with surgical drainage of abscess in addition to antibiotics. In conclusion, although Hafnia Alvei is a rarely identified pathogen it can lead to serious complications if not identified and treated promptly.

In this study, we characterized a carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae isolate that produced both KPC-2 and IMP-4 type carbapenemases. A clinical isolate of K. pneumoniae, resistant to both meropenem and imipenem, was recovered from a urine sample. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined using the broth microdilution method and Etest (bioMerieux, France). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) were used for gene type analysis. bla (KPC) and the encoding genes of ESBLs and plasmid-mediated AmpC enzymes were polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified and sequenced. Plasmids were analyzed by transformation, enzyme restriction and Southern blot. PCR analysis revealed that the isolate was simultaneously carrying bla (KPC-2), bla (IMP-4), bla (TEM-1), and bla (OKP-B) genes. MLST assigned the isolate to a novel sequence type, ST476. bla (KPC-2)-harbouring plasmids of the isolate and comparative strains had similar EcoRI and HindIII restriction maps, while IMP-4-harbouring plasmids had variable HindIII restriction maps. Coexistence of bla (KPC-2) and bla (IMP-4) was probably due to bla (IMP-4)-harbouring plasmid transmission into KPC-2-producing K. pneumoniae (ST476).

5226,yes,diene2011,article,"Objective: Enterobacter aerogenes is a common and important human opportunistic pathogen that may cause a wide variety of nosocomial infections. In this study we report the complete genome sequence of an E. aerogenes strain isolated in our institution which showed successive resistance to all available antibiotics including imipenem and colistin in a patient who died from this infection despite antibiotic treatment. The aim of our study was to identify and decipher all resistance determinants of this pan-resistant isolate using genome sequencing approach. Method: Whole shotgun sequencing was used to fully sequence this genome. The shotgun libraries of 4 and 9 kb generated were analyzed and assembled using Phred-Phrap and Consed software suite. Genome annotation was performed using online bioserver RAST server (Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology). Standard PCR amplification and sequencing were used to improve sequence regions of low quality on genomic contigs and to characterize putative mutations on candidate genes involved in antibiotic resistance. Principal findings: The genome of E. aerogenes comprises a chromosomal DNA estimated at 5.37 Mb with a G+C content of 55{\%} and one circular plasmid of 162.182 bp in size. The functional annotation of the chromosome gave a total of 5113 predicted coding sequences (CDS) with 3197 (62.53{\%}) being assigned to a biological function including as many as 30 antibiotic resistance encoding genes, 49 antiseptic and heavy-metal resistance encoding genes and more than 100 efflux pump systems. Surprisingly, as compared to other available complete genomes, E. aerogenes genome appears to be more closely related to Klebsiella pneumoniae and not to E. cloacae species. Interestingly, the E. aerogenes conjugative plasmid carries many mobile genetic elements including antibiotic, antiseptics, and heavy metal resistance encoding genes. Finally, we report here the potential molecular mechanism of colistin resistance in this clinical isolate mediated by a single chromosome mutation (G157A) on pmrA gene as compared to a parental susceptible isolate in the PmrAB two-component regulatory system known to be involved in polymyxin resistance. Conclusion: Our study confirms that whole genome sequence is a critical approach to quickly decipher the resistome of any bacterium of clinical relevance.

7979,maybe,gurjav2016,article,"Background Mongolia has high and rising rates of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Spatio-temporal and programmatic evidence suggests a major contribution from MDR-TB transmission, but genotypic evidence has not been assessed. Methods All MDR-TB cases identified during 2012 were examined. Demographic and bacteriological data were obtained from the National Tuberculosis Reference Laboratory. Isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from culture-confirmed category 1 treatment failures were genotyped using 24-loci mycobacterium interspersed repetitive unit (MIRU-24) analysis. Results Of the 210 MDR-TB cases identified, 115 (54.8{\%}) were treatment failures (34.8{\%} category 1; 20.0{\%} category 2). Streptomycin resistance was present in 156 (74.3{\%}) cases; including 55/73 (75.3{\%}) category 1 treatment failures who had never been exposed to streptomycin. Among category 1 treatment failures, Beijing lineage strains predominated (88.0{\%}; 59/67 of genotyped isolates). MIRU-24 clustering was documented in 62.7{\%} (42/67) of strains; 55.2{\%} (37/67) remained clustered when drug susceptibility test results were considered. In total 59.5{\%} (25/42) of clustered strains were Beijing lineage and demonstrated in-vitro resistance to all first-line drugs tested. Conclusion The MDR-TB epidemic in Mongolia appears to be driven by primary transmission of Beijing lineage strains resistant to all first-line drugs.

Although multi- and extensively-drug resistant (MDR/XDR) GN infections are emerging, very few data are available on IE due to these microrganisms. METHODS: In this study, we describe the clinical characteristics, course and outcome of five contemporary, definite, MDR/XDR GNIE cases seen at our centre. RESULTS: All patients had been admitted to a hospital during the 6months before IE onset, 2 were on hemodialysis and 3 on intravenous medications. Three of the 5 cases were hospital-acquired. Intracardiac prosthetic devices were present in all cases (3 central venous lines, 2 prosthetic heart valves, 2 pacemakers). Mean Charlson comorbidity index was 5.8. Causative pathogens were XDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2 cases), XDR Acinetobacter baumannii, MDR Burkolderia cepacia and MDR Escherichia coli (1 case each). Concomitant pathogens with a MDR/XDR phenotype were isolated in 4 patients. Both valves and intracardiac devices and left and right sides of the heart were involved. The rate of complications was high. Antibiotic treatment hinged on the use of colistin, a carbapenem or both. Cardiovascular surgical procedures were performed in 3 patients. Despite aggressive therapeutic regimens, outcomes were poor. Clearance of bacteremia was obtained in 3 patients, in-hospital death occurred in 3 patients, only 1 patient survived during follow up. CONCLUSIONS: MDR/XDR GN are emerging as a cause of IE in carriers of intracardiac prostheses with extensive healthcare contacts and multiple comorbidities.

Few studies to date have characterized the rates of S. aureus mupirocin resistance in pediatric populations. We retrospectively studied 358 unique S. aureus isolates obtained from 249 children seen in a predominantly out-patient setting by the Division of Pediatric Dermatology at a major academic center in New York City between 1 May 2012 and 17 September 2013. Mupirocin resistance rates and the associated risk factors were determined using a logistic regression analysis. In our patient population, 19.3{\%} of patients had mupirocin-resistant S. aureus isolates at the time of their first culture, and 22.1{\%} of patients with S. aureus infection had a mupirocin-resistant isolate at some time during the study period. Overall, 31.3{\%} of all S. aureus isolates collected during the study period were resistant to mupirocin. Prior mupirocin use was strongly correlated (odds ratio [OR] = 26.5; P = {\textless}0.001) with mupirocin resistance. Additional risk factors for mupirocin resistance included methicillin resistance, atopic dermatitis (AD), epidermolysis bullosa (EB), immunosuppression, and residence in northern Manhattan and the Bronx. Resistance to mupirocin is widespread in children with dermatologic complaints in the New York City area, and given the strong association with mupirocin exposure, it is likely that mupirocin use contributes to the increased resistance.

In this study, we report for the first time an outbreak of a novel Enterobacter sp. harbouring blaCTX-M-15 in a neonatal unit in Tanzania. Seventeen Gram-negative enteric isolates from neonatal blood cultures were studied. Antibiotic susceptibility was assessed by disc diffusion testing, and the presence of the blaCTX-M-15 gene was established by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. Isolates were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Identification by biochemical profiling was followed by nucleotide sequencing of 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA), rpoB and hsp60 alleles. Environmental sampling was done and control measures were established. Isolates were initially misidentified based on their fermentation characteristics and agglutination as Salmonella enterica serotype Paratyphi. All isolates were resistant to multiple antibiotics, except for ciprofloxacin and carbapenems, and were found to harbour blaCTX-M-15 on a 291-kb narrow-range plasmid. PFGE analysis indicated the clonal outbreak of a single strain, infecting 17 neonates with a case fatality rate of 35{\%}. The same strain was isolated from a milk bucket. Phylogenetic analysis using 16S rDNA, rpoB and hsp60 sequences permitted no definitive identification, clustering the strains in the Enterobacter cloacae complex with similarities of 92-98.8{\%}. The data describe an outbreak of a novel blaCTX-M-15-positive, multiresistant Enterobacter strain in an African neonatal unit that can easily be misidentified taxonomically.

2587,maybe,breathnach2012,article,"BACKGROUND: Multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDR-P) expressing VIM-metallo-beta-lactamase is an emerging infection control problem. The source of many such infections is unclear, though there are reports of hospital outbreaks of P. aeruginosa related to environmental contamination, including tap water. AIM: We describe two outbreaks of MDR-P, sensitive only to colistin, in order to highlight the potential for hospital waste-water systems to harbour this organism. METHODS: The outbreaks were investigated by a combination of descriptive epidemiology, inspection and microbiological sampling of the environment, and molecular strain typing. FINDINGS: The outbreaks occurred in two English hospitals; each involved a distinct genotype of MDR-P. One outbreak was hospital-wide, involving 85 patients, and the other was limited to four cases in one specialized medical unit. Extensive environmental sampling in each outbreak yielded MDR-P only from the waste-water systems. Inspection of the environment and estates records revealed many factors that may have contributed to contamination of clinical areas, including faulty sink, shower and toilet design, clean items stored near sluices, and frequent blockages and leaks from waste pipes. Blockages were due to paper towels, patient wipes, or improper use of bedpan macerators. Control measures included replacing sinks and toilets with easier-to-clean models less prone to splashback, educating staff to reduce blockages and inappropriate storage, reviewing cleaning protocols, and reducing shower flow rates to reduce flooding. These measures were followed by significant reductions in cases. CONCLUSION: The outbreaks highlight the potential of hospital waste systems to act as a reservoir of MDR-P and other nosocomial pathogens.",A S Breathnach and M D Cubbon and R N Karunaharan and C F Pope and T D Planche,0195-6701,J Hosp Infect,"*Disease Outbreaks,*Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial,Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology,Hospitals,Humans,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Molecular Typing,Pseudomonas Infections/*epidemiology/microbiology,Pseudomonas aeruginosa/classification/*drug effect,Waste Water/*microbiology",19--24,{Multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa outbreaks in two hospitals: association with contaminated hospital waste-water systems},NA,82,2012,1,"1532-2939

Its bla{\textless}inf{\textgreater}KPC{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} determinant was carried by a ColE1 plasmid, pKBuS13, that showed the Tn4401b::bla{\textless}inf{\textgreater}KPC-2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} transposon inserted into the regulatory region of an Xer site-specific recombination locus. This interfered with the correct resolution of plasmid multimers into monomers, lowering plasmid stability and leading to overestimation of the number of plasmids harbored by a single host cell. Sequencing of the fragments adjacent to Tn4401b detected a region that did not have significant matches in databases other than the genome of a carbapenem-resistant Escherichia coli strain collected during the same year at a hospital in Boston.

S. boydii strain 2246 with resistance to ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone and azithromycin was isolated from a human case of watery diarrhea in a Chinese public hospital. Resistance in strain 2246 to ceftriaxone and azithromycin was attributable to the presence of blaCTX-M-14, and erm(B) and mph(A), respectively, which were co-located on a multidrug-resistant (MDR) plasmid p2246-CTXM. p2246-CTXM represented a novel IncFII-type MDR plasmid with a very complex chimera structure. Its master backbone was genetically closely related to the R100 plasmid, but p2246-CTXM had evolved to integrate additional R100-unrelated backbone regions as well as massive exogenous mobile elements that carried multiple resistance determinants. In p2246-CTXM, erm(B) together with its leading peptide gene erm(C), mph(A) together with its regulatory genes mrx and mphR(A), and blaCTX-M-14 were captured by three different mobile elements Tn6295, the IS26-mph(A)-mrx-mphR(A)-IS6100 unit, and a truncated ISEcp1-blaCTX-M-14-IS903D-iroN transposition unit, respectively, all of which were harbored in a large Tn3-family transposon Tn6285. p2246-CTXM still carried additional resistance determinants mer (mercury resistance), aacA4 (aminoglycoside resistance), cmlA1 (chloramphenicol resistance), and qacED1 (quaternary ammonium compound resistance).

16267,maybe,peleg2007,article,"Objectives: Tigecycline has shown in vitro activity against Acinetobacter baumannii. Yet, published clinical experience with tigecycline use outside clinical trials is lacking. We describe, for the first time, bloodstream infection caused by tigecycline-non-susceptible A. baumannii occurring in patients receiving tigecycline for other indications. The possible mechanisms of resistance and pharmacokinetic limitations of the drug are addressed. Methods: The clinical records of involved patients were systematically reviewed. Tigecycline susceptibility testing was initially performed using the Etest method and confirmed by agar dilution. Involved isolates underwent PFGE and exposure to phenyl-arginine-$\beta$-naphthylamide (PA$\beta$N), an efflux pump inhibitor. Results: Two patients developed A. baumannii bloodstream infection while receiving tigecycline. Tigecycline was administered for other indications for 9 and 16 days, respectively, before the onset of A. baumannii infection. Patient 1 died of overwhelming A. baumannii infection and Patient 2 recovered after a change in antibiotic therapy. The MICs of tigecycline were 4 and 16 mg/L, respectively. Both isolates had a multidrug-resistant phenotype and were genotypically unrelated. After exposure to PA$\beta$N, the MICs reduced to 1 and 4 mg/L, respectively. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first clinical description of bloodstream infection caused by tigecycline-non-susceptible A. baumannii. Such resistance appears to be at least partly attributable to an efflux pump mechanism. Given the reported low serum tigecycline levels, we urge caution when using this drug for treatment of A. baumannii bloodstream infection.

A novel acquired carbapenemase, New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1 (NDM-1), has recently been described in the United Kingdom and Sweden, mostly in patients who had received care on the Indian subcontinent. We conducted a survey among 29 European countries (the European Union Member States, Iceland and Norway) to gather information on the spread of NDM-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae in Europe, on public health responses and on available national guidance on detection, surveillance and control. A total of 77 cases were reported from 13 countries from 2008 to 2010. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most frequently reported species with 54{\%}. Among 55 cases with recorded travel history, 31 had previously travelled or been admitted to a hospital in India or Pakistan and five had been hospitalised in the Balkan region. Possible nosocomial acquisition accounted for 13 of 77 cases. National guidance on NDM-1 detection was available in 14 countries and on NDM-1 control in 11 countries. In conclusion, NDM-1 is spreading across Europe, where it is frequently linked to a history of healthcare abroad, but also to emerging nosocomial transmission. National guidance in response to the threat of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae is available in approximately half of the surveyed European countries.

15329,yes,oconnor2016,article,"Background Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) may cause healthcare-associated infections with high mortality rates. New Delhi metallo-$\beta$-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) is among the most recently discovered carbapenemases. Aim To report the first outbreak of NDM-1 CPE in Ireland, including microbiological and epidemiological characteristics, and assessing the impact of infection prevention and control measures. Methods This was a retrospective microbiological and epidemiological review. Cases were defined as patients with a CPE-positive culture. Contacts were designated as roommates or ward mates. Findings This outbreak involved 10 patients with a median age of 71 years (range: 45â90), located in three separate but affiliated healthcare facilities. One patient was infected (the index case); the nine others were colonized. Nine NDM-1-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, an NDM-1-producing Escherichia coli and a K.Â pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Enterobacter cloacae were detected between week 24, 2014 and week 37, 2014. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis demonstrated similarity. NDM-1-positive isolates were meropenem resistant with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from 12 to 32Â $\mu$g/mL. All were tigecycline susceptible (MICs â¤1Â $\mu$g/mL). One isolate was colistin resistant (MIC 4.0Â $\mu$g/mL; mcr-1 gene not detected). In 2015, four further NDM-1 isolates were detected. Conclusion The successful management of this outbreak was achieved via the prompt implementation of enhanced infection prevention and control practices to prevent transmission. These patients did not have a history of travel outside of Ireland, but several had frequent hospitalizations in Ireland, raising concerns regarding the possibility of increasing but unrecognized prevalence of NDM-1 and potential decline in value of travel history as a marker of colonization risk.",C O'Connor and M Cormican and T W Boo and E McGrath and B Slevin and A O'Gorman and M Commane and S Mahony and E O'Donovan and J Powell and R Monahan and C Finnegan and M G Kiernan and J C Coffey and L Power and N H O'Connell and C P Dunne,"1532-2939

5201,yes,diaz2013,article,"INTRODUCTION: Salmonella Enteritidis is recognized worldwide as one of the main agents of human gastrointestinal infection. Several reports indicate the presence of isolates with decreased sensitivity to ciprofloxacin that can lead to a delayed response or the development of resistance during treatment. OBJECTIVE: To describe and characterize isolates of Salmonella Enteritidis associated to an outbreak of food-borne diseases in Popayan, Cauca. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten Salmonella Enteritidis isolates from nine patients and one food sample (chicken sandwich) were analyzed by biochemical tests, serotyping and antimicrobial sensitivity. The minimum inhibitory concentration to ciprofloxacin was determined by E-test and the genetic profile of the isolates was tested by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) with XbaI and Blnl enzymes. RESULTS: Salmonella Enteritidis was identified in all isolates. They were resistant to nalidixic acid and had a decreased sensitivity to ciprofloxaxin between 0.25 and 0.5 mug/ml; all isolates were sensitive to all the other antimicrobials we tested. Ten isolates were grouped by PFGE with the XbaI enzyme in the COIN11.JEG.X01.0038 pattern, and seven isolates were confirmed with the BlnI enzyme using the COIN11.JEG.A26.0009 pattern. CONCLUSION: We report for the first time an outbreak of nalidixic acid-resistant Salmonella Enteritidis in Colombia and confirmed by phenotypic and genotypic analysis the association between the isolates from patients and the chicken sandwich as the source of infection.",M A Diaz and P L Diaz and E C Rodriguez and L A Montano and D M Gartner and M E Vernaza and V Eljach and M E Realpe,"0120-4157 (print)

18401,maybe,sarovich2012,article,"Burkholderia pseudomallei, a bacterium that causes the disease melioidosis, is intrinsically resistant to many antibiotics. First-line antibiotic therapy for treating melioidosis is usually the synthetic $\beta$-lactam, ceftazidime (CAZ), as almost all B. pseudomallei strains are susceptible to this drug. However, acquired CAZ resistance can develop in vivo during treat- ment with CAZ, which can lead to mortality if therapy is not switched to a different drug in a timely manner. Serial B. pseudomallei isolates obtained from an acute Thai melioidosis patient infected by a CAZ susceptible strain, who ultimately succumbed to infection despite being on CAZ therapy for the duration of their infection, were analyzed. Isolates that developed CAZ resistance due to a proline to serine change at position 167 in the $\beta$-lactamase PenA were identi- fed. Importantly, these CAZ resistant isolates remained sensitive to the alternative melioidosis treatments; namely, amoxicillin-clavulanate, imipenem, and meropenem. Lastly, real-time polymerase chain reaction-based assays capable of rapidly identifying CAZ resistance in B. pseudomallei isolates at the position 167 mutation site were developed. The ability to rapidly identify the emergence of CAZ resistant B. pseudomallei populations in melioidosis patients will allow timely alterations in treatment strategies, thereby improving patient outcomes for this serious disease. {\textcopyright} 2012 Sarovich et al, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.",D S Sarovich and E P Price and D Limmathurotsakul and J M Cook and A T {von Schulze} and S R Wolken and P Keim and C Refidaff and T Pearson,1178-6973,Infection and Drug Resistance,"Burkholderia pseudomallei,abscess,adult,amino acid substitution,amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid,antibiotic resistance,article,bacterium isolate,beta lactamase,bioassay,case report,ceftazidime,ceftriaxone,clindamycin,clonal species,drug response,drug treatment failure,dyspnea,fever,human,hypotension,imipenem,immunofluorescence test,leg disease,male,melioidosis,meropenem,mixed infection,nonhuman,penA protein,pleura effusion,proline,real time polymerase chain reaction,recurrent disease,reinfection,sensitivity analysis,serine,thorax radiography,treatment duration,unclassified drug",129--132,{Development of ceftazidime resistance in an acute burkholderia pseudomallei infection},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l368202488 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=11786973{\&}id=doi:{\&}atitle=development+of+ceftazidime+resistance+in+an+acute+burkholderia+pseudomallei+infection,5,2012,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,maybe,brooke,maybe,ayomide,ayomide,mushtaq_2,yes,md_2.csv,NA,NA,md_2_2.mex,yes,journal

15459,maybe,oksuz2012,article,"Background: Vibrios have been recognized as human pathogens, and they can be acquired through either ingestion of contaminated seafood or contact of traumatized skin with seawater. V.alginolyticus occasionally causes life-threatening infections in immunocompromised individuals. We describe a case of sepsis due to V. alginolyticus isolated from catheter of 19-year-old patient with hypercholesterolemyType 2a while he was 7 years old. The patient was admitted with high fever. He was applied routinally lipid aferesis. A catheter had inserted to him before one and a half years. Methods: Blood cultures were sent from the catheter and peripheral vein of the patient to the laboratory and evaluated on the BACTEC 9120 system (Becton Dickinson, USA). The same day, a positive signal was taken from the cathether while blood culture obtained from the peripheral vein remained negative. The positive blood culture bottle was cultured on sheep-blood and chocolated agar. After 24 hours, straight or curved, Gram-negative, oxidasepositive colonies were seen on blood and chocolated agar. Yellow colonies were seen on thiosulfate-citrate-bile salts-sucrose (TCBS) agar after 24 hours of incubation. The identification was confirmed with another biochemical tests. At the same time, the patient's general situation was deteriorated and went to sepsis. Blood cultures were sent again and the same bacteria was isolated again. Results: The result of blood cultures was reported as V.alginolyticus. The bacteria were identified as V. alginolyticus by the API system (bioMerieux, France) at a 95.3{\%} confidence level and by the VITEK 2 system (bioMerieux, France) at a 93{\%} confidence level. The strain was only found to be resistant to ampicillin, but susceptible to the other antibiotic classes. The patient therapy improved by early diagnosis and appropriate and discharged. An identifiable source for this infection could not be found. Conclusion: In conclusion, rapid and correct identification of the bacteria and early administration of appropriate antibiotics is essential for controlling invasive Vibrio infections, such as V.alginolyticus sepsis, especially in immunocompromised hosts.

Using a similar protocol, we studied a previously cryopreserved culture broth of blood sample from a patient who had succumbed to an acute onset of fulminant pulmonary illness. We report that two phases of microbial growth were observed in the re-initiated culture. Biochemical and genomic characterization revealed microbes isolated from the first phase of growth were new Afipia species of Bradyrhizobiaceae, tentatively named A. cberi with a â¼ 5 MB chromosome that was different from those of all previously known Afipia microbes including the newly discovered A. septicemium. The microbes isolated from the second phase of growth were prominent sugar assimilators, novel Phyllobacteriaceae, phylogenetically most closely related to Mesorhizobium and tentatively named M. hominis with a â¼ 5.5 MB chromosome. All A. cberi isolates carry a circular â¼ 140 KB plasmid. Some M. hominis isolates possess a circular â¼ 412 KB plasmid that can be lost in prolonged culture or passage. No antibiotics resistant genes could be identified in both of the A. cberi and M. hominis plasmids. Antibiotic susceptibility studies using broth culture systems revealed isolates of A. cberi could be sensitive to some antibiotics, but all isolates of M. hominis were resistant to essentially all tested antibiotics. However, the cell-free antibiotics susceptibility test results may not be applicable to clinical treatment against the microbes that are known to be capable of intracellular growth. It remains to be determined if the 2 previously unknown Rhizobiales were indeed pathogenic and played a role in the pulmonary disease process in this patient.

In November 2010 the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) graded Ireland as only having sporadic occurrence of CPE. Aim: To describe the epidemiological and molecular typing analysis of the first outbreak of OXA-48-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae in an Irish tertiary care referral centre. Methods: Sixteen OXA-48-producing K.pneumoniae isolates were detected, from both clinical and screening specimens, and analysed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and by multi-locus sequence typing. Findings: Typing analysis revealed that two outbreak strains were circulating in the hospital, one among surgical patients and one among medical patients. The 'medical strain' ST13 had already been identified as an internationally disseminated clone, whereas the 'surgical strain' ST221 had not previously been reported as an OXA-48-carrying strain. Conclusion: Although the outbreak on surgical wards was successfully controlled by implementing strict infection control measures, intermittent detection of individual patients carrying the 'medical strain' of OXA-48 K.pneumoniae has persisted since then. The experience from this outbreak suggests that OXA-48 K.pneumoniae is endemic at low level in the healthcare setting in the Dublin region. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Healthcare Infection Society.",C Wrenn and D O'Brien and D Keating and C Roche and L Rose and A Ronayne and L Fenelon and S Fitzgerald and B Crowley and K Schaffer,"1532-2939

She presented with a 4 month history of persistent occipital headaches associated with intermittent nausea and vomiting. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed a large enhancing lesion in the right cerebellar hemisphere with surrounding ring lesions, suggestive of an intracranial neoplasm with metastases. However, tuberculoma of the brain was confirmed based on histology of the excision biopsy and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture results: Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to isoniazid (INH) with sensitivity to other standard drugs, including fluoroquinolones, was cultured from CSF.

14509,yes,mudzikati2015,article,"Background: Septicaemia is the third most common cause of neonatal death after prematurity and birth asphyxia. The prevalence of neonatal sepsis and the spectrum of causative microorganisms fluctuates over time, thus facility-specific surveillance of neonatal bloodstream infections is important. Increasing levels of antimicrobial resistance documented worldwide, necessitate regular monitoring of institutional resistance patterns to ensure appropriate and effective empirical antimicrobial therapy. Method: The laboratory blood culture reports and patient records from a neonatal unit at a Botswana referral hospital were retrospectively reviewed to determine the one-year prevalence of neonatal sepsis and the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of common pathogens. Results: Of 909 neonates investigated for suspected sepsis using 1 119 blood cultures, 89 (9.8{\%}) had laboratory-confirmed episodes of bloodstream infection (septicaemia). The most prevalent pathogens included Klebsiella pneumoniae (29.4{\%}), group B streptococcus (16.3{\%}) and Escherichia coli (11.9{\%}). Blood culture contamination rates were high at 18.6{\%} (208/1 119). Gramnegative pathogens showed low susceptibility to gentamicin (40{\%}) and cefotaxime (47{\%}), but high susceptibility to amikacin (86{\%}). Streptococci and enterococci were moderately sensitive to ampicillin (79{\%}), and fully susceptible to vancomycin. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was not isolated. Exposure to maternal syphilis and previous antibiotic exposure were significantly associated with neonatal septicaemia. Conclusion: Neonatal sepsis is common, with a predominance of Gram-negative pathogens. The high rate of blood culture contamination should be addressed. Emerging antibiotic resistance may require clinicians to review currently used antibiotics for the empirical treatment of late-onset neonatal septicaemia.",L Mudzikati and A Dramowski,"2220-1084

Genotyping of all 93 MRSA isolates resolved 5 genotypes. Most (91{\%}) isolates were assigned to sequence type 834.

16802,yes,porres-osante2014a,article,"Objectives: To characterize the mechanisms involved in carbapenem resistance, as well as the genetic elements supporting their mobilization, in a multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli isolate. Methods: The E. coli isolate was obtained from a patient with fatal urinary sepsis. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by the disc diffusion and agar dilution methods. The E. coli molecular type and phylogroup were determined using multilocus sequence typing and the triple PCR technique, respectively. PCR and sequencing were used for virulence and resistance genotype characterization. Plasmid content and gene location were analysed by S1-PFGE, I-Ceu1-PFGE and hybridization experiments. Transformation assays were performed. Results: The E. coli strain, typed as ST448 and phylogroup B1, was resistant to all tested antibiotics except fosfomycin, tigecycline and tetracycline. The following resistance and virulence genetic structures were obtained: ISKpn7 + blaKPC-3 + ISKpn6 linked to Tn4401; tnpR + aac(6')-Ib'-9 + aadA1 + blaOXA-9 + tnpR + blaTEM-1a + tnpB + strB + strA + sul2; intI1 + blaVIM-1 + aac(6')-Ib' + aphA15 + aadA1 + catB2 + qacE$\Delta$1-sul1 + orf5; ISEcp1 + blaCMY-2; IS26 + blaSHV-12; aph(3')-I; aac(3)-IV; floR; catA; and fimA. Mutations in the ampC promoter (-18, -1 and +58) and substitutions in the GyrA (Ser-83âLeu and Asp-87âAsn) and ParC (Ser-80âIle) proteins were observed. IncFII (ST2), IncA/C and ColETP plasmids of 145.5, 87 and {\textless}2 kb, respectively, were found. The blaVIM-1 gene was located in a non-typeable plasmid of {\textgreater}300 kb, and the blaKPC-3 gene in the 145.5 kb IncFII plasmid. Transformant strains carried the IncFII and ColETP plasmids, and the blaKPC-3, blaTEM-1a, blaOXA-9, aadA1, aac(6')-Ib'-9, aac(3)-IV and floR genes. Conclusions: This is the first report of the co-production of KPC-3, VIM-1, SHV-12, OXA-9 and CMY-2 in a unique clinical multiresistant E. coli isolate. The dissemination of these genes on mobile genetic elements is alarming and complicates antimicrobial therapies. {\textcopyright} The Author 2014.

7113,maybe,geer2015,article,"LEARNING OBJECTIVE {\#}1: To understand the presentation of primary and recurrent Tuberculosis and to understand how to differentiate TB vs. MDR TB vs. XDR TB and the treatment challenges involved with each. CASE: This is a 33 yo Filipino woman w/ no significant PMH except a prior+PPD in the Philippines in '99 s/p INH, rifampin and Ethionamide who presented w/ F/C, SOB and DOE after doing a marathon in Kentucky and enjoying some cave exploration. She was found to have bibasilar infiltrates w/ a cavitary mass and positive sputum for TB. She was empirically started on INH PZA EMB AMIK Cyclo Avelox but later found to be resistant to all first line drugs and eventually discharged on a regimen of PAS, Cycloserine, Ethionamide, Linezolid, Avelox and Amikacin after 3 months. Her sputum sample was sent to the CDC and National Jewish where she was further found to be resistant to Avelox and Ethionamide. In collaboration with the CDC she was eventually started on Bedaquiline as she was taken off the Amikacin after 6 months of therapy because of hearing loss and at this time is doing well as an outpatient w/ clearance of her sputum. She is doing well and will contnue on a treatment regimen for 2 years from original sputum clearance. DISCUSSION: Per the WHO in 2012, 8.6 million people fell ill with TB and 1.3 million died from TB. In 2013 Connecticut reported 62 cases of TB and only one patient who had MDR TB because of her resistance to first line agents rifampin and INH as well as ethambutol, pyrazinamide, xifloxicin. Extensively drug resistant TB (XDR TB) is a rare type of MDR TB that is resistant to isoniazid and rifampin, plus any fluoroquinolone and at least one of three injectable second-line drugs (i.e., amikacin, kanamycin, or capreomycin). MDR is a growing problem in the developing world with 450,000 cases reported in 2012 w/ 9.6 {\%} having XDR TB. The risk of MDR TB is rapidly increasing as in 2011 there were only 310,000 cases of MDR TB reported and this will present new challenges for future management of TB as more antibiotics become ineffective. Newer medications are being developed such as Bedaquiline to combat this growing threat of MDRTB with more in the pipeline as well. However as MDR and XDRTB become more prevalent here in the Unites States, we will need more effective regimens and protocols to deal with them.",B A Geer and N Nair,0884-8734,Journal of General Internal Medicine,"Filipino (people),Philippines,United States,amikacin,antibiotic agent,bedaquiline,capreomycin,cave,coughing,cycloserine,doe (deer),doe (mammal),drug therapy,ethambutol,ethionamide,extensively drug resistant tuberculosis,female,hearing impairment,human,internal medicine,isoniazid,kanamycin,linezolid,moxifloxacin,multidrug resistant tuberculosis,outpatient,patient,pipeline,pyrazinamide,rifampicin,risk,society,sputum,therapy,tuberculin,tuberculosis,world health organization",s382,{Cough cough: An case of MDRTB in CT},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l71878217 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=08848734{\&}id=doi:{\&}atitle=cough+cough{\%}3a+an+case+of+mdrtb+in+ct{\&}stitle=j.+gen.+intern.+med.{\&}title=journal+of+gen,30,2015,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,maybe,brooke,no,mushtaq,allison,mushtaq_2,no,md_2.csv,cant find article,NA,NA,no,journal

Case description Male patient, 6 years old, had liver transplant 5 and half years ago due to biliary atresia. Patient was using tacrolimus 1mg q.12hours. This patient started to have pain in left foot and ankle and had one episode of fever 3 days before hospital admission. Physical Examination showed weight 17kg, height 109cm, temperature 36,4Â°C, with pain, swelling and heat in the left ankle, without other clinical signs. Initial tests: hemoglobin 11,7g/dL hematocrit 36.4{\%}, leukocyte count 17600/uL (7{\%} banded neutrophils, 70{\%} segmented neutrophils, 2{\%} eosinophils, basophils 1{\%}, 13{\%} lymphocytes, 7{\%} monocytes) Câreactive protein 170,88mg/L.

1361,yes,bakour2015,article,"AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and the mechanisms of carbapenem and colistin resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates in an Algerian hospital. RESULTS: Twelve isolates were collected between October 2013 and March 2014. All isolates were resistant to almost all antibiotics tested with a high-level resistance to imipenem (minimum inhibitory concentrations [MICs] {\textgreater}32 mg/L) with one strain showing resistance to colistin (MIC=16 mg/L). The results of the modified Hodge test and the modified Carba NP test were positive for all isolates. Besides, the activity of beta-lactamases was inhibited by EDTA in only two isolates. All the 12 isolates contained the naturally occurring blaOXA-51-like gene. Ten of them harbored the OXA beta-lactamases: blaOXA-23 (six isolates) and blaOXA-24 (four isolates) genes, while two isolates were positive for blaNDM-1 gene. The colistin-resistant isolate producing OXA-24 enzyme harbored a single mutation in the pmrB gene. Multilocus sequence typing demonstrated that the 12 isolates belonged to 2 clones: 10 to ST2 and 2 to ST85.

Methods: Antimicrobial susceptibility was studied by Etest. Genes involved in quinolone, ceftriaxone and multidrug resistance were amplified by PCR and sequenced in both directions. The isolates were typed by N. gonorrhoeae multi-antigen sequence typing (NG-MAST). Results: The two isolates had the same MDR profile, showing resistance to penicillin (MIC 0.094 mg/L; $\beta$-lactamase negative), ceftriaxone (MIC 1.5 mg/L), cefixime (MIC 1.5 mg/L), cefotaxime (MIC 1 mg/L), ciprofloxacin (MIC {\textgreater}32 mg/L) and tetracycline (MIC 1.5 mg/L). NG-MAST showed that both isolates belonged to sequence type (ST) 1407 (porB-908 and tbpB-110). Ciprofloxacin resistance was due to amino acid substitutions in GyrA (S91F and D95G) and ParC (S87R). An A deletion in the promoter of the MtrCDE efflux pump (mtrR) was detected. No changes were detected in the pilQ gene. The outer membrane protein PorB showed two substitutions at G120K and A121N. An L421P substitution was observed in the PBP1A (ponA) sequence. The sequence of PBP2 (penA) showed a mosaic structure related to genotype XXXIV with a single additional amino acid substitution (A501P). This genotype was identical to a recently described French isolate (F89). Conclusions: This is the first reported case of high-level extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant N. gonorrhoeae transmission. The molecular typing and MDR genotype suggest possible European spread of this strain, highlighting the need for surveillance and the importance of testing the susceptibility of N. gonorrhoeae to extended-spectrum cephalosporins. {\textcopyright} The Author 2012.

21958,yes,vonthomsen2011,article,"Introduction: Resistance to carbapenems in Gram-negative Bacteria is increasing worldwide. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistance can be mediated by production of metallo-$\alpha$-lactamases (MBL). MBLs are able to hydrolyse penicillins, cephalosporines, and even carbapenems, but not aztreonam. In Germany members of the Verona integron-encoded (VIM) family of MBLs have been reported most frequently. Here we report the detection of an IMP-13-type MBL (IMP for âactive on imipenemâ) in two clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa at a university hospital in northern Germany. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of IMP-13-producing organisms from clinical specimens in Germany. Case report: Two P. aeruginosa strains were isolated from clinical samples in February and March 2010, respectively. One Isolate was detected in the urine from a 70-year old male patient with a neurogenic disturbance of bladder and rectum. The patient was admitted to our hospital for surgical treatment of a sacral decubital ulcer. A second P. aeruginosa isolate was found in an inguinal wound swab from a 61-year old male patient who was admitted to hospital because of a type B dissection of the aorta. Both patients received multiple antibiotics before detection of the IMP-producing P. aeruginosa. More over, both patients developed Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea during their stay at hospital. Bacterial isolates were cultivated and identified by standard microbiological procedures. Susceptibility testing was done by the Vitek2 automated system. Production of MBL was confirmed by Etest and PCR from whole cell lysates. Amplified PCR-products were sequenced and analyzed using the BLAST algorithm. The MICs for both P. aeruginosa isolates were (isolate 1/isolate2, [â¥g/ml]): piperacillin/tazobactam â¥ 128/â¥128, ceftazidime â¥64/â¥64, imipenem 8/â¥16, meropenem 4/â¥16. The production of an MBL was confirmed by Etest phenotypically. Sequencing of a 661 bp fragment (isolate 1) and a 622 bp fragment (isolate 2), respectively, revealed an IMP-13-type MBL in both isolates. Discussion: Although IMP-13 has been detected in isolates from other countries like Italy, Argentina or Austria, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of detection of IMP-13 in clinical isolates from Germany so far. This report underscores the sustaining spread of multidrug-resistant bacteria producing broad-spectrum beta-lactamases.

Emerging antimicrobial drug resistance among bacterial pathogens causing BSI can hinder optimal treatment and patient management decisions. In order to encourage the prudent use of appropriate antibiotics in our pediatric population at Children's Medical Center Hospital, Tehran, Iran, we studied the frequency and antibiogram patterns of blood culture isolates from January 2001 to December 2005. Of 25,223 blood cultures examined in this investigation, 2581 (10.23{\%}) were positive for bacterial growth. The frequency of gram-positive bacteria isolated was 47.5{\%} (1228 of 2581) and that for gram-negatives was 52.5{\%} (1353 of 2581). The rates of oxacillin (methicillin) resistance for S. aureus and coagulasenegative staphylococci (CoNS) were 86{\%} and 89{\%}, respectively. About 45{\%} of S. pneumoniae were resistant to trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole and approximately 73{\%} to penicillin. Among the gram-negative isolates, P. aeruginosa was most frequently isolated, representing 943 (36.7{\%}) over 5 years. In addition, this pathogen showed extremely high rates of antimicrobial resistance. There were notable differences in the sequence of the five most common organisms isolated from blood cultures, which can help set priorities for focused infection control efforts.

Preliminary in vitro studies have shown that H. pylori is highly susceptible to rifabutin. In this study resistance to rifabutin and its structurally related antibiotic, rifampin was assessed. Methods: One hundred H. pylori isolates from dyspeptic patients were recruited in this study. Bacterial suspensions (MacFarland No. 2) were surface inoculated on Brucella blood agar. Sterile blank disks were deposited on the surface of inoculated plates and 10 $\mu$L volume of rifabutin (0.06 $\mu$g/mL) and rifampin (4 $\mu$g/mL) was introduced into the blank disk. After 3-5 days of microaerobic incubation the inhibition zone diameters (IZDs) were recorded. Results: Among 100 isolates, 6 isolates exhibited IZDs {\textless}20 mm and considered resistant to rifabutin. Resistance to rifampin was found in 13 isolates. Rifabutin and rifampin were considerably effective on the susceptible strains which produced IZDs of 20-60 mm and 20-45 mm, respectively. Only one isolate was resistant to both antibiotics. There was no significant difference between resistance rates to rifabutin and rifampin (p value {\textgreater} 0.05). Discussion: Eradication of H. pylori infection is a primary goal in the management of H. pylori-related complications According to our finding, resistance of H. pylori isolates to rifabutin and rifampin is low, 6{\%} and 13{\%}, respectively.

This type of infection is usually fatal. Aeromonas infection is infrequently reported as the cause of ecthyma gangrenosum. Here we show the first case described in Italy of Aeromonas hydrophila ecthyma gangrenosum in the lower extremities in an immunocompetent diabetic without bacteraemia. A 63-year-old obese diabetic male was admitted with an ulcer on his left leg, oedema, pain and fever.

The patient, questioned again, stated that a few days before he had worked in a well near his house without taking precautions. We conclude that early diagnosis and suitable antibiotic therapy are important for the management of ecthyma gangrenosum. The typical presentation of soft tissue infection of A. hydrophila should mimic a Gram-positive infection, which may result in a delay in administration of appropriate antibiotics.

The results of a comparative phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that the isolates belonged to the genus Nocardia. Phenotypic and molecular analyses were performed on the clinical isolates. Traditional phenotypic analyses included morphological, biochemical/physiological, chemotaxonomic and antimicrobial susceptibility profiling. Molecular studies included 1441-bp 16S rRNA and 1246-bp gyrB gene sequence analyses, as well as DNA-DNA hybridizations. Biochemical analysis failed to differentiate the putative novel species from its phylogenetic neighbours; however, molecular studies were able to distinguish the patient strains and confirm them as members of a single species. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, similarity between the isolates and their closest relatives (type strains of Nocardia araoensis, N. arthritidis, N. beijingensis and N. niwae) was {\textless}/=99.3 {\%}. Analysis of partial gyrB gene sequences showed 98-99.7 {\%} relatedness among the isolates. Nocardia lijiangensis and N. xishanensis were the closest related species to the isolates based on gyrB gene sequence analysis, and their type strains showed 95.7 and 95.3 {\%} similarity, respectively, to strain W9988(T).

521,yes,ali2014,article,"INTRODUCTION Acinetobacter baumannii is usually associated with respiratory tract, urinary tract and bloodstream infections. Recent reports suggest that it is increasingly causing skin and soft tissue infections. It is also evolving as a multidrug resistant organism that can be difficult to treat. We present a fatal case of multidrug resistant A. baumannii soft tissue infection and review of relevant literature. PRESENTATION OF CASE A 41 year old morbidly obese man, with history of alcoholic liver disease presented with left superficial pre-tibial abrasions and cellulitis caused by multidrug resistant (MDR) A. baumannii. In spite of early antibiotic administration he developed extensive myositis and fat necrosis requiring extensive and multiple surgical debridements. He deteriorated despite appropriate antibiotic therapy and multiple surgical interventions with development of multi-organ failure and died. DISCUSSION Managing Acinetobacter infections remains difficult due to the array of resistance and the pathogens ability to develop new and ongoing resistance. The early diagnosis of necrotizing soft tissue infection may be challenging, but the key to successful management of patients with necrotizing soft tissue infection are early recognition and complete surgical debridement. CONCLUSION A. baumannii is emerging as an important cause of severe, life-threatening soft tissue infections. Multidrug resistant A. baumannii soft tissue infections may carry a high mortality in spite of early and aggressive treatment.

20713,yes,thacker2014a,article,"Background: Infection or colonization with multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) is associated with high mortality and morbidity. Knowledge of MDRO colonization may help in planning empirical antibiotic approach in neutropenic patients, which is known to improve patient outcomes. While routine cultures are positive and may help direct antibiotic therapy in only up to 15{\%} neutropenic patients, surveillance cultures are positive in more than 90{\%} of cancer patients. Aims: To assess the rate of MDRO carrier status at presentation and rate of conversion to MDRO during the treatment. Materials And Methods: Rectal swabs of all the outpatients presenting to pediatric oncology unit were sent within 7 days from date of registration from January 2014 to December 2014. Furthermore, stool cultures/rectal swabs of all patients who got directly admitted to the pediatric ward at presentation were sent within 24 h. Repeat rectal swabs were sent again for patients from this cohort when they got readmitted to the ward at least 15 days after last discharge or when clinically indicated. Results: Baseline surveillance rectal swabs were sent for 618 patients, which included 528 children with hematological malignancies and 90 children with solid tumors. Forty-five (7.3{\%}) showed no growth. Of the remaining 573, 197 (34.4{\%}) patients were colonized by two organisms and 30 (5.2{\%}) by three organisms. Three hundred and thirty-four (58.4{\%}) showed extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) Enterobacteriaceae, of which 165 (49.5{\%}) were ESBL sensitive to beta-lactam with beta-lactamase inhibitors combinations and 169 (50.5{\%}) were resistant to combinations. One hundred and sixteen (20.2{\%}) were carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and 65 (11.4{\%}) had vancomycin-resistant enterococci in baseline cultures. Only 63 (21{\%}) patients were colonized by a sensitive organism in their baseline surveillance cultures. Morbidity (Intensive Care Unit stay) and mortality was higher in patients colonized by MDR organisms. There was a significant correlation between the place of residence and CRE colonization status with the highest rate (60{\%}) of CRE colonization observed in children from East India. The repeat cultures showed the further conversion of sensitive isolates to MDRO in 80{\%} of these children, of which 40{\%} each converted from non-ESBL and non-CRE to ESBL and CRE, respectively. Conclusion: This is the first study illustrating the alarming high prevalence of community-acquired MDRO colonization, especially CRE, which has grave implications for therapy for children with cancer potentially compromising delivery of aggressive chemotherapy and affecting outcomes. This incidence further increases during the course of treatment. Knowing the baseline colonization also guides us for the planning of chemotherapy as well as antibiotic approach and infection control strategies. Local antibiotics stewardship including education of the healthcare workers as well as national level interventions to prevent antibiotic misuse in the community is critical to minimize this problem.",N Thacker and N Pereira and S D Banavali and G Narula and T Vora and G Chinnaswamy and M Prasad and R Kelkar and S Biswas and B Arora,"1998-4774

11115,maybe,kresken2012a,article,"Background: The Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Programme of the Paul-Ehrlich-Society is a sentinel system designed to monitor the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance (R) in bacterial pathogens of public health importance in humans at regular intervals via a network of microbiology laboratories located in Austria, all regions of Germany, and Switzerland. Here we report on the trends of R to penicillin (PEN) and macrolides (erythromycin, ERY) in Streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp), oxacillin (OXA) in Staphylococcus aureus (Sa), vancomycin (VAN) in Enterococcus faecalis (Efs) and E. faecium (Efm) as well as fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, CIP), 3rd generation cephalosporins (cefotaxime/ceftazidime, CTX/CAZ), piperacillin-tazobactam (P/T) and carbapenems (meropenem, MEM) in Escherichia coli (Ec), Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) among clinical isolates obtained from patients with healthcare-associated infections in Germany. Methods: Susceptibility data of isolates collected in 21, 20, 21, 22, 21 and 21 laboratories that participated in six surveillance studies conducted in 1995, 1998, 2001, 2004, 2007, and 2010, respectively, were analysed. MICs of antimicrobial agents were determined by the broth microdilution procedure according to the standard DIN EN ISO and interpreted by EUCAST criteria. Results: A total of 16,744 isolates primarily recovered from wounds (27{\%}), urine (21{\%}), respiratory specimens (20{\%}), and blood (9{\%}) were tested. There were 3,993 (24{\%}) ICU isolates, 10,387 (62{\%}) non-ICU isolates from hospitalised patients, 2,288 (14{\%}) isolates from outpatients, and 76 (0.04{\%}) isolates of unknown origin. Sp were included in 2001 for the first time. Reduced susceptibility to PEN and ERY among pneumococci was observed in 91.9{\%} and 84.6{\%} in 2001, 93.8{\%} and 78.9{\%} in 2004, 89.4{\%} and 84.5{\%} in 2007 and 84.3{\%} and 83.0{\%} in 2010, respectively, while the proportion of PEN-R strains was {\textless}1{\%} in all yrs. R to OXA in Sa steadily increased from 8{\%} in 1995 to 21.7{\%} in 2007, but then dropped to 17.9{\%} in 2010. R to VAN was rare ({\textless}0.5{\%}) in Efs, but increased in Efm from appr. 5{\%} (until 2001) to 12-15{\%} (after 2001). The proportion of Ec and Kp isolates with R to CTX, P/T and CIP increased from 1.2{\%}, 1.4{\%} and 6{\%} and 2.1{\%}, 2.1{\%} and 4.2{\%}, respectively, in 1995 to 18.2{\%}, 7.1{\%} and 33.1{\%}, and 17.9{\%}, 13{\%} and 19.1{\%}, respectively, in 2010. In contrast, R to MEM was lacking in Ec and also rare (max. 0.5{\%}) in Kp until 2007, but increased to 1.5{\%} in 2010. In Pa, the prevalence of R to CAZ, P/T, MEM, and CIP was 5.8{\%}, 7.7{\%}, 2.2{\%}, and 17.8{\%}, respectively, in 1995 compared to 17.1{\%}, 21{\%}, 10.5{\%}, and 21.5{\%}, respectively, in 2010. Conclusion: The data provide evidence that the occurrence of R to OXA in Sa (i.e. MRSA) and VAN in Efm seems to have stabilized, while increasing trends of R to important antimicrobial classes have been observed in major Gram-neg. pathogens.

13653,yes,medell2014,article,"INTRODUCTION: Enterococcus spp is currently considered as one of the most important nosocomial pathogens . The antibiotic resistance of this group of bacteria is a particularly important problem in health centers. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the antibiotic resistance of 50 Enterococcus spp strains isolated from hospitalized patients clinical samples. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional descriptive observational study in 50 clinical isolates of Enterococcus spp. Only one isolate per patient was analyzed . The identification and antibiotic susceptibility were studied by conventional and automated methods . The phenotypic analysis of glycopeptide resistance mechanisms was performed as recommended by the Spanish Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases . RESULTS: Of 50 isolates obtained from clinical samples, 30 ( 60.0{\%}) belonged to Enterococcus faecalis and 20 (40.0 {\%}) to Enterococcus faecium . The global resistance expressed by this genre was as follows: Ampicillin, 38/50 ( 76.0{\%}); high-level gentamicin, 33/50 ( 66.0{\%}); high-level streptomycin, 34/50 (68.0 {\%}) ; ciprofloxacin, 26/50 (52.0 {\%}); linezolid, 4/50 (8.0 {\%}); teicoplanin, 17/50 ( 34.0{\%}); vancomycin, 25/50 (50.0 {\%}); minocycline, 31/50 ( 62.0{\%}); tetracycline, 34/50 (68.0 {\%}); nitrofurantoin, 9/50 ( 18.0{\%}). As regards glycopeptides, 25/50 (50.0{\%}) showed a Van A mechanism and 10/50 (20.0 {\%}) a Van B mechanism . CONCLUSIONS: The isolates obtained at Hospital Hermanos Ameijeiras showed higher resistance rates than those reported in the consulted literature. The high percentage of vancomycin-resistant strains might have influenced the development of other Gram-positive bacteria resistant to this drug.

22197,maybe,wang2011i,article,"Objectives: To well understand the multilevel molecular characterization of extended-spectrum b-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae causing pneumonia. Methods: A total of 17 and 25 nonduplicate E.coli and K.pneumoniae isolated from 42 patients with pneumonia were characterized in a prospective study in eight hospitals located in seven geographical areas of China during April 2007 to May 2008. In-vitro susceptibilities of these isolates to 21 antimicrobial agents and the ESBL phenotype confirmation test as well as the genetic relationship between isolates were determined by standard method and multilocus sequence typing(MLST). blaESBL types and their genetic environment were analysed by PCR and sequencing. Applying southern blotting to locate blaESBL. Plasmids encoding blaESBL were also classified according to their incompatibility group by a PCR-based replicon-typing scheme. Results: MLST analysis showed the 42 isolates were genetically diverse, no predominant clone was identified. Fourteen strains of E.coli and fifteen strains of K. pneumoniae were confirmed as ESBL producers. The most dominant blaESBL was CTX-M-14(n = 14), followed by SHV-1, SHV-2, SHV- 11, CTX-M-15, CTX-M-65, CTXM-24, CTX-M-3, SHV-12, SHV-26, and SHV- 28.An IS element named ISEcp1, linkage with blaCTX-M-14 and blaCTX-M- 65 was detected in all strains carrying this blaESBL. It is noteworthy that ISEcp1, in one E.coli strain originated from patients with pneumonia coupled with systemic lupus erythematosus and herpes zoster from Jiangxi province was disrupted by IS10 at the middle of ISEcp1, but leaving intact promoter region, which is first found in China. In spite of identical promoter regions of blaCTX-M-14, the range of MICs to ceftazidime among those strains was significantly different, which suggested other mechanisms were involved in the different resistance levels. A truncated IS903 element was observed in six strains contained blaCTX-M-14. ISEcp1 has also been observed upstream of blaCTX-M-3. CTX-M-15 was characterized by the presence of RECF other than ISEcp1. In upstream of blaSHV the RECF which was preceded by IS26, ISEcp1 and other chromosome genes was detected. All the 13 blaSHV-producing strains were found a DEOR transcriptional regulator protein gene at downstream. Characterization of hybridization showed all the plasmids encoding CTX-M or SHV were similar in size except four strains which were also hybridized with larger or smaller plasmids. blaCTX-M were highly associated with IncFIB, IncX, IncI1, by contrast blaSHV were relevant to IncN,IncI1, IncX. Conclusion: The results reveal the high rate of blaESBL, predominantly blaCTX-M-14, located on different plasmids harboured by genotypically different E.coli and K.pneumoniae strains causing pneumonia. Gene arrangement in the blaCTX-M neighbourhood is highly conserved, but the genetic environment of blaSHV is diversity, which suggests complexity in dissemination of ESBL in E.coli and K.pneumoniae causing pneumonia, and further studies should be carried out.",X R Wang and J C Chen and Y Kang and Z C Gao,1323-7799,Respirology,"Asian,China,Escherichia coli,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Southern blotting,antiinfective agent,ceftazidime,clone,environment,extended spectrum beta lactamase,gene,herpes zoster,hospital,human,hybridization,in vitro study,molecular phylogeny,multilocus sequence typing,patient,penicillinase,phenotype,plasmid,pneumonia,promoter region,prospective study,regulator protein,replicon,society,systemic lupus erythematosus",58,{Molecular characterization of plasmid-mediated esbl and their genetic environment in escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from patients with pneumonia from china},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l70575903 http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1400-1843.2011.02071.x http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=13237799{\&}id=doi:10.1111{\%}2fj.1400-1843.2011.02071.x{\&}atitle=m,16,2011,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,maybe,allison,maybe,brooke,brooke,mushtaq_2,no,md_2.csv,cant find,NA,NA,no,journal

Detection and investigation of treatment failures is a crucial component of the World Health Organisation's response to this challenge. We report the cases of two homosexual men, both treated for pharyngeal NG with 500mg intramuscular ceftriaxone, in whom a test of cure 1 week after treatment showed persisting infection. Both men denied further sexual activity. In the first case, treatment failure was confirmed, since the isolates before and after treatment were identical by auxotype, antibiogram, multilocus sequence type (MLST) and multi-antigen sequence type (NG-MAST). In the second case, the MLSTs before and after treatment were identical, but NG-MAST results were similar but not indistinguishable. These cases underline the importance of test-of-cure and molecular investigations in identifying treatment failure, but also highlight the complexity of distinguishing treatment failure from reinfection when relying on highly variable molecular targets that may be subject to drug pressure.",P J Read and E A Limnios and A McNulty and D Whiley and M M Lahra,"1448-5028 (print)

17797,yes,rokosz2006,article,"The aim of presented study was to detect MBL-positive strains in a group of clinical carbapenem-resistant strains isolated from inpatients and outpatients during last four years. From the beginning of November 2001 to the end of October 2005, one hundred and four strains resistant to carbapenem antibiotics--imipenem and meropenem were cultured from clinical samples obtained from patients of the Infant Jesus Clinical Hospital Centre for Trauma Treatment in Warsaw and from patients of outpatient clinics. Strains were identified and their susceptibility to antibacterial agents was determined in the automatic ATB Expression system (bioM{\'{e}}rieux). Resistance to imipenem and meropenem was confirmed with a disc diffusion method. Production of metallo-beta-lactamases (MBL) was examined with the use of Etest MBL (AB Biodisk, Sweden), and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) by means of following procedures: DDST and / or DD (four variants) (Oxoid Ltd., England). MBL-positive strains (36) were cultured in cases of infections in adult patients (35 strains) and in a child (1 strain). Majority of strains belonged to the species P. aeruginosa (27), several strains - to the species P. putida (6) and remaining strains--to P. stutzeri, A. xylosoxidans, and E. cloacae (1 strain of each species). Four strains were producers of MBL-type and ESBL-type beta-lactamases. According to our knowledge and accessible literature described strains (except one paediatric strain) are the first MBL-positive strains isolated from adult hospitalized patients and adult ambulatory patients in Poland. Additionally, MBL-positive E. cloacae strain is probably the first MBL producer isolated in Poland, which belongs to the group of enteric rods. MBL-producing strains of Gram-negative rods, detected by phenotypic Etest MBL method, will be verified with genetic procedures.",A Rokosz and A Sawicka-Grzelak and M Luczak,"0025-8601 (print)

Methods: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by microdilution method according to CLSI guidelines. Resistance genes were characterized by PCR, DNA microarray (Check-points CT102) and sequencing. The genetic background of blaNDM-1 was analysed by PCR mapping. Transferability of beta-lactam resistance was tested by broth mating-out assays and transformation of plasmids. Typing of the Ab strain was performed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Results: A multidrug and carbapenem-resistant Ab isolate 11314 was recovered from a rectal swab specimen of a 20-year old patient in vegetative state transferred from Algeria to Belgium after severe traffic injury. The isolate was highly resistant to all beta-lactams including meropenem and imipenem (MIC â¥ 32 mg/L), aminoglycosides (gentamicin, tobramycin and amikacin), and quinolone (ciprofloxacin) but it remained susceptible to colistin (MIC = 0.5 mg/L), and tigecycline (MIC {\textless} 0.25 mg/L). PCR/sequencing and Check-points micro-array revealed the presence of blaNDM-1 only. A single not typeable plasmid of 174 kb was detected but transfer experiments failed to demonstrate the presence of any carbapenem-resistant trait, suggesting that the blaNDM-1 was located on the chromosome. PCR-mapping revealed that blaNDM-1 was located between two direct repeat of ISAba125 element in a transposon similar to the one reported in Ab 161/07 isolated in Germany (Pfeifer et al. JAC 2011; Accession Nr HQ857107). By MLST, Ab 11314 presented an allele profile 1-3-3-2-2-7-3 corresponding to sequence type (ST) 92 (Bartual et al., JCM 2005), a ST already described in many different regions of the world (mostly in association with OXA-23-producing Ab strains). Sequencing analysis of the intrinsic blaOXA-51-like and blaADC genes showed that this strain harboured the blaOXA-64 and the blaADC-26, neither of which were preceded by ISAba1 nor ISAba125. Conclusions: Here, we report for the first time an A. baumanniiproducing NDM-1 isolated in Belgium belonging to ST92. The blaNDM-1 gene was located in a composite transposon structure composed of two copies of the insertion sequence ISAba125, very similar to the structure described for another A. baumannii strain (Ab 161/07) from Germany.",R {Rezende De Castro} and P Bogaerts and S Roisin and A Deplano and T Huang and M Hallin and O Denis and Y Glupczynski,1198-743x,Clinical Microbiology and Infection,"Acinetobacter baumannii,Algeria,Belgium,DNA,DNA microarray,Germany,allele,amikacin,aminoglycoside,antibiotic resistance,antibiotic sensitivity,assay,beta lactam,carbapenem,chromosome,ciprofloxacin,colistin,environment,gene,gene insertion sequence,gentamicin,human,imipenem,infection,injury,mating,meropenem,microbiology,multilocus sequence typing,patient,persistent vegetative state,plasmid,quinolone,tigecycline,tobramycin,traffic,transposon",368,{First NDM-1-producing Acinetobacter baumannii in Belgium},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l70823131 http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-0691.2012.03802.x http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=1198743x{\&}id=doi:10.1111{\%}2fj.1469-0691.2012.03802.x{\&}atitle=f,18,2012,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,yes,erica,no,mushtaq,zach,mushtaq_2,yes,md_2.csv,NA,NA,md_2_2.mex,yes,journal
261,yes,ahmed-bentley2013,article,"Overseas travel, as a risk factor for the acquisition of infections due to antimicrobial-resistant organisms, has recently been linked to carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacteria. Multiresistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter baumannii strains were isolated from a wound of a Canadian patient with a recent history of hospitalization in India. This resulted in the initiation of outbreak management that included surveillance cultures. Epidemiological and molecular investigations showed that NDM-1-producing K. pneumoniae ST16 and OXA-23-producing A. baumannii ST10 strains were transmitted to 5 other patients, resulting in the colonization of 4 patients and the death of 1 patient due to septic shock caused by the OXA-23-producing A. baumannii strain. The high rate of false positivity of the screening cultures resulted in additional workloads and increased costs for infection control and clinical laboratory work. We believe that this is the first report of an infection with carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacteria resulting in death attributed to a patient with recent foreign hospitalization. We recommend routine rectal and wound screening for colonization with multiresistant bacteria for patients who have recently been admitted to hospitals outside Canada.

Sputa were obtained from three different categories of hospitals (district, regional and national) in Chad. All examined sputa were smear-positive and were investigated by culture and drug resistance testing for first-line antituberculosis drugs. From 232 sputa positive for acid-fast bacilli, 135 isolates of M. tuberculosis from different patients (46 women, 89 men, mean age 34 years) were analyzed. All the patients except one corresponded to new cases of tuberculosis. In total, 27 out of 135 isolates (20{\%}) were resistant to at least one major antituberculosis drug. Resistance to isoniazid was the most frequent resistance observed, with 18 isolates (13{\%}) presenting at least this resistance. Three isolates (2.2{\%}) were resistant to isoniazid and rifampicin (multidrug resistance MDR) including one isolate being concomitantly resistant to streptomycin and ethambutol. The resistance rate differed in relation to the category of the hospital; the most important resistance rate was observed in regional hospitals (33{\%}), while it was 16{\%} and 14{\%} in the national and district hospitals, respectively.

A total of 28 rectal swabs and 28 skin swabs from the patients, 12 skin swabs from the staff giving care to the patients, 15 skin swabs from the mothers of the patients and 96 environmental samples from the pediatric unit were screened. Antibiotic susceptibilities were tested and the resistance genotypes were determined. Molecular typing of the isolates was performed using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Apart from the first case, 13 more VRE isolates, one being a clinical isolate from the urine of a patient and 12 isolates from the screening samples (8 rectal swabs, one skin swab and three swabs from patients' beds) were obtained. All of the isolates were identified as Enterococcus faecium with similar antibiotic susceptibility patterns. VanA gene was present in all of the isolates. PFGE demonstrated two major clones and five clones closely related with the major ones. This was the first VRE isolation and colonization reported in our region. The isolates belonged to more than one clone.

22035,maybe,wahid2013,article,"Background: Shigellosis is a significant public health concern and is one of the major diarrhoeal diseases in developed and developing countries including Bangladesh. Although shigellosis is generally self-limiting, patients with diarrhea frequently receive empiric ciprofloxacin treatment. We report here the serogroup distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of Shigella isolated from rural and urban areas of Bangladesh. Methods: Stool samples were collected from patients attending treatment centers of icddr,b during January 2010 to December 2012 and processed by standard methods. Shigella spp. were isolated and characterized using standard microbiological and molecular methods. Antibiotic susceptibility patter was done by disc-diffusion using the CLSI guidelines. Results: In total, 1912 (19.05{\%}) isolates were confirmed as Shigella spp. from 10,036 diarrhoeal patients in Dhaka and 478 (10.58{\%}) isolates from 4,516 patients in Mirzapur, Bangladesh. S. flexneri was the predominant in both Dhaka (47.75{\%}) and Mirzapur (50.21{\%}). S. sonnei was the second predominant serogroup and the prevalence was 25.36{\%} and 32.01{\%} in Dhaka and Mirzapur, respectively, followed by S. boydii (19.29{\%} and 14.65{\%}, respectively) and S. dysenteriae (4.65{\%} and 3.01{\%}, respectively). Only 3{\%} of strains isolated in Dhaka did not agglutinate with any commercially available anitisera but showed Shigella like biochemical reactions which are termed as Shigella-like organisms. Of the isolates, 5.87{\%} of the strains showed resistance to mecillinam irrespective of their resistance to ampicillin, co-trimoxazole, nalidixic acid, species, and location, and resistance to ciprofloxacin was 70{\%} and 35{\%} in Dhaka and Mirzapur, respectively. Resistance to â¥3 drugs was found in more than 90{\%} of the strains in both locations. The emergence of ciprofloxacin resistance was first detected in S. dysenteriae in 2003 and in S. flexneri and S. boydii were in 2007 and in 2008, respectively. Since its emergence, ciprofloxacin- resistant strains are rapidly increasing and spread out among Shigella species, commonly among S. sonnei and S. flexneri. The rapid increase of resistance may be due to indiscriminate use of antibiotics and mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer have also contributed a lot to the emergence and diffusion of multi-drug resistance in Shigella spp. Conclusions: Emergence of ciprofloxacin resistant Shigella species in both rural and urban areas of Bangladesh is disturbing as treatment options in our geographic area and is alarming and likely to emerge as a threat to public health. A close monitoring of shifts in serogroup distribution and antibiotic resistance is required to guide clinicians for treatment of shigellosis.",S U H Wahid and A I M Ud-Din and H A Latif and K A Talukder,1438-4221,International Journal of Medical Microbiology,"Bangladesh,Shigella,ampicillin,antibiotic agent,antibiotic resistance,antibiotic sensitivity,ciprofloxacin,cotrimoxazole,developing country,diarrhea,diffusion,diseases,disk diffusion,drug resistance,horizontal gene transfer,human,hygiene,mecillinam,microbiology,monitoring,nalidixic acid,patient,prevalence,public health,quinolone derivative,shigellosis,society,species,urban area",45,{Emergence of resistance to fluoroquinolones among Shigella spp. in rural and urban areas of Bangladesh during 2010-12},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l71206489 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmm.2013.08.004 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=14384221{\&}id=doi:10.1016{\%}2fj.ijmm.2013.08.004{\&}atitle=emergence+of+,303,2013,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,yes,erica,maybe,mushtaq,mushtaq,mushtaq_2,no,md_2.csv,cant find pdf,NA,NA,no,journal

This study was undertaken to identify and characterise mutations in the gyrA and parC genes of N. gonorrhoeae resistant to six different quinolone antibiotics. In total, 64 N. gonorrhoeae clinical isolates were obtained during 2007-2009 from patients attending sexually transmitted diseases clinics (New Delhi, 35; Pune, 16; Mumbai, 6; Hyderabad, 6; and Nagpur, 1). Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by Etest and mutation patterns in gyrA and parC were determined by sequencing analysis. All strains showed varying resistance to different quinolone analogues, ranging from 17.2{\%} (gatifloxacin) to 98.4{\%} (ofloxacin and norfloxacin). Sequencing of gyrA and parC revealed that 100{\%} of strains showed mutations in gyrA and 46.9{\%} showed mutations both in gyrA and parC. All strains showed single or double mutations at Ser-91--{\textgreater}Phe, Ser-91--{\textgreater}Thr and Asp-95--{\textgreater}Gly/Asn in gyrA and at Glu-91--{\textgreater}Gly in parC. Asp-95--{\textgreater}Asn mutation was the most prevalent in strains isolated from New Delhi, whilst Asp-95--{\textgreater}Gly was prevalent in strains isolated from Pune. Strains were categorised into eight different mutation patterns. Resistant strains with high minimum inhibitory concentrations ({\textgreater}/=8 mug/mL) showed mutations both in gyrA and parC. The difference in the proportion of strains showing mutations in gyrA and parC was found to be significant (P{\textless}0.001).

12287,maybe,liu2011e,article,"Aim To monitor the resistance to metronidazole, clarithromycin, Levofl oxacin, furazolidone and amoxicillin of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) strains in Jiangxi Province. Method The tissue samples were collected by gastroscope biopsy from the outpatients and inpatients with gastric diseases. 121 tissue samples cultured in microaerobic condition were identified as typical H. pylori strains by biochemical and slice checking methods. E-test method was used to measure the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of these identified H. pylori strains resistant to metronidazole, clarithromycin, Levofloxacin and amoxicillin. Drug sensitivity tests of furazolidone was performed by means of Kirby-Bane. Result Among 121 H. pylori strains, the resistance rate to metronidazole was 72.70{\%} (88/121), and the MIC ranged from 0.016 mg/L to beyond 256 mg/L; to clarithromycin, 14.88{\%} (18/121), MIC ranged from 0.016 mg/L to beyond 256 mg/L; to Levofloxacin, 14.05{\%} (17/121), MIC from 0.02 mg/L to beyond 256 mg/L; amoxicillin 0.83{\%} (1/121), MIC from 0.016 mg/L to 2 mg/L; furazolidone 0{\%} (0/121) Conclusion In Jiangxi Province, the resistance rate of H. pylori to metronidazole was the highest (72.70{\%}), and the second was to clarithromycin and Levofloxacin (14.88{\%}, 14.05{\%} respectively).

16225,yes,pearman2006,article,"The first hospital outbreak of a vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) in Western Australia (WA) started in the Royal Perth Hospital in July 2001 and initially involved the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and the Nephrology and Dialysis Units. The outbreak was caused by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) of the vanB genotype. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and plasmid analysis of the isolates demonstrated a single-strain outbreak. Despite the isolation of carriers and implementation of all the additional precautions recommended to control VRE, VREF spread rapidly. Two months after the index patient was detected, the epidemic strain had spread to 22 wards and units and one outpatient unit (Satellite Dialysis). Four patients were infected and 64 were colonized. A Hospital VRE Executive Group, which included the Chief Executive and Directors of Clinical Services and Nursing, was formed to eradicate the outbreak and to prevent the epidemic strain from becoming endemic in the hospital. The WA Department of Health agreed to provide substantial extra funding to enable the hospital to use expensive enhanced infection control practices, as follows.1.Cohorting of all positive and ward contact patients in separate wards with dedicated nursing staff for each cohort.2.All inpatients (ward contacts without known exposure) were screened during a one-week period to identify the total reservoir of VREF carriage. Thirty-nine previously unknown carriers were found.3.Establishment of a dedicated VRE ward-cleaning service for the duration of the outbreak.4.Environmental cultures after terminal cleaning and disinfection to check the efficacy of terminal cleaning after carriers had been discharged.5.Electronic flagging of the medical records of VREF carriers and ward contacts.6.Screening of ward contacts after discharge from hospital.7.Special arrangements for the discharge of geriatric VREF carriers and ward contacts to residential care facilities. Control was handicapped by the slowness of conventional laboratory methods, which took four to five days to identify VRE and allowed environmental contamination and nosocomial transmission to occur before carriers were detected and isolated. A laboratory procedure to make rapid provisional identification of VRE within 30-48 h was developed by performing multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for vanA and vanB genes directly on 24-h selective enrichment broth cultures. On average, four rectal swabs, each collected on separate days, were needed to detect {\textgreater}90{\%} of carriers. In total, 1977 ward contacts were screened after discharge from hospital and 54 (2.73{\%}) were found to be carrying VREF. The electronic labelling and active follow-up of ward contacts resulted in a significant number of carriers being detected who otherwise posed a risk of initiating further outbreaks in hospital if they were re-admitted. The outbreak was terminated after five months and the cost of the enhanced infection control practices was AUD{\$} 2 700 000 ({\pounds}1 000 000). Ongoing control has been facilitated by targeted active surveillance cultures: on admission to high-risk units (ICU, Burns, Nephrology, Haematology, Bone Marrow Transplant Unit), on transfer out of the ICU to other hospital units, by monthly screening of patients regularly attending Dialysis Units, and by opportunistic laboratory screening of inpatient faecal specimens submitted for Clostridium difficile culture and toxin. Vigilance needs to be maintained as the epidemic strain of VREF remains in the Perth community. Ward contacts of the first outbreak have caused small outbreaks in two hospitals, and seven to 19 sporadic new carriers have been detected annually since the first outbreak. The key elements of the VRE control programme are as follows:1.Targeted active surveillance cultures of patients on high-risk hospital units.2.Rapid provisional laboratory identification of VRE by multiplex PCR directly on 24-h selective enrichment broth cultures.3.Contact isolation of known carriers and unscreened ward contacts of outbreaks.4.Electronic flaggi g of medical records of known carriers and unscreened ward contacts of outbreaks.5.Eradication of single-strain (epidemic strain) outbreaks in hospitals by enhanced infection control practices.6.Surveillance typing of VRE isolates from all new carriers in WA to identify epidemic strains and trace their epidemiology.

19120,maybe,shibl2013a,article,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the emergence of NDM-, OXA-48-, and VIM-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: From June to December 2011, we obtained K. pneumoniae isolates with reduced sensitivity to carbapenem identified in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Only non-duplicate clinical and surveillance isolates obtained from inpatients were included. PCR amplification was carried out for the detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase genes (blaCTX-M, blaTEM, blaSHV) and carbapenemase genes (blaKPC, blaVIM, blaIMP, blaNDM, and blaOXA-48). Susceptibility to imipenem, meropenem, amikacin, gentamicin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and colistin was determined. RESULTS: Of the 60K. pneumoniae isolates studied, 45 were from patients in the intensive care unit. Forty-seven isolates harbored blaOXA-48, 12 were positive for blaNDM, and one for blaVIM. No isolate harbored a combination of these resistance genes. No isolate harbored blaKPC or blaIMP. All 37 blaCTX-M-positive isolates belonged to CTX-M group 1, and 29 were positive for a combination of blaCTX-M and blaOXA-48. blaTEM and blaSHV genes were found in 17 and 39 isolates, respectively.

21988,yes,vu-thien2010,article,"Background. Staphylococcus aureus infection in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) is frequent and may be due to colonization by a few pathogenic lineages. Systematic genotyping of all isolates, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) as well as methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is necessary to identify such lineages and follow their evolution in patients. Multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA/VNTR) was used to survey S. aureus clinical isolates in a French paediatric CF centre. Results. During a 30 months period, 108 patients, aged 2 to 21 years, regularly followed up at the centre, provided sputum for culture. From 79 patients, a total of 278 isolates were genotyped by MLVA, resolving into 110 genotypes and 19 clonal complexes (CC) composed of similar or closely related isolates. 71{\%} of the strains were distributed into four main CCs, in term of number of isolates and number of genotypes. Spa (Staphylococcus protein A) typing was performed on representative samples, showing an excellent concordance with MLVA. In 17 patients, strains from two to four different CCs were recovered over time. On six occasions, S. aureus isolates with the same genotype were shared by 2 different patients and they belonged to one of the four main clusters. Methicillin-resistance was observed in 60{\%} of the isolates, 90{\%} of which belonged to the main clonal complexes CC8, CC45 and CC5. In 5 patients, methicillin-resistance of S. aureus isolates was not associated with the mecA gene: for four patients, it was due to overproduction of -lactamase, leading to BOR-SA (borderline S. aureus) isolates, while a strain showing probably a new modified penicillin-binding capacity (MOD-SA) was observed from one patient. Conclusion. Systematic genotyping of S. aureus isolates recovered from sputum of CF children allows a thorough analysis of the strains responsible for sporadic as well as chronic colonization and the follow up of their evolution over time. We show here that more than 70{\%} of these strains belong to 4 major CCs. MSSA as well as MRSA, BOR-SA and MOD-SA isolates can persist over several years, despite antibiotic treatments. {\textcopyright} 2010 Vu-Thien et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",H Vu-Thien and K Hormigos and G Corbineau and B Fauroux and H Corvol and D Moissenet and G Vergnaud and C Pourcel,1471-2180,BMC Microbiol,",Adolescent,Bacterial Typing Techniques,Bacterial/genetics,Child,Cluster Analysis,Cystic Fibrosis/*microbiology,DNA,France,Genotype,Humans,Infant,Longitudinal Studies,Minisatellite Repeats,Preschool,Staphylococcal Infections/*microbiology,Staphylococcus aureus,Staphylococcus aureus/classification/*genetics/iso,Young Adult,adolescent,adult,article,bacterial strain,bacterium isolate,beta lactamase,child,clonal variation,cystic fibrosis,enzyme synthesis,gene cluster,gene locus,genotype,health survey,human,longitudinal study,major clinical study,methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus,meticillin,multiple locus variable number tandem repeat analy,pediatric hospital,penicillin binding protein,penicillin binding protein 2a,penicillin resistance,preschool child,school child,sputum culture,staphylococcus protein A,tandem repeat",24,{Longitudinal survey of Staphylococcus aureus in cystic fibrosis patients using a multiple-locus variable-number of tandem-repeats analysis method},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l358348440 http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2180-10-24 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=14712180{\&}id=doi:10.1186{\%}2f1471-2180-10-24{\&}atitle=longitudinal+surve,10,2010,NA,"from duplicate 1 (longitudinal survey of staphylococcus aureus in cystic fibrosis patients using a multiple-locus variable-number of tandem-repeats analysis method - vu-thien, h; hormigos, k; corbineau, g; fauroux, b; corvol, h; moissenet, d; vergnaud, g; pourcel, c)

9508,maybe,jain2014a,article,"Objectives: Gram-negative bacteria with diverse carbapenemases, including New Delhi metallo-$\beta$-lactamase (NDM) enzymes, have been increasingly recorded in the UK since 2007. We analysed patient data for NDM-positive isolates confirmed by the national reference laboratory from UK laboratories from February 2008 to July 2013. Methods: Isolates resistant to carbapenems and with imipenem MICs reduced â¥8-fold by EDTA were tested by PCR for genes encoding acquired class B carbapenemases. MICs were determined by BSAC agar dilution methodology. When requested by the sender, or when they were members of apparent clusters, NDM-positive isolates were typed by variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) analysis or PFGE. Data provided by the sending laboratories were collated and reviewed. Results: From February 2008 to July 2013 the reference laboratory confirmed 326 NDM-positive isolates from 250 patients, submitted by 83 laboratories. Most (85{\%}, 213/250) patients were already hospitalized when the NDM-positive bacteria were detected, were male (61{\%}, 152/250) and were aged {\textgreater}60 years (58{\%}, 145/250). Travel history was available for only 40{\%} of patients, but 52{\%} (53/101) of these had documented healthcare contact within or travel to the Indian subcontinent. Most NDM-positive isolates (94{\%}, 306/326) were Enterobacteriaceae with just 6{\%} (20/326) non-fermenters; the predominant hosts were Klebsiella spp. (55{\%}, 180/326) and Escherichia coli (25{\%}, 80/326). Almost all NDM-positive isolates were resistant to multiple antibiotic classes, but 90{\%} remained susceptible to colistin. Conclusions: Gram-negative bacteria with NDM carbapenemases are a growing challenge, especially for elderly hospitalized patients, including those with healthcare contact in the Indian subcontinent, and leave few therapeutic options. UK outbreaks remain rare and contained. {\textcopyright} 2014.",A Jain and K L Hopkins and J Turton and M Doumith and R Hill and R Loy and D Meunier and R Pike and D M Livermore and N Woodford,"1460-2091

22750,maybe,wu2006c,article,"From February to June 2003, 111 clinical isolates of Proteus mirabilis were mainly isolated from patients with respiratory or urinary tract infections hospitalized at 3 district hospitals (A, B, C) in central Taiwan. Among them, 34 (30.6{\%}) strains, isolated within 2 hospitals (A and B), exhibited nonsusceptibility to cefotaxime with significant reduction of MIC ({\textgreater} or = 3 log2 dilution) by the effect of clavulanic acid, which confirmed the phenotype of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). These ESBL producers were coresistant to gentamicin, isepamicin, and amikacin, but remained susceptible to ceftazidime (MIC, {\textless} or = 0.5 microg/mL) and meropenem (MIC, {\textless}0.5 microg/mL). By isoelectric focusing analysis, polymerase chain reaction, and nucleotide sequencing, we detected the presence of CTX-M-14 in 33 strains and CTX-M-3 in 6 strains (5 strains harboring both CTX-M-14 and CTX-M-3 enzymes). These beta-lactamase genes can be successfully transferred by the conjugative plasmid. Molecular epidemiology of the 34 ESBL-producing P. mirabilis strains by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis using SfiI restriction enzyme revealed 9 different genotypes, suggesting epidemic clones with intra- and interhospital spread.

14121,yes,mlynarczyk-bonikowska2014,article,"INTRODUCTION: Azithromycin is one of the most commonly used macrolide antibiotics. As other macrolides it inhibits bacterial proteins synthesis by binding with V domene of bacterial 23S rRNA. Resistance to azithromycin can be related to: 1. Mutations in gene encoding 23S rRNA. Significant effect on azithromycin MIC (minimal inhibitory concentration) is not observed when the mutation occurs only in 1 allele. In case of mutations occurring in 4 alleles, more common mutation C2611T is associated with MIC 2-16 mg/L and the second mutation A2059T results in high level resistance to azithromycin MIC {\textgreater} 256 mg/l 2. Over- production of membrane pumps proteins MtrCDE and MacAB, that remove antibiotics from bacterial cells. The mechanism is not able to cause azithromycin resistance itself but coexisting with other mechanisms of resistance can additionally increase MIC. 3. Synthesis of 23S rRNA methylases ErmB, ErmF, ErmC, ErmA. These enzymes cause demethylation of adenine (A2058) in V domain of 23S rRNA. The mechanism was common in the past, but it has been replaced by mutations in in V domain of 23S rRNA. Nowadays 23S rRNA methylases are very rare in N. gonorhoeae. METHODS: Sixty five Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains isolated from patients of the Department of Dermatology and Venereology in Warsaw in the second half of 2012 and first of 2013 were investigated. The strains were cultured on chocolate agar plates in a 5{\%} CO2 atmosphere at 37 degrees C and identified by colony morphology, Gram staining and oxidase reaction, followed by carbohydrate utilization test. Azithromycin susceptibility was determined by E-Tests (bioMerieux). Bacteria were incubated at 37 degrees C in 5{\%} CO2 for 24 h on chocolate agar plates. Tests were performed according to producers recommendations. The results (sensitive or resistant) were interpreted according to EUCAST recommendations. RESULTS: The MIC of azithromycin in investigated strains ranged from 0,064 to 4 mg/L, MIC50 = 0.5 mg/L, MIC90 = 2 mg/L. It was shown that only 38.5{\%} of the strains were sensitive to azithromycin according to EUCAST criteria from 2014 year and 89.3{\%} of the strains were sensitive to azithromycin according to CDC criteria from 2014 year. CONCLUSIONS: The percentage of azithromycin resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains is increasing in Poland and the antibiotic should not be used in monotherapy as gonorrhoea patients. It should only be used in combination with ceftriaxone or cefixime.",B Mlynarczyk-Bonikowska and M Kujawa and G Mlynarczyk and M Malejczyk and S Majewski,"0025-8601 (print)0025-8601",Med Dosw Mikrobiol,"*Drug Resistance, Bacterial/genetics,Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology,Azithromycin/*pharmacology,Humans,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Mutation,Neisseria gonorrhoeae/classification/*drug effects,Poland,RNA, Bacterial/genetics,RNA, Ribosomal, 23S/genetics,Species Specificity",209--214,{[Resistance to azithromycin of Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains isolated in Poland in 2012-2013 years]},NA,66,2014,4-mar,"mlynarczyk-bonikowska, beatakujawa, marlenamlynarczyk, grazynamalejczyk, magdalenamajewski, slawomirenglish abstractjournal articlepolandmed dosw mikrobiol. 2014;66(3-4):209-14.",NA,1/1/14,pol,25804074,yes,erica,yes,nchedo,nchedo,mushtaq,no,md_3.csv,no access,NA,NA,no,journal

A chromosomally encoded homologue in Shewanella algae, qnrA3, has been described. We isolated two qnrA3-positive strains, one of Klebsiella pneumoniae (He96) and one of Kluyvera ascorbata (Kas96), from the feces of an immunocompromised outpatient. The qnrA3 allele was identical to that of S. algae except for 5 nucleotides and differed from qnrA1 by 29 nucleotides affecting three amino acids. The analysis of the qnrA3 genetic environment showed that qnrA3 was inserted downstream from an ISCR1 element at a recombination crossover site described for other resistance genes, including qnrA1, and immediately upstream from IS26, a situation not described before. IS26 preceded an incomplete class 1 integron which contained, among other genes, aac(6')-Ib-cr, another transferable quinolone resistance gene, and the beta-lactamase gene bla(OXA-1/30). The 10-kb fragment encompassing qnrA3 was compared to previously described qnrA1-containing plasmids and multidrug-resistant plasmids; it shares identical sequences with pC15a, pHSH2, pQR1, pQKp311H, and pSAL-1 but with rearrangements, deletions, and mutations. Conjugal transfer of qnrA3 was highly efficient (10(-2)) from K. pneumoniae He96 or K. ascorbata Kas96 to Escherichia coli J53 but less so (10(-5)) from either donor to a clinical strain of Enterobacter cloacae.

5258,maybe,dimopoulos2012,article,"Introduction: Hospital acquired bloodstream infections (HA-BSI) are an important complication of critical illness and emergence of anti-microbial resistance, particularly in some countries like Greece, has been of increasing concern. Hypothesis: Resistant microorganisms predominate in HA-BSIs in Greek ICUs. Methods: Secondary analysis of data collected during EUROBACT study, a large prospective, observational, multicenter study conducted in 162 ICUs of 24 countries worldwide. First episodes of HA-BSI acquired in the ICU or within 48 hours prior to ICU admission were recorded. Results: Twenty nine Greek ICUs contributed 288 episodes of HA-BSIs. Mean age (SD) was 59.5 (17.9) years; mean (SD) SAPS II was 48.1 (14.1) at ICU admission, and SOFA 8.3 (3.8) at HA-BSI onset. The commonest pathogens were Acinetobacter sp (84/329 isolates; 25.5{\%}), Klebsiella sp (23.4{\%}), Pseudomonas sp (12.2{\%}), and Enterococcus sp (7{\%}); 37 (12.8{\%}) episodes were polymicrobial. Among monomicrobial cases (n=251), 184 (73.3{\%}) were Gram-negative (GNB), 46 (18.3{\%}) Gram-positive (GPC), 19 (7.6{\%}) fungal, and 2 (0.8{\%}) anaerobes. Overall, 241 (73.3{\%}) isolates were classified as multidrug resistant (MDR), 155 (47.1{\%}) extensively resistant (XDR), 4 (1.2{\%}) as pan-drug resistant (PDR); 59.5{\%} GNB and 13{\%} enterococci were resistant to carbapenems and glycopeptides, respectively. Carbapenems were the most frequently empirically prescribed antibiotics, while colistin was the most frequently adequate. Overall 28-day all cause mortality was 33.3{\%} (G 33.7{\%}, GPC30.4{\%}, fungi61.9{\%}, polymicrobial18.9{\%}). In the multivariate analysis, factors adversely affecting outcome were higher SOFA at HA-BSI onset ([per point] OR1.188; 95{\%}CI 1.08-1.31, p=0.0006), need for renal support (OR2.75; 95{\%}CI 1.35-5.59, p=0.0053), and for vasopressors/inotropes (OR2.68; CI 1.18-6.12, p=0.02), whereas adequate empiric treatment had a protective effect (OR 0.48; CI 0.24-0.95, p= 0.03).

We analysed auxotrophy of cultured SCVs, their antimicrobial susceptibility profiles and their biofilm-forming capacity. Eight SCV strains were cultivated from six (19 {\%}) patients. All SCVs were coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) with Staphylococcus epidermidis as the predominant species; there was also one Staphylococcus warneri SCV. The SCVs were auxotrophic for haemin, with one strain additionally auxotrophic for menadione. We noted the presence of two phenotypically (differences concerning antimicrobial susceptibility) and genetically distinct SCV strains in one patient, as well as the growth of two genetically related SCVs that differed in terms of their morphology and the type of auxotrophy in another. Seven out of eight SCVs were resistant to meticillin and gentamicin. In addition, antibiotic sensitivity testing revealed three multidrug-resistant SCV-normal-morphology isolate pairs. One S. epidermidis SCV harboured icaADBC genes and was found to be a proficient biofilm producer. This paper highlights the involvement of CNS SCVs in the aetiology of PJIs, including what is believed to be the first report of a S. warneri SCV. These subpopulations must be actively sought in the routine diagnosis of implant-associated infections.

15253,yes,nouvenne2013,article,"Objectives: Carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC) is an emerging multidrug resistant nosocomial pathogen. It may cause epidemic outbreaks of serious systemic infections in hospital in-patients with a high degree of frailty and a large number of comorbidities. Its intrinsic resistance to almost every antibiotic therapy makes these infections particularly difficult to treat, with a documented mortality rate next to 60{\%}. The first epidemic outbreak in Italy was described in 2009,while our hospitalwas involved for the first time in July 2011. The aims of this research were therefore to describe the characteristics of a KPC outbreak in a subacute critical care ward and to assess the effect of sanitary measures (bed isolation vs cohort isolation). Materials and methods: At InternalMedicine and Critical Subacute Care Unit of Parma University Hospital we consecutively studied all patients infected by KPC (133 patients, M 75, F 58, mean age 79Â± 12 years) from August 2011 toMay 2012.Werecordedmain diagnosis, comorbidities, length of hospital stay, outcome, and anatomical district of KPC isolation for all patients. Following Emilia-Romagna Regional Guidelines, all infected patients, all contacts of these patients and all bedridden patients of the same ward were subdued to a rectal tampon for KPC detection every 7 days. FromOctober 2011 to February 2012 we also activated a 14-bed isolation ward applying a staff cohorting management. In the previous and following periodwe instead applied the traditional contact isolation approach. Results: During the first two months of epidemic outbreak with the traditional contact isolation approach we observed 41 new cases (23 in the first month and 18 in the second month). The cases were limited to an average of 8 cases per month (range 3-13) in the following 5 months after the activation of the 14-bed staff cohorting ward. After the restoration of the usual contact isolation measures, we observed a newincrease in incidence rates (respectively 15 and 18 cases in April and May 2012). Mean length of hospital stay of KPC-positive patients was significantly longer than that of other patients admitted to our unit (35 Â± 24 vs 18 Â± 12 days, p {\textless} 0.001). Inmost cases, KPC was isolated in rectal tampon cultures. 29 patients out of 133 (14{\%}) deceased during hospital stay. Most of the deaths were attributable to septic shock and occurred in the first two months of the epidemic outbreak. The most prevalent comorbidities were cardiopathies (84/133 patients, 64{\%}) and COPD (72/133 patients, 54{\%}). Conclusions: KPC infection is quickly emerging as a relevant health issue, especially in elderly frail inpatients with multiple comorbidities. Mortality in our setting has however been lower than that described in the literature.

22993,yes,yang2016g,article,"Multidrug-resistant gram-negative rods are reported worldwide. Carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae have been reported to an increasing extent, largely as a consequence of the acquisition of carbapenemase genes. The treatment of infections caused by Enterobacter cloacae and other enterobacteriaceae has become a troublesome clinical problem in the case of limited therapeutic options. Resistance to Carbapenem caused by Enterobacter cloacae and other enterobacteriaceae is relatively rare; therefore, this class of drugs is the last line of defense against multidrug-resistant Enterobacter cloacae for the treatment of severe infections. Unfortunately, increasing production of New Delhi metallo-$\beta$-lactamase 1 (NDM-1) has become established as a major public health threat and represents a new challenge in the treatment of infectious diseases. In this study, we describe the ability of Enterobacter cloacae to produce carbapenemase enzymes based on the results of Modified Hodge test and the biochemical Carba NP test performed according to guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). Furthermore, we assessed the presence of genes in charge of the production of carbapenemases (blaKPC, blaVIM, blaIMP, blaOXA-48, blaNDM) among Enterobacter cloacae. The tested isolate of Enterobacter cloacae that occupied the blaNDM-1 and blaVIM-19 genes were determined. To our knowledge, this is the first detection of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacter cloacae (n=4) consisted of sequence type 508 (ST508) with NDM-1 and VIM-19, ST509 with NDM-1, and ST145 with VIM-19 in china.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective survey was made over a period of twelve months (year 2009). It focused on 3564 patients with urinary tract infection confirmed by the Laboratory of Microbiology in the University Hospital, Mahdia. RESULTS: Klebsiella spp. was involved in 5.5{\%} (198/3564) of all cases of urinary tract infections identified. Klebsiella pneumoniae accounted for 94.9{\%} of all Klebsiella (5.1{\%} for Klebsiella oxytoca). The frequency of Klebsiella spp. resistance to fluoroquinolones was 19.2{\%} and to third generation cephalosporins was 22.7{\%}. Forty strains of Klebsiella spp. producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase witch corresponds to 20.2{\%} of all the Klebsiella. The extended-spectrum beta-lactamase strains with resistance to fluoroquinolones were 67.5{\%} (27/40) or 13.6{\%} of all klebsiella (27/198). No strain was resistant to imipenem. The 27 strains multiresistant (ESBL+FQ resistance) are likely to be carriers of plasmids encoding the ESBL and resistance to fluoroquinolones.

Most studies on infection in burn patients focus on burn wound infection, whereas other nosocomial infections in these patients are not well described. We undertook this study to determine three types of nosocomial infections viz., burn wound infection, urinary tract infection, and blood stream infection in burn patients in a burn hospital in Iran. Methods: During the one year period (May 2003 to April 2004), 182 patients were included in this study. Blood, urine and wound biopsy samples were taken 7 and 14 days after admission to Taleghani Burn hospital. Isolation and identification of microorganisms was done using the standard procedure.

The cfr gene was first described in animal isolates of staphylococci, and more recently, it has been identified in Staphylococcus aureus from human clinical infections, including in an outbreak of methicillin-resistant S. aureus. In enterococci, cfr has been described in an animal isolate of Enterococcus faecalis from China. Here, we report an isolate of linezolid-resistant E. faecalis (603-50427X) recovered from a patient in Thailand who received prolonged therapy with the antibiotic for the treatment of atypical mycobacterial disease. The isolate lacked mutations in the genes coding for 23S rRNA and L3 and L4 ribosomal proteins and belonged to the multilocus sequence type (MLST) 16 (ST16), which is commonly found in enterococcal isolates from animal sources. Resistance to linezolid was associated with the presence of cfr on an {\~{}}97-kb transferable plasmid. The cfr gene environment exhibited DNA sequences similar to those of other cfr-carrying plasmids previously identified in staphylococci (nucleotide identity, 99 to 100{\%}). The cfr-carrying plasmid was transferable by conjugation to a laboratory strain of E. faecalis (OG1RF) but not to Enterococcus faecium or S. aureus.

After outbreak investigation, hygiene measures were implemented in all family households and childminders' homes. Several decontamination procedures were performed, which used a combination of topical mupirocin, total body application of chlorhexidine, chlorhexidine gargle (if {\textgreater}6 years old) and a course of antibiotic therapy in cases of infection or decontamination failure. Patients were followed up for MRSA skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) and carriage. Strains were characterised by antimicrobial drug resistance profile, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and DNA microarrays. Between June 2011 and June 2012, six children and six adults among the ten corresponding relatives developed 28 SSTIs. None of the family members, including the index case, had any contact with foreigners or individuals known to have SSTIs. After infection control measures and prolonged decontamination have been implemented with a high adherence, six patients remained sustained CA-MRSA USA300 carriers, including one who developed mupirocin resistance and six who experienced minor CA-MRSA-related SSTIs.

CA-MRSA decontamination using mupirocin and chlorhexidine in the community setting may also be a questionable strategy, associated with failure and resistance to both agents. Close monitoring of CA-MRSA SSTIs is required in France and in other European countries where MRSA USA300 has recently emerged.

Both in our country and worldwide specialists communicate the involvement of multiresistant strains in producing nosocomial infections (NI) that often have a severe evolution. 4544 patients were evaluated with various infections; we preleased samples from the infected site or blood cultures when necessary. 37.74{\%} had positive results, 35.16{\%} from them were MDR organisms and 21.8{\%} were noso-comial organisms. The incidence was maximum in 2004 for MDR (63.39{\%}) and in 2005 for nosocomial organisms (63.63{\%}). The positive blood cultures were only in ICU patients. We had 337 samples and 122 were positive (36.20{\%}). The most frequent organism was MRSA (25.41{\%}). The strains of Acinctobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa had a maximum prevalence of 12.5{\%} in 2005 for both organisms; the eight-year average was 2.46 and 4.91, respectively. We examined 563 urine samples from surgery ward; 24.9{\%} were positive and 3243 samples from ICU, 17.4{\%} were positive. Other samples (451, from 1715 patients- abdominal fluids, fistulae, wounds, abscesses, tracheal discharge, cellulites) produced nosocomial and MDR organisms (in average 26.29{\%}). Bacterial cultures were done. We isolated 1115 strains. Disk diffusion tests were performed and communicated according to the CLSI standard. Average values for MRSA are 28.4{\%}, for Enterobacteria 15.2{\%}, for Pseudomonas aeruginosa 13.2{\%}, for Enterococcus spp. 9.3{\%} and for Acinctobacter baumannii 4.9{\%}. As a result of exhausted antibiotic arsenal in many situations, we estimate that first intention therapy adapted to the Carmeli score and followed by reevaluation after microbiologic results and antibiotic susceptibility testing can reduce the amount of MDR strains.

In this context, we have applied Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) based whole genome analysis on three ocular isolates of MDR P. aeruginosa to explore the drug resistance determinants and genomic level variations. Methods: Three ocular isolates namely P. aeruginosa VRFP03, VRFPA04 from two different Keratitis patients (corneal button) and VRFPA05 isolated from the intraocular specimen (Vitreous humor) collected from an endophthalmitis patient was included in this study. Phenotypically VRFPA03, VRFPA04, VRFPA05 showed resistant to a wide group of antibiotics and hence they were taken up for Ion Torrent-PGM based whole genome study. Results: Here, we report the first complete genome sequence of MDR P. aeruginosa VRFPA04 isolated from the Indian keratitis patients clinical specimen (corneal button) submitted to L {\&} T Microbiology Research Centre, Vision Research Foundation, Sankara Nethralaya, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.

CR-KP and CR-EC were isolated from two Taiwanese patients without travel histories. Methods: Complete sequencing of the plasmids (pLK75 and pLK78) was conducted using a shotgun approach. Annotation of the contigs was performed using the RAST Server, followed by manual inspection and correction. Results: These similar plasmids were obtained from two patients with overlapping stays at the same hospital. The pLK75 and pLK78 plasmids were 56,489-bp and 56,072-bp in length, respectively. Plasmid annotation revealed a common backbone similar to the IncN plasmid pR46. The regions flanking the blaNDM-1 genes in these plasmids were very similar to plasmid pNDM-HU01 in Japan, which contains a complex class 1 integron located next to an ISCR1 element. The ISCR1 element has been suggested to provide a powerful mechanism for mobilising antibiotic resistance genes.

One patient lived in a nursing home and was never hospitalised, whereas the other patient was repeatedly hospitalised in this hospital. The aim of this study was to unveil the molecular mechanisms associated with the carbapenem resistance of these isolates and to assess its potential dissemination. Methods Isolate identification was performed by VITEK{\textregistered}2 and was confirmed by 16S rDNA sequencing. The clonal relationship of the isolates was evaluated by repetitive element palindromic PCR (rep-PCR). Antibiotic susceptibility was determined using the automatic VITEK{\textregistered}2 AES system and disk diffusion assay. $\beta$-Lactamases, porins and mobile genetic elements were characterised by PCR and sequencing. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and Southern blot hybridisation were used to determine the genetic location of integrons, and their transferability was tested by conjugation. Results No genetic relatedness was found, suggesting different origins of the isolates. In isolate Cf254 a VIM-2 carbapenemase integrated in In58 was detected, located in a high-frequency conjugative IncL/M plasmid that also carried CTX-M-15 and CMY-39 genes. VIM-1 in isolate Cf872 was chromosomal. This is the first description in Portugal of VIM carbapenemases in C. freundii. Loss/alteration of porins was also detected.

The pandemic sequence type (ST)8/pulsed-field gel type USA300 is the dominant CA-MRSA clone in the United States, but its evolutionary history and basis for biological success are incompletely understood. Here, we use whole-genome sequencing of 387 ST8 isolates drawn from an epidemiological network of CA-MRSA infections and colonizations in northern Manhattan to explore short-term evolution and transmission patterns. Phylogenetic analysis predicted that USA300 diverged from a most common recent ancestor around 1993. We found evidence for multiple introductions of USA300 and reconstructed the phylogeographic spread of isolates across neighborhoods. Using pair-wise single-nucleotide polymorphism distances as a measure of genetic relatedness between isolates, we observed that most USA300 isolates had become endemic in households, indicating their critical role as reservoirs for transmission and diversification. Using the maximum single-nucleotide polymorphism variability of isolates from within households as a threshold, we identified several possible transmission networks beyond households. Our study also revealed the evolution of a fluoroquinolone-resistant subpopulation in the mid-1990s and its subsequent expansion at a time of high-frequency outpatient antibiotic use. This high-resolution phylogenetic analysis of ST8 has documented the genomic changes associated with USA300 evolution and how some of its recent evolution has been shaped by antibiotic use.

6136,yes,fankhauser2011a,article,"Background: The rapid spread of New Delhi metallo-$\beta$-lactamase 1 (NDM-1) producing Enterobacteriaceae constitutes a global public health threat. Objective: To describe the clinical and epidemiological implications of 3 NDM-1 cases in Geneva. Methods: Retrospective case review with molecular identification. MICs of ertapenem, meropenem and imipenem were determined with Etests. ESBL production was tested using the cefotaxime-ceftazidime- clavulanic acid double-disc method. The presence of blaNDM-1 was determined by conventional PCR and DNA sequencing analysis with primers specific for blaNDM-1. Inhibition of blaNDM-1 activity was evaluated by disk approximation analysis. NDM-1 isolates were further investigated by PCR amplification to detect other resistance determinants. Results: Between December 2009 and January 2010, 3 NDM-1 isolates were identified at HUG belonging to three patients that were repatriated to Geneva after receiving medical treatment in India (1), Pakistan (2) and Serbia (3). On admission, patient 1 was a digestive carrier of E. coli blaNDM-1 and patient 3 had a urinary tract infection due to K. pneumoniae blaNDM-1. Patient 2 was discovered a digestive carrier of P. mirabilis blaNDM-1 only after extended hospitalization and antibiotic therapy. All patients carried other multiresistant organisms such as ESBL-producing Enterobacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Acinetobacter baumannii. Patient 1 harbored a highly resistant strain of E. coli blaNDM-1 showing in vitro susceptibility only to fosfomycine and tigecycline and a pan-resistant Acinetobacter blaNDM-1. Proteus blaNDM-1 (Patient 1) and K. pneumoniae blaNDM-1 (Patient 3) strains were also sensitive to ciprofloxacin. The patients were hospitalized in different wards; no cases of cross-transmission were identified due to early screening and preemptive isolation. The presence of NDM-1 was confirmed retrospectively after patient discharge. Conclusion: We report 3 imported cases of NDM-1 in Switzerland and underline challenges related to clinical management and early reliable identification. The threat of NDM-1 points out the importance of early detection, implementation of control measures and surveillance of patients transferred from the Balkan region and South Asia.",C Fankhauser and A Cherkaoui and G Renzi and J Schrenzel and S Harbarth,1198-743x,Clinical Microbiology and Infection,"Acinetobacter,Acinetobacter baumannii,DNA,DNA sequence,Enterobacteriaceae,Escherichia coli,India,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Mirabilis,Pakistan,Proteus,Pseudomonas aeruginosa,Serbia,South Asia,Switzerland,antibiotic therapy,cefotaxime,ceftazidime,ciprofloxacin,clavulanic acid,ertapenem,extended spectrum beta lactamase,extended spectrum beta lactamase producing Enterob,hospital discharge,hospitalization,human,imipenem,in vitro study,meropenem,patient,penicillinase,public health,screening,therapy,tigecycline,urinary tract infection,ward",s139,{First documented New Delhi metallo-$\beta$-lactamase 1 (NDM-1) cases in Switzerland},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l70599322 http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-0691.2011.03558.x http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=1198743x{\&}id=doi:10.1111{\%}2fj.1469-0691.2011.03558.x{\&}atitle=f,17,2011,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,yes,cale,yes,allison,allison,mushtaq,yes,md_3.csv,NA,NA,md_3_1.mex,yes,journal

20835,maybe,tietze2015,article,"A large outbreak of gastrointestinal disease occurred in 2011 in Germany which resulted in almost 4000 patients with acute gastroenteritis or hemorrhagic colitis, 855 cases of a hemolytic uremic syndrome and 53 deaths. The pathogen was an uncommon, multiresistant Escherichia coli strain of serotype O104:H4 which expressed a Shiga toxin characteristic of enterohemorrhagic E. coli and in addition virulence factors common to enteroaggregative E. coli. During post-epidemic surveillance of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) all but two of O104:H4 isolates were indistinguishable from the epidemic strain. Here we describe two novel STEC O104:H4 strains isolated in close spatiotemporal proximity to the outbreak which show a virulence gene panel, a Shiga toxin-mediated cytotoxicity towards Vero cells and aggregative adherence to Hep-2 cells comparable to the outbreak strain. They differ however both from the epidemic strain and from each other, by their antibiotic resistance phenotypes and some other features as determined by routine epidemiological subtyping methods. Whole genome sequencing of these two strains, of ten outbreak strain isolates originating from different time points of the outbreak and of one historical sporadic EHEC O104:H4 isolate was performed. Sequence analysis revealed a clear phylogenetic distance between the two variant strains and the outbreak strain finally identifying them as epidemiologically unrelated isolates from sporadic cases. These findings add to the knowledge about this emerging pathogen, illustrating a certain diversity within the bacterial core genome as well as loss and gain of accessory elements. Our results do also support the view that distinct new variants of STEC O104:H4 repeatedly might originate from yet unknown reservoirs, rather than that there would be a continuous diversification of a single epidemic strain established and circulating in Germany after the large outbreak in 2011.",E Tietze and P W Dabrowski and R Prager and A Radonic and A Fruth and P Aurass and A Nitsche and M Mielke and A Flieger,1932-6203,PLoS ONE,"*Shiga-Toxigenic Escherichia coli/classification/g,Animals,Bacterial Adhesion,Cercopithecus aethiops,DNA, Bacterial/genetics,Disease Outbreaks,Escherichia coli Infections/epidemiology/*microbio,Genome, Bacterial,Germany/epidemiology,Hep G2 Cells,Humans,Molecular Sequence Data,Phylogeny,Plasmids/genetics,Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide,Sequence Analysis, DNA,Serogroup,Vero Cells,Virulence/genetics",e0122074,{Comparative genomic analysis of two novel sporadic Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli O104:H4 strains isolated 2011 in Germany},NA,10,2015,4,"1932-6203tietze, erharddabrowski, piotr wojciechprager, ritaradonic, aleksandarfruth, angelikaaurass, philippnitsche, andreasmielke, martinflieger, antjecomparative studyjournal articleresearch support, non-u.s. gov'tunited statesplos one. 2015 apr 2;10(4):e0122074. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0122074. ecollection 2015.",10.1371/journal.pone.0122074,4/4/15,eng,25836671,yes,melanie,maybe,zach,zach,mushtaq,yes,md_3.csv,NA,NA,md_3_2.mex,yes,journal

11249,yes,kumarasamy2010,article,"Background: Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae with resistance to carbapenem conferred by New Delhi metallo-$\beta$-lactamase 1 (NDM-1) are potentially a major global health problem. We investigated the prevalence of NDM-1, in multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in India, Pakistan, and the UK. Methods: Enterobacteriaceae isolates were studied from two major centres in India-Chennai (south India), Haryana (north India)-and those referred to the UK's national reference laboratory. Antibiotic susceptibilities were assessed, and the presence of the carbapenem resistance gene blaNDM-1 was established by PCR. Isolates were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of XbaI-restricted genomic DNA. Plasmids were analysed by S1 nuclease digestion and PCR typing. Case data for UK patients were reviewed for evidence of travel and recent admission to hospitals in India or Pakistan. Findings: We identified 44 isolates with NDM-1 in Chennai, 26 in Haryana, 37 in the UK, and 73 in other sites in India and Pakistan. NDM-1 was mostly found among Escherichia coli (36) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (111), which were highly resistant to all antibiotics except to tigecycline and colistin. K pneumoniae isolates from Haryana were clonal but NDM-1 producers from the UK and Chennai were clonally diverse. Most isolates carried the NDM-1 gene on plasmids: those from UK and Chennai were readily transferable whereas those from Haryana were not conjugative. Many of the UK NDM-1 positive patients had travelled to India or Pakistan within the past year, or had links with these countries. Interpretation: The potential of NDM-1 to be a worldwide public health problem is great, and co-ordinated international surveillance is needed.

11734,yes,lee2013b,article,"Background/Purpose: Typhoid fever is a major cause of disease burden in developing countries. The use of fluoroquinolones, once considered the drugs of choice, should be re-evaluated due to the emergence of quinolone-resistant Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi. In Taiwan, typhoid fever is rare but constitutes an important public health concern. Methods: In August 2011, two ciprofloxacin-resistant S. Typhi isolates were identified from one patient who had recently travelled to India. The two isolates together with four other ciprofloxacin-susceptible S. Typhi isolates were subjected for molecular investigation. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing were used to analyze the resistance mechanisms. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was performed to delineate the genetic relatedness among the isolates. Results: In 2011, a total of 49 typhoid fever cases were reported to the Center for Disease Control in Taiwan, with a significant increase in indigenous cases in northern Taiwan from August to November. In the two S. Typhi isolates with complete resistance to ciprofloxacin [minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) {\textgreater}32$\mu$g/mL], multiple point mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) of gyrA and parC genes were identified. A unique PFGE pattern was found in the resistant isolates and was different from the other representative susceptible isolates. Conclusions: The first ciprofloxacin-resistant S. Typhi infection in Taiwan is reported. The emergence and spread of antimicrobial-resistant S. Typhi infection as a result of international travel may become a threat to public health in Taiwan. Clinicians should be well alert when treating patients who may have acquired resistant infections associated with international travel among endemic regions. {\textcopyright} 2013 .",C J Lee and L H Su and Y C Huang and C H Chiu,"1684-11821995-9133","Journal of Microbiology, Immunology and Infection",",*Drug Resistance,Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology,Bacterial,Bacterial/chemistry/genetics,Ciprofloxacin resistance,Ciprofloxacin/*pharmacology,DNA,DNA Gyrase/genetics,DNA Topoisomerase IV/genetics,DNA topoisomerase (ATP hydrolysing) A,Electrophoresis,Female,Gel,Genotype,Humans,India,International travel,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Missense,Mutation,Point Mutation,Polymerase Chain Reaction,Pulsed-Field,Quinolone resistance-determining regions,Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi,Salmonella typhi/*drug effects/genetics/*isolation,Sequence Analysis,Taiwan,Travel,Typhoid Fever/*microbiology,Young Adult,adult,ampicillin,antibiotic resistance,antibiotic sensitivity,article,bacterial gene,bacterium identification,bacterium isolate,bacterium isolation,case report,cefixime,ceftriaxone,chloramphenicol,ciprofloxacin,ciprofloxacin resistant Salmonella typhi,controlled study,cotrimoxazole,diarrhea,ertapenem,female,fever,flomoxef,gene identification,gene sequence,genetic similarity,human,imipenem,minimum inhibitory concentration,nonhuman,point mutation,polymerase chain reaction,protein ParC,pulsed field gel electrophoresis,quinolone,typhoid fever",469--473,{First isolation of ciprofloxacin-resistant Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi in Taiwan},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l52471489 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2013.01.002 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=16841182{\&}id=doi:10.1016{\%}2fj.jmii.2013.01.002{\&}atitle=first+isolati,46,2013,6,"from duplicate 1 (first isolation of ciprofloxacin-resistant salmonella enterica serovar typhi in taiwan - lee, c j; su, l h; huang, y c; chiu, c h)1995-9133lee, chia-jiesu, lin-huihuang, yhu-cheringchiu, cheng-hsuncase reportsjournal articleresearch support, non-u.s. gov'tenglandj microbiol immunol infect. 2013 dec;46(6):469-73. doi: 10.1016/j.jmii.2013.01.002. epub 2013 mar 5.",10.1016/j.jmii.2013.01.002,3/8/13,eng,23465712,yes,brooke,no,mushtaq,zach,mushtaq,yes,md_3.csv,NA,NA,md_3_1.mex,yes,journal
18363,maybe,santos2007,article,"Background: Delivery of tobramycin by inhalation to the lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) who are infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been proven to be effective and safe. The aerosol administration allows high concentrations of tobramycin to be delivered to the site of infection with limited systemic absorption. In rare patients, systemic absorption of inhaled tobramycin may be significant enough to produce toxic effects, such as renal and vestibular toxicities. Case presentation: We report a patient with CF who developed recurrent eosinophilia and severe persistent bronchospasm following repeated administration of preservative-free tobramycin by inhalation, beginning at 16 months of age. Also, he developed similar signs and symptoms when he was administered tobramycin intravenously on one occasion at 5 1/2 years. The patient had a history of environmental allergies. Temporal sequence of his signs and symptoms after each administration of tobramycin (similar to re-challenge testing), and his improvement after discontinuation of the drug strongly suggest an adverse drug reaction. Conclusion: Hypersensitivity reaction should be considered in patients who develop recurrent eosinophilia and deterioration of pulmonary function following the use of tobramycin by inhalation or by intravenous administration. {\textcopyright} 2007 Santos et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",R P Santos and E Awa and R D Anbar,1471-2431,BMC Pediatrics,"Achromobacter xylosoxidans,Pseudomonas aeruginosa,Serratia marcescens,Staphylococcus aureus,airway obstruction,amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid,anamnesis,antibiotic agent,antibiotic resistance,antibody blood level,antibody titer,article,azithromycin,bacterial infection,bronchodilating agent,bronchospasm,budesonide,case report,ceftazidime,child,ciprofloxacin,computer assisted tomography,coughing,cromoglycate disodium,cystic fibrosis,differential diagnosis,dornase alfa,drug dose increase,drug treatment failure,drug withdrawal,enzyme replacement,eosinophil count,eosinophilia,familial disease,forced expiratory volume,human,immunoglobulin E,laboratory test,lung aspergillosis,lung function test,lung infiltrate,male,montelukast,multivitamin,nasal biopsy,nebulization,nonhuman,pancreas enzyme,pancreas insufficiency,pathogenesis,prednisolone,prednisone,recurrent disease,retreatment,salbutamol,sinusitis,thorax radiography,tobi,tobramycin,treatment response,upper respiratory tract infection,wheezing",NA,{Inhaled tobramycin solution-associated recurrent eosinophilia and severe persistent bronchospasm in a patient with cystic fibrosis: A case report},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l46420093 http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2431-7-11 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=14712431{\&}id=doi:10.1186{\%}2f1471-2431-7-11{\&}atitle=inhaled+tobramycin+so,7,2007,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,maybe,jake,no,ayomide,mushtaq,mushtaq,yes,md_3.csv,NA,NA,md_3_2.mex,yes,journal
3722,maybe,chery2013,article,"INTRODUCTION Lactobacillus species are probiotics proven to exhibit various preventative as well as therapeutic properties. While lactobacillus species have been implicated in the formation of dental caries, endocarditis and bacteremia, their role as pathogens in cholecystitis has not been reported. We present a rare case of Lactobacillus fermentum working as a pathogen in cholecystitis. PRESENTATION OF CASE An 81-year old male was admitted with right upper quadrant abdominal pain. His signs, symptoms, laboratory values and imaging were consistent with a diagnosis of cholecystitis with ascending cholangitis. In view of his co-morbidity and severe sepsis, the patient was treated non-operatively with antibiotics and cholecystostomy. L. fermentum, which was vancomycin resistant, was identified from the cholecystostomy aspirate and from anaerobic blood culture. The patient went into septic shock, developed multi-organ dysfunction syndrome and eventually died. DISCUSSION Commensal bacteria such as L. fermentum are known to modulate immunity, reduce the pathogenicity of gastrointestinal organisms and play a therapeutic role in various disease processes. We isolated L. fermentum as a pathogen in a documented case of cholecystitis with ascending cholangitis. CONCLUSION While the routine use lactobacillus species as a probiotic is supported in the literature, understanding its potential role as a pathogen may allow more judicious use of these bacteria and encourage research to elucidate the pathogenicity of lactobacillus species. {\textcopyright} 2013 Surgical Associates Ltd.",J Chery and D Dvoskin and F P Morato and B Fahoum,2210-2612,International Journal of Surgery Case Reports,"Candida,Lactobacillus fermentum,abdominal distension,abdominal tenderness,acute kidney failure,aged,agitation,alkaline phosphatase,alkaline phosphatase blood level,anemia,antibiotic therapy,article,ascites,aztreonam,bacterium culture,bacterium detection,bilirubin,blood clotting disorder,case report,cholecystitis,cholecystostomy,cholelithiasis,computer assisted tomography,creatinine,death,depression,deterioration,drug substitution,drug withdrawal,dysuria,echography,endotracheal intubation,eye jaundice,heart arrest,hemoglobin,hemoglobin blood level,human,hypertension,hypoxia,intensive care,international normalized ratio,leukocyte count,leukocytosis,linezolid,liver function test,magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography,male,metronidazole,nausea and vomiting,noradrenalin,physical examination,priority journal,sepsis,upper abdominal pain,urine culture,vasopressin",662--664,"{Lactobacillus fermentum, a pathogen in documented cholecystitis}",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l369196751 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2013.04.034 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=22102612{\&}id=doi:10.1016{\%}2fj.ijscr.2013.04.034{\&}atitle=lactobacil,4,2013,8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,maybe,brooke,maybe,zach,zach,mushtaq,yes,md_3.csv,NA,NA,md_3_1.mex,yes,journal

Most countries have reported an increase in CoNS infections in hospitalized patients that are resistant to methicillin and other antibiotics. Despite of it information of population structure and global epidemiology of Staphylococcus epidermidis and some other CoNS is scare. The goal of investigation was to analyze collection of CoNS from diverse clinical origins using molecular genotyping. Methods: CoNS isolates were recovered from the blood (36), umbilical wound (10), conjunctivitis (33), urine (1), pulmonary tissue (2) in 2009- 2010. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by standard methods. Species identification was carried out by amplification and sequencing of tuf gene. S. epidermidis isolates were analyzed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) by protocol, as described by Thomas J.C. et al. (2007). MLST of Staphylococcus haemolyticus isolates was performed using original primers sets. Structural components of staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) were tested by PCR additionally. Results: Identification of CoNS at the species level indicated that S. epidermidis was the most common species with 46 isolates, followed by S. haemolyticus (18), Staphylococcus hominis (10), Staphylococcus warneri (7), Staphylococcus pasteuri (1). 69 (84.2{\%}) isolates were methicillin-resistant. Among S. epidermidis isolates 24 ST were discovered, including 5 new. New alleles for 5 analysing genes were discovered two. ST59 was predominated (41.3{\%}. isolates). S. epidermidis isolates carried SCCmec IV, composite variant SCCmec (mecB+, ccr1,+ccr2) or unusual patterns with two mec gene complexes (class A and class B). Among S. haemolyticus isolates 9 St were recovered. Isolates carried modified SCCmec type IV (ccr2+, comlex mec class B 1kbp), or elements SCCmecV (ccr5+).

The emerging New Delhi metallo-$\beta$-lactamase (NDM), an acquired class B carbapenemase has gain public attention due to its extended hydrolysis of $\beta$-lactams including carbapenems. Objective: We report the first isolates of this emerging resistance mechanism in our hospitals in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Methods: Between September and October 2013, four carbapenem-resistant strains, three Enterobacter cloacae and one Providencia rettgeri were isolated in our clinical Microbiology Lab from distinct patients hospitalized at different hospitals located at two distinct cities of Rio de Janeiro. MIC was determined by CLSI broth microdilution method. Specific primers were used for PCR detection of blaNDM, blaKPC, blaGES, blaSPM, blaGIM, blaSIM, blaCTX-M, blaSHV, blaTEM, blaOXA-48, armA, rmtA, rmtB, rmtC, rmtD, rmtG, npmA followed by DNA sequencing. Clonal relatedness among E. cloacae isolates was examined by PFGE. Plasmid extraction was performed by Kieser protocol. Conjugation with E. coli J53 (LacZ- Nalr Rifr) and hybridization with specific probes were used to determine transfer of carbapenem resistance. The species identification was confirmed by MALDI-ToF MS{\textregistered} and 16sRNA DNA sequencing. Results: Of the four isolates, three were from public hospital and one from a private hospital. Enterobacter cloacae were isolated in blood, ascitic fluid and rectal swab and one Providencia rettgeri was isolated in urine. All strains showed higher resistant rates to carbapenems and to broad-spectrum cephalosporins and P. rettgeri was resistant to polymyxin B, as expected. blaNDM-1 and blaTEM-1 were identified in all isolates. All E. cloacae also produced blaCTX-M-15, and showed different PFGE pattern. blaKPC-2 was identified in one E. cloacae isolate (isolate E134) and armA gene was detected in E. cloacae gentamicin and amikacin resistant (isolate E133). Conjugation of blaNDM-1 was achieved in 2/4 isolates, E. cloacae (isolate E134) and P. rettgeri (isolate E132). The hybridization revealed that blaKPC-2 was located in the E. cloacae chromosome. The genetic location of blaNDM-1 is being confirmed among the isolates evaluated. Conclusion: Those isolates in Rio de Janeiro, showed the importance of correct molecular study of isolates that express carbapenenem resistance in the clinical Microbiology Lab, as, although the blaNDM-1 has been previously reported in Enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates in our country, this study constitutes the first one that identified the co-association of blaNDM-1 and blaKPC-2 in E. cloacae.

Here we describe a NDM-1 case in the Netherlands, imported from the Balkan area, and a secondary case in the same hospital. Materials and methods: The study was performed as part of a retrospective analysis on a collection of 485 Enterobacteriaceae isolates, from patients in the east of the Netherlands. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing and species identification were performed by the VITEC 2. Cabapenems MIC values were determined by the E-test. Phenotypic ESBL confirmation was performed by a combination disc diffusion. For phenotypic confirmation of carbapenemase production, the modified Hodge test (MHT) and two inhibitor-based tests: ertapenem-boronic acid and imipenem-EDTA, were used. A microarray was used for genotypic characterisation of ESBL's and carbapenemases. Characterisation of NDM-gene and plasmid analysis, were done using PCR, sequencing and cloning. Genetic relatedness is tested by Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP). For genotyping the Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was used. Results: Two ESBL producing K. pneumoniae strains from two patients were selected for further analysis by their elevated MIC's to meropenem. One patient was transferred from a hospital in Belgrado, Bosnia, to hospital in the east of the Netherlands on the 27th of August 2008 and directly placed in a separate room in isolation because of MRSA carriage. The second patient, with no travel history outside the Netherlands, was admitted to the same hospital between the 10th of October and the 7th of November 2008. The results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing and phenotypic confirmations are shown in Table 1. Molecular gene analysis revealed NDM-1, CTX-M-15, SHV-12, TEM-1, and OXA-1. Molecular plasmid analysis revealed the presence of a 70 kb, Inc II plasmid containing the bla NDM-1, and a 140 kb plasmid in both isolates. AFLP showed that both strains were identical. MLST analysis showed that both isolates belong to ST15. (Table Presented) Conclusions: This first encountered NDM-1 producing K. pneumoniae in the Netherlands underlines further that Balkan states constitute a secondary reservoir for NDM-1 producers. While cross transmission in Europe of NDM-1 producers has sporadically been reported, the index case was associated with a secondary case despite proactive measures aimed to control spread of resistant bacteria.",T Halaby and E A Reuland and N {Al Naiemi} and A Potron and P H M Savelkoul and C M J E Vandenbroucke-Grauls and P Nordmann,1198-743x,Clinical Microbiology and Infection,"Enterobacteriaceae,Europe,Gram negative bacterium,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Netherlands,amplified fragment length polymorphism,antibiotic sensitivity,bacterium,boronic acid derivative,carbapenemase,cloning,disk diffusion,edetic acid,epsilometer test,ertapenem,extended spectrum beta lactamase,gene,genotype,hospital,human,imipenem,infection,meropenem,metallo beta lactamase,methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus,microbiology,minimum inhibitory concentration,multilocus sequence typing,patient,penicillinase,plasmid,species identification,travel",258--259,{A case of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1 in the Netherlands with secondary transmission},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l70822815 http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-0691.2012.03802.x http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=1198743x{\&}id=doi:10.1111{\%}2fj.1469-0691.2012.03802.x{\&}atitle=a,18,2012,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,maybe,brooke,no,mushtaq,zach,mushtaq,yes,md_3.csv,NA,NA,md_3_1.mex,yes,journal

METHODS: We included patients presenting with PVL producing S. aureus infection from seven hospitals in the NPDC region, between February 2004 and April 2008. We retrospectively collected patient data using a standardized questionnaire. The features of patients presenting with skin and soft tissue were then analyzed. RESULTS: PVL producing S. aureus was isolated from 64 patients. Fifty-four patients presented with skin and soft tissue infections. The mean age of patients was 23.8 years (63{\%} male patients). The mean number of persons living with the infected patient was 4.5 (vs. 2.5 in NPDC). The lesions were abscesses with inflammatory signs in 64.8{\%} of the cases (20{\%} were necrotic). Among the patients, 70.3{\%} carried a methicillin resistant strain. Antibiotics per os were used for 83.3{\%} of patients; the first-line antibiotics were considered inadequate in 53.3{\%} of the cases. Among the patients, 83.3{\%} underwent surgery.

Methods We collected 138 non-repeated Acinetobacter baumannii strains isolated from the ICU in-patients' sputum/bronchial secretion samples during December 2010 and December 2011, these patients were from 6 hospitals in different places of Hunan province and their hospitalization time was more than 48 hours. We used REP-PCR and MLST to analyse Genotyping and homology. We detected blaOXA-51, blaOXA-23, blaOXA-24, blaOXA-58 and blaNDM-1 by PCR. All the drug-susceptibility test results and patients' clinical datas were also collected at the same time. Results All of the 138 Acinetobacter baumannii strains were divided into 6 gene types by REP-PCR, the mayor type was type A. MLST divided the A1 subtype of the type A into 8 distinct sequence types, the main sequence types was ST191,we also discovered the ST381 for the first time in China. The Carbapenemases gene-positive Acinetobacter baumannii widely distributed, all the 138 strains contained OXA-51 but were negative for OXA-24, OXA-58 and NDM-1 gene, 80.43{\%} isolates were positive for OXA-23 gene.

19883,maybe,stavrum2009,article,"BACKGROUND: India has the highest estimated burden of tuberculosis in the world, accounting for 21{\%} of all tuberculosis cases world-wide. However, due to lack of systematic analysis using multiple markers the available information on the genomic diversity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in India is limited. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Thus, 65 M. tuberculosis isolates from New Delhi, India were analyzed by spoligotyping, MIRU-VNTR, large deletion PCR typing and single nucleotide polymorphism analysis (SNP). The Central Asian (CAS) 1 {\_}DELHI sub-lineage was the most prevalent sub-lineage comprising 46.2{\%} (n = 30) of all isolates, with shared-type (ST) 26 being the most dominant genotype comprising 24.6{\%} (n = 16) of all isolates. Other sub-lineages observed were: East-African Indian (EAI)-5 (9.2{\%}, n = 6), EAI6{\_}BGD1 (6.2{\%}, n = 4), EAI3{\_}IND, CAS and T1 with 6.2{\%} each (n = 4 each), Beijing (4.6{\%}, n = 3), CAS2 (3.1{\%}, n = 2), and X1 and X2 with 1 isolate each. Genotyping results from five isolates (7.7{\%}) did not match any existing spoligopatterns, and one isolate, ST124, belonged to an undefined lineage. Twenty-six percent of the isolates belonged to the TbD1+ PGG1 genogroup. SNP analysis of the pncA gene revealed a CAS-lineage specific silent mutation, S65S, which was observed for all CAS-lineage isolates (except two ST26 isolates) and in 1 orphan. Mutations in the pncA gene, conferring resistance to pyrazinamide, were observed in 15.4{\%} of all isolates. Collectively, mutations in the rpoB gene, the katG gene and in both rpoB and katG genes, conferring resistance to rifampicin and isoniazid, respectively, were more frequent in CAS1{\_}DELHI isolates compared to non-CAS{\_}DELHI isolates (OR: 3.1, CI95{\%} [1.11, 8.70], P = 0.045). The increased frequency of drug-resistance could not be linked to the patients' history of previous anti-tuberculosis treatment (OR: 1.156, CI95{\%} [0.40, 3.36], P = 0.79). Fifty-six percent of all new tuberculosis patients had mutations in either the katG gene or the rpoB gene, or in both katG and rpoB genes. CONCLUSION: CAS1{\_}DELHI isolates circulating in New Delhi, India have a high frequency of mutations in the rpoB and katG genes.

In enterococci, cfr has been described only in an animal isolate of Enterococcus faecalis from China, but isolates from human origin have not been characterized. Here, we report an isolate of linezolid-resistant E. faecalis (603- 50427X) recovered from a patient in Thailand who received prolonged therapy with the antibiotic for the treatment of atypical mycobacterial disease. Methods: Linezolid MIC of the E. faecalis 603-50427X was confirmed by Etest and the Sequence type (ST) was determined by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). The presence of mutations in genes encoding all copies of the 23S rRNA and ribosomal proteins L3 and L4 were investigated by PCR and sequencing. Detection of the presence of the cfr gene was performed by PCR and the entire gene was sequenced. In order to determine plasmid localization of cfr; S1 digestion, PFGE and Southern hybridization with a cfr probe within the genome of E. faecalis 603-50427X, were performed. The DNA sequence upstream and downstream of cfr was obtained using inverse PCR methodology and sequencing. Conjugative transfer of cfr was conducted by filter mating using E. faecalis 603-50427X as donor and E. faecalis OG1RF, Enterococcus faecium GE1 and Staphylococcus aureus RN4220-RF as recipients. Results: The isolate lacked mutations in the genes coding for 23S rRNA, L3 and L4 ribosomal proteins and belonged to the ST16. Resistance to linezolid was associated to the presence of cfr on a â¼97- kb transferable plasmid. The cfr gene environment exhibited DNA sequences similar (nucleotide identity 99-100{\%}) to other cfr plasmid associated regions previously described in staphylococci.

She was transferred to our hospital 5 days after the cesarean for severe colitis. A rapid test of stool for Clostridium difficile toxin A and B was positive. Although oral vancomycin (0.5-2.0 g/day) and intravenous immunoglobulin (5 g/day) were administered after her transfer, 7 days after admission emergency exploratory surgery was performed because of poor response to therapy. Bowel perforation was noted and a temporary colostomy was created without colectomy. Vancomycin (2.0 g/day) was administered via the colostomy, in addition to a vancomycin enema (2.0 g/day), oral metronidazole (1500 mg/day), and oral vancomycin (2.0 g/day). Three days after the operation, linezolid (1200 mg/day IV) was added. She was treated with antibiotics against C. difficile for a total of 18 days after the operation. The same strain was not isolated from other patients in the same ward. Microbiological analysis of the isolate revealed housekeeping gene (tpi), toxin A gene (tcdA), toxin B gene (tcdB), and binary toxin gene (cdtA and cdtB).

Both agents can be acquired in the hospital but clinical disease can develop in a community setting, after discharge. We report here a putative link between the above-mentioned healthcare associated infections that appeared as a dramatic community onset disease with a fulminant fatal outcome. Case presentation: We describe the case of a 63 year old man affected by severe CDI. Even though the patient underwent 72 hours of standard CDI antibiotic treatment, the clinical course was complicated by toxic megacolon and KPC-Kp BSI. The patient died 24 hours after total colectomy. Conclusion: The impact of HCA-BSIs in complicating CDI is still unknown. Intestinal inflammatory injury and disruption of intestinal flora by standard antibiotic treatment could be responsible for promoting difficult-to-treat infections in CDI.

3624,maybe,chen2014j,article,"Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing K. pneumoniae strains have spread worldwide and become a major threat in health care facilities. Transmission of blaKPC, the plasmid-borne KPC gene, can be mediated by clonal spread and horizontal transfer. Here, we report the complete nucleotide sequences of two novel blaKPC-3-harboring IncFIA plasmids, pBK30661 and pBK30683. pBK30661 is 74 kb in length, with a mosaic plasmid structure; it exhibits homologies to several other plasmids but lacks the plasmid transfer operon (tra) and the origin of transfer (oriT) that are required for plasmid transfer. pBK30683 is a conjugative plasmid with a cointegrated plasmid structure, comprising a 72-kb element that highly resembles pBK30661 ({\textgreater}99.9{\%} nucleotide identities) and an extra 68-kb element that harbors tra and oriT. A PCR scheme was designed to detect the distribution of blaKPC-harboring IncFIA (pBK30661-like and pBK30683-like) plasmids in a collection of clinical Enterobacteriaceae isolates from 10 hospitals in New Jersey and New York. KPC-harboring IncFIA plasmids were found in 20{\%} of 491 K. pneumoniae isolates, and all carried blaKPC-3. pBK30661-like plasmids were identified mainly in the epidemic sequence type 258 (ST258) K. pneumoniae clone, while pBK30683-like plasmids were widely distributed in ST258 and other K. pneumoniae sequence types and among non-K. pneumoniae Enterobacteriaceae species. This suggests that both clonal spread and horizontal plasmid transfer contributed to the dissemination of blaKPC-harboring IncFIA plasmids in our area. Further studies are needed to understand the distribution of this plasmid group in other health care regions and to decipher the origins of pBK30661-like and pBK30683-like plasmids.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Records of six patients with S. maltophilia endophthalmitis between January 1, 1998, and December 31, 2007, were reviewed. RESULTS: Clinical settings included post-trauma (2 eyes), post-cataract extraction (2 eyes), post-keratoplasty with keratitis (1 eye), and post-vitreous lavage (1 eye). Presenting visual acuity ranged from counting fingers to no light perception. Final visual acuity ranged from 10/20 to no light perception. Initial treatment included pars plana vitrectomy in 4 eyes and tap in 2 eyes. Most isolates were susceptible to fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or moxifloxacin) and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim; however, they were resistant to ceftazidime and aminoglycosides. CONCLUSION: S. maltophilia is an uncommon causative agent of endophthalmitis and is resistant to commonly used antibiotics, such as ceftazidime and aminoglycosides.

In this study, the characteristics of Staphylococcus aureus isolates from patients who had undergone adenoidectomy were investigated via spa typing method. Methods: A total of 113 children with adenoid hypertrophy who underwent adenoidectomy during September 2009 to November 2010, were included in the study. The isolates were identified to the species level as S. aureus using standard biochemical methods, following which the amplification and sequencing of the spa gene X region were carried out. Results: S. aureus was found in the adenoid tissue of 26 (23{\%}) patients. Out of the 26 S. aureus isolates, 5 (19{\%}), 3 (11.5{\%}) and 3 (11.5{\%}) were resistant to tetracycline, erythromycin and oxacillin respectively. All the isolates were susceptible to vancomycin, rifampin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, mupirocin and quinupristin-dalfopristin and were typed using spa typing method. All the isolates were found to include 21 spa types, including two previously unreported types (t7685 and t7692). The most prevalent spa types were t7685 (11.5{\%}), t230 (8{\%}), t325 (8{\%}) and t1149 (8{\%}).

12403,maybe,lo2015b,article,"Introduction: Corynebacteria have an important place among the commensal flora of the skin and mucous membranes. Except for Corynebacterium diphtheriae, they were once considered contaminants of mucosa. Recent publications in medical bacteriology have highlighted the importance of several species, such as C. aurimucosum. To the best of our knowledge, we report the first isolation of this strain from urine. Case presentation: We report a case of a patient with a urinary tract infection with C. aurimucosum. We isolated this bacterium from a 52-year-old man of Wolof ethniticity (an ethnic group in Senegal, West Africa) at the regional hospital of Saint Louis, Senegal. Microscopic examination of his total urine sample showed coryneform Gram-positive bacilli associated with a high leukocyte reaction. After repeated isolation of the corynebacteria in three samples from the patient's urine, it was identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The strain was susceptible to antibiotics, except for penicillin and co-trimoxazole. The potential infectious role of these commensal species in several infections should be taken into consideration. Conclusions: This case highlights the significant proportion of species in the genus Corynebacterium other than dyphteriae in the infectious process. The use of mass spectrometry for identification highlights the originality of this work and the importance of these new diagnostic tools that are unavailable in most health facilities of countries with limited resources. We share the results of our method of identification of the isolated bacteria.

11344,maybe,kyratsa2012,article,"Objectives: To analyze clinical and laboratory data in 31 infections due to Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates with reduced susceptibility to carbapenems. Methods: All nosocomial infections due to K. pneumoniae strains with reduced susceptibility to carbapenems (MIC in meropenem: (1) were recorded in our hospital from November 2010 through November 2011, according to a National Surveillance Study for the management of multi-drug resistant Gram-negative pathogens. Of 31 clinical isolates were recovered from 25 patients in our laboratory. Susceptibility tests were performed by Kirby-Bauer method, MIC determination by automated system (Phoenix, BD) and E-test method (Biomerieux SA, France) according CLSI standards. Preliminary phenotypic detection was based on the boronic acid disk test, a simple phenotypic algorithm employing three combined-disc tests consisting of meropenem alone and with phenylboronic acid (PBA), EDTA, and both PBA and EDTA. Genotypic confirmation for the presence of the bla-KPC gene by PCR and molecular typing by PFGE. Results: Of 12 cases of bacteremia, seven catheter related infections, three surgical site infections, two lower respiratory tract infections, five ventilator-associated pneumonia and two urinary tract infections were identified. Twenty-three infections were recorded in ICU, four in Surgical and four in Internal Medicine unit respectively. Ninteen out of 25 patients were mechanically ventilated, 21 had central venous catheter and 25 urinary-bladder catheter. The crude mortality, 28 days after the first positive culture, was 32{\%}. Multidrug resistance characterized the studied isolates with an MIC range to meromenem â¤1 to (32, with colistin, gentamicin and tigecycline being the most active agents. Boronic acid disk test was able to differentiate 26 KPC, 3 MBL producers and two co-producers of both carbapenemases. PCR confirmed that all 26 isolates produce KPC- 2 b-lactamases and belong to the same dominant genotype in Greece. Conclusion: In Greek hospitals, carbapenem resistance among Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolates, is alarming and poses a unique challenge for clinical microbiologists and clinicians. Continuation of antibiotic policy and proper infection control practices and barriers to prevent further spread, is mandatory.

The first reports of VRE isolation were from hemodialysis patients. However, to date, VRE fecal colonization rates as well as associated risk factors in kidney transplant patients have not yet been established in prospective studies. Methods: We collected one or two stool samples from 280 kidney transplant patients and analysed the prevalence of VRE and its associated risk factors. Patients were evaluated according to the post-transplant period: group 1, less than 30 days after transplantation (102 patients), group 2, one to 6 months after transplantation (73 patients) and group 3, more than 6 months after transplantation (105 patients). Results: The overall prevalence nate of fecal VRE colonization was 13.6{\%} (38/280), respectively 13.7{\%} for Group 1, 15.1{\%} for group 2 and 12.4{\%} for group 3. E. faecium and E faecalis comprised 50{\%} of all VRE isolates. No immunologic variables were clearly correlated with VRE colonization and no infections related to VRE colonization were reported. Conclusion: Fecal VRE colonization rates in kidney transplant patients were as high as those reported for other high-risk groups, such as critical care and hemodialysis patients. This high rate of VRE colonization observed in kidney transplant recipients may have clinical relevance in infectious complications. {\textcopyright} 2006 Freitas et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",M C S Freitas and A Pacheco-Silva and D Barbosa and S Silbert and H Sader and R Sesso and L F A Camargo,1471-2334,BMC Infectious Diseases,"Enterococcus faecalis,Enterococcus faecium,adult,ampicillin,antibiotic resistance,article,azathioprine,bacterial colonization,bacterium isolate,bacterium isolation,cefalotin,correlation analysis,corticosteroid,cotrimoxazole,cyclosporin,cytomegalovirus infection,disease association,drug megadose,enterococcal infection,feces analysis,female,follow up,ganciclovir,gentamicin,graft recipient,graft rejection,hemodialysis,high risk patient,human,immunosuppressive treatment,intensive care,kidney failure,kidney transplantation,lymphocyte antibody,major clinical study,male,methylprednisolone,monoclonal antibody,mycophenolate mofetil,postoperative period,prednisone,prevalence,rapamycin,risk assessment,risk factor,streptomycin,tacrolimus,teicoplanin,thymocyte antibody,thymoglobulin,urinary tract infection,vancomycin,vancomycin resistant Enterococcus",NA,{Prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus fecal colonization among kidney transplant patients},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l44336325 http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-6-133 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=14712334{\&}id=doi:10.1186{\%}2f1471-2334-6-133{\&}atitle=prevalence+of+vanco,6,2006,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,maybe,brooke,maybe,mushtaq,mushtaq,mushtaq,yes,md_3.csv,NA,NA,md_3_1.mex,yes,journal

With the emergence of drug-resistant GC in the past 40 years, treatment options have become very limited. Hence, the U.S. Department of Defense has launched a GC resistance surveillance network in 8 countries; preliminary results are reported from the United States, Djibouti, Ghana, Kenya, and Peru. Methods: Patients with urethritis, cervicitis or vaginitis symptoms were recruited at participating clinics serving military personnel and beneficiaries, civilians, and at-risk groups of men who have sex with men and female commercial sex workers. Urethral swabs were collected from men; urethral or vaginal swabs from women; diagnosis was done using culture identification, nucleic acid amplification testing, and real-time PCR. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) was conducted on GC positive isolates using real-time PCR, disc diffusion, and E-test strip methods. Results: Overall, 108 (6{\%}) of 1,694 enrolled subjects tested positive for GC. Prevalence was found to be highest in Kenya where 33 (38{\%}) of 86 patients were positive and was lowest in Peru where only 30 (2{\%}) of 1,296 patients were positive. AST results were available on 66 GC positives; resistance to at least three antibiotics was observed across all overseas sites. Greatest variability in resistance was noted in Djibouti as follows: penicillin (100{\%}), tetracycline (88{\%}), ciprofloxacin (38{\%}), levofloxacin (17{\%}), cefepime (13{\%}), and ceftriaxone (13{\%}). High-level resistance (100{\%}) was also noted in Ghana to ciprofloxacin, penicillin, and tetracycline. Conclusion: These findings provide evidence of emerging drug-resistant GC in several regions of the world; the resistance found against third-generation cephalosporin in Djibouti is especially noteworthy.

2597,yes,brennan2013,article,"BACKGROUND: Community-associated meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) was first reported in remote Australian Aboriginal communities. It is a prominent clinical pathogen in northern Australia with potential for transmission within the local hospital setting. AIM: To determine epidemiological characteristics of S. aureus carriage within the Royal Darwin Hospital. METHODS: We screened two patient groups: an 'admission group' recruited within 48 h of admission; and an 'inpatient group' recruited five or more days after admission. S. aureus isolates were characterized by antibiotic susceptibility testing and genotyped by a multi-locus sequence type-based high-resolution melting scheme. FINDINGS: S. aureus carriage on admission was 30.7{\%} of 225 compared with 34.8{\%} among 201 inpatients, with MRSA carriage of 2.2{\%} and 18.9{\%} respectively. We isolated CA-MRSA from 0.9{\%} and 10.4{\%}, and healthcare-associated (HCA)-MRSA from 1.3{\%} and 9.0{\%} of the admission and inpatient groups, respectively.

In total, 49 strains (24 P. aeruginosa and 25 A. baumannii) were isolated, including 21 P. aeruginosa and 22 A. baumannii isolates (87.75{\%}) resistant to imipenem (minimum inhibitory concentrations {\textgreater}/=16 mug/ml). The blaVIM-2 gene was detected in 19 P. aeruginosa isolates. All imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates showed the presence of OprD mutations. Acquired OXA-carbapenemase-encoding genes were present in all A. baumannii isolates: blaOXA-23 (n=19) and blaOXA-24 (n=3). Finally, a total of 13 and 17 different sequence types were assigned to the 21 P. aeruginosa and the 22 A. baumannii carbapenem-resistant isolates, respectively. This study is the first report describing imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii isolated from patients in Libya. We report the first case of co-occurrence of blaVIM-2 with oprD porin loss in identical isolates of P. aeruginosa in Libya and demonstrate that these oprD mutations can be used as a tool to study the clonality in P. aeruginosa isolates.

5800,yes,eldholm2014,article,"BACKGROUND: Mycobacterium tuberculosis is characterized by a low mutation rate and a lack of genetic recombination. Yet, the rise of extensively resistant strains paints a picture of a microbe with an impressive adaptive potential. Here we describe the first documented case of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis evolved from a susceptible ancestor within a single patient. RESULTS: Genome sequences of nine serial M. tuberculosis isolates from the same patient uncovered a dramatic turnover of competing lineages driven by the emergence, and subsequent fixation or loss of single nucleotide polymorphisms. For most drugs, resistance arose through independent emergence of mutations in more than one clone, of which only one ultimately prevailed as the clone carrying it expanded, displacing the other clones in the process. The vast majority of mutations identified over 3.5 years were either involved in drug resistance or hitchhiking in the genetic background of these. Additionally, RNA-sequencing of isolates grown in the absence of drug challenge revealed that the efflux-associated iniBAC operon was up-regulated over time, whereas down-regulated genes include those involved in mycolic acid synthesis. CONCLUSIONS: We observed both rapid acquisitions of resistance to antimicrobial compounds mediated by individual mutations as well as a gradual increase in fitness in the presence of antibiotics, likely driven by stable gene expression reprogramming. The rapid turnover of resistance mutations and hitchhiking neutral mutations has major implications for inferring tuberculosis transmission events in situations where drug resistance evolves within transmission chains.",V Eldholm and G Norheim and B {von der Lippe} and W Kinander and U R Dahle and D A Caugant and T Manns\aaker and A T Mengshoel and A M Dyrhol-Riise and F Balloux and T Mannsaker and A T Mengshoel and A M Dyrhol-Riise and F Balloux,1474-7596,Genome Biol,",*Evolution,*High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing,Anti-Infective Agents/therapeutic use,Bacterial,Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis/*genetics/,Genome,Humans,Molecular,Mutation,Mycobacterium tuberculosis,Mycobacterium tuberculosis/*genetics/pathogenicity,Phylogeny,Polymorphism,Single Nucleotide,antiinfective agent,bacterial genome,extensively drug resistant tuberculosis,genetics,high throughput sequencing,human,microbiology,molecular evolution,mutation,pathogenicity,phylogeny,single nucleotide polymorphism",490,{Evolution of extensively drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis from a susceptible ancestor in a single patient},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l609751860 http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13059-014-0490-3 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=1474760x{\&}id=doi:10.1186{\%}2fs13059-014-0490-3{\&}atitle=evolution+of+e,15,2014,11,"from duplicate 1 (evolution of extensively drug-resistant mycobacterium tuberculosis from a susceptible ancestor in a single patient - eldholm, v; norheim, g; von der lippe, b; kinander, w; dahle, u r; caugant, d a; mannsaker, t; mengshoel, a t; dyrhol-riise, a m; balloux, f)1474-760xeldholm, vegardnorheim, gunnsteinvon der lippe, bentkinander, wibekedahle, ulf rcaugant, dominique amannsaker, turidmengshoel, anne torunndyrhol-riise, anne maballoux, francoisjournal articleresearch support, non-u.s. gov'tenglandgenome biol. 2014 nov 7;15(11):490. doi: 10.1186/s13059-014-0490-3.",10.1186/s13059-014-0490-3,11/25/14,eng,25418686,maybe,jake,yes,zach,zach,mushtaq,yes,md_3.csv,NA,NA,md_3_1.mex,yes,journal

This study describes the clonal spread of a unique strain of MR-MP within a single family. On January 23, 2015, nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum samples were collected from the index case (a 9-year-old girl) in southern Italy. The patient had pneumonia and was initially treated with clarithromycin. MR-MP infection was suspected due to prolonged symptoms despite appropriate antibiotic therapy. Two further cases of pneumonia occurred in relatives (a 7-year-old cousin and the 36-year-old mother of the index case); therefore, respiratory samples were also collected from other family members. Sequence analysis identified mutations associated with resistance to macrolides. Both P1 major adhesion protein typing and multiple loci variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) typing were performed to assess the relatedness of the strains. The index case, the cousin, the mother, and another 4 family members (twin siblings of the index case, a 3-year-old cousin, and the grandmother) were positive for MR-MP. All strains harbored the mutation A2063G, had the same P1 subtype (1), and were MLVA (7/4/ 5/7/2) type Z. In addition, the index case's aunt (31 years of age and the probable source of infection) harbored an M pneumoniae strain with the same molecular profile; however, this strain was susceptible to macrolides. This cluster of MR-MP infection/carriage caused by a clonal strain suggests a high transmission rate within this family and highlights the need for increased awareness among clinicians regarding the circulation of MR-MP.

23112,yes,yoo2012,article,"Objectives: Cases of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae are rare but their incidence is increasing in Korean hospitals. Various types of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, mostly Klebsiella pneumoniae, KPC-2, NDM-1, IMP-1, and VIM-2, were detected during a lab-based investigation in Korea. New Delhi metallo-betalactamase 1(NDM-1) -producing E. coli was first detected in one hospital in December 2011. Methods: Antimicrobial susceptibility tests and the MHT were performed according to CLSI methods and an imipenem disk synergy test was performed. NDM-1 genotype and other resistant genes were confirmed by PCR and sequencing using specific primers. For epidemiological analysis, PFGE types were determined by Xba-I restriction, and phylogenetic group PCR and MLST were performed. Results: One NDM-1-producing E. coli was isolated from a urine culture, and three isolates were recovered after surveillance of stool cultures from inpatients on the same ward. This hospital performed specific medical examinations for foreign patients. All patients were hospitalized 1-7 months before NDM-1 was isolated without history of overseas travel or medication. All the NDM-1-producing isolates were resistant to imipenem, meropenem, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, amikacin, ceftazidime, and cefotaxime, but were susceptible to colistin and tigecycline. TEM, SHV, CTX-M-15, DHA-1, OXA-1 genes were detected. PFGE analysis showed 98{\%} similarity, indicating clonality. All isolates belonged to phylogenetic group B1, ST101, which is a rare sequence type in Korea. Conclusion: This is the first case of NDM-1-producing E. coli in Korea. All isolates were identified from the four patients sharing the room. The transmission route of the organism was determined to be personal contact among the patients in the hospital, although the origin was not clear. However, E. coli B1-ST101 was reported as the major international clone of NDM-1-producing E. coli from England, Pakistan, Canada, Australia, and after considering the patients' epidemiological data, it was suspected that this organism was imported.

20371,yes,taj-aldeen2013,article,"Background: Nocardia species are rare, opportunistic organisms that cause disease in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals. Objective: To investigate the clinical presentations of various Nocardia infections based on the 16S ribosomal RNA gene of the isolate, as well as related risk factors and susceptibility patterns to antimicrobial agents Methods: Thirteen patients with a diagnosis of nocardiosis were included in the present study. Seven Nocardia species were identified by 16S ribosomal RNA. Susceptibility testing was performed using six antimicrobial agents. Results: Five patients were immunocompromised, and eight were immunocompetent with predisposing factors including cystic fibrosis, tuberculosis and ophthalmic infections. Nocardia caused pulmonary infections in eight patients (61.5{\%}), invasive systemic infections in three patients (23{\%}) and local (ophthalmic) infections in two patients (15.4{\%}). In the patients with pulmonary disease, nocardiosis was caused by six species (Nocardia cyriacigeorgica, Nocardia otitidiscaviarum, Nocardia farcinica, Nocardia carnea, Nocardia testacea and Nocardia asiatica). The seventh species identified in the present study was Nocardia crassostreae. Discussion: N crassostreae is a multidrug-resistant organism that was reported to be an emerging human pathogen causing invasive nocardiosis in a patient with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. N farcinica was isolated from blood in a patient with breast cancer. None of the Nocardia isolates were resistant to linezolid. One N otitidiscaviarum isolate was a multidrug-resistant organism. All patients in the present study were treated with the appropriate antibiotics and their condition resolved without further sequelae. Conclusions: The present study is the first report on N crassostreae as a human pathogen. The detection of multidrug-resistant species necessitate molecular identification and susceptibility testing, and should be performed for all Nocardia infections.

19559,yes,snyder2012,article,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Antimicrobial-resistant bacteria (ARB) including resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, and Gram-negative bacteria have the potential to cause serious infections among patients requiring chronic hemodialysis (CHD). The purpose of this article is to review novel ARB, which have emerged in this patient population, their mechanisms of transmission, and preventive efforts aimed at limiting their dissemination. RECENT FINDINGS: New strains of ARB, including community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus, S. aureus strains with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin, vancomycin-resistant S. aureus and multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (MDRGN), are emerging among the CHD population. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase Gram-negative bacteria (ESBLGN) are among the most common MDRGN strains. These ESBLGN are resistant to the great majority of antimicrobials. The carbapenems remain the only optimal antimicrobial choice to treat ESBLGN infections. Intrafacility spread of ARB in dialysis units occurs between patients through contaminated hands and clothes of healthcare workers (HCWs), as well as contaminated inanimate surfaces. Spread of ARB to family members of both patients and HCWs has also been documented. SUMMARY: Colonization and infection with ARB continues to present a significant threat to patients receiving CHD.

Using a comprehensive strain biobank spanning 3 decades, we sought to determine the prevalence and stability of chronic P. aeruginosa infection in an adult population. P. aeruginosa isolates from sputum samples collected at initial enrollment in our adult clinic and at the most recent clinic visit were examined by a combination of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing and compared against a collection of established transmissible and local non-CF bronchiectasis (nCFB) isolates. A total of 372 isolates from 107 patients, spanning 674 patient-years, including 66 patients with matched isolates from initial and final encounters, were screened. A novel clone with increased antibacterial resistance, termed the prairie epidemic strain (PES), was found in 29{\%} (31/107 patients) of chronically infected patients referred from multiple prairie-based CF centers. This isolate was not found in those diagnosed with CF as adults or in a control population with nCFB. While 90{\%} (60/66 patients) of patients had stable infection over a mean of 10.8 years, five patients experienced strain displacement of unique isolates, with PES occurring within 2 years of transitioning to adult care. PES has been present in our cohort since at least 1987, is unique to CF, generally establishes chronic infection during childhood, and has been found in patients at the time of transition of patients from multiple prairie-based CF clinics, suggesting broad endemicity.

The study included 13 K. penumoniae strains isolated from patients admitted to the Amiri hospital of Kuwait. The production of ESBL in all strains was confirmed by Vitek system and E-test. All the ESBL genes were amplified by PCR and examined by DNA sequencing. All these ESBL-positive isolates were resistant to ceftazidime and cefotaxime. DNA sequencing revealed an A815G point mutation in the bla (SHV )gene causing an asparagine (AAT) to aspartic acid (GAT) mutation at position 253 of the enzyme.

1359,yes,bakour2014,article,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular support of resistance to carbapenems, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones in Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates collected from Yemen hospital. METHODS: Three A. baumannii were isolated in February 2013 from three patients hospitalized at Al-Thawra University Hospital in Sana'a, Yemen. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed using the disk diffusion and E-test methods. Carbapenemase production was carried out by the modified Hodge test (MHT) and imipenem-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) methods. Carbapenem, aminoglycoside, and fluoroquinolone resistance determinants were studied by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. The epidemiological relatedness of the three strains was studied using multilocus sequence typing (MLST). RESULTS: The isolates were resistant to almost all antibiotics tested with very high imipenem, amikacin, and ciprofloxacin minimum inhibitory concentrations ({\textgreater}32, {\textgreater}256, and {\textgreater}32 mg/L, respectively). The microbiological tests showed that the three A. baumannii were MHT positive, besides, the activity of beta-lactamases was not inhibited by EDTA. All the three isolates contained the naturally occurring bla(OXA-51)-like gene and the bla(OXA-23)-like carbapenemase-encoding gene. The 16S rRNA methylase armA gene was detected in the three isolates. In addition, screening for genes encoding the aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (AMEs) demonstrated that one isolate contained the acetyltransferase gene aac(6')-Ib. Fluoroquinolone resistance was associated with a single mutation Ser83Leu in the quinolone resistance determining region of the gyrA gene in all isolates.

We describe a 2.5- year-old girl with XDR-pulmonary TB and an 18-monthold boy with pre-XDR-central nervous system TB. Patients received individualized treatment with second-line anti-TB agents based on genotypic and phenotypic drug susceptibility testing results. Both children achieved culture conversion 3 months and 1 month after treatment initiation, respectively. The child with XDR-pulmonary TB showed evidence of cure while treatment adverse events were managed without treatment interruption. The child with pre-XDR-central nervous system TB after 6-month hospitalization with multiple infectious complications had a dismal end due to hepatic insufficiency possibly related to anti-TB treatment. This is the first report of children with pre-XDR and XDR TB in Greece, emphasizing the public health dimensions and management complexity of XDR TB. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2012.",A Katragkou and C Antachopoulos and E Hatziagorou and M Sdougka and E Roilides and J Tsanakas,"0340-6199

Patients and Methods: Prospective study involving anemic/dyspeptic adult patients with positive 13C Urea Breath Test (UBT), which were divided in two groups: A-no previous Hp treatment (primary resistance); B-previous, failed, Hp treatment (secondary resistance). All patients were submitted to upper digestive endoscopy with biopsies for isolation of Hp. Genotyping and antibiotic susceptibility were determined. Patients received standard treatment protocol (Group APantoprazol + Amoxicillin + Clarithromycin, 14 days; Group B-Pantoprazol + Amoxicillin + Levofloxacin, 10 days). Hp eradication was assessed with UBT after 8-12 weeks. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS v17.0. Results: Ninety eight patients (Male/Female-28/70; mean age-42 Â¬Â± 14 years; Groups A/B-59/39) completed the protocol. Eradication was successful in 62.2{\%} (Group A-71.2{\%}; Group B-48.7{\%}; p = .025). Significant differences (p {\textless} .05) between both groups (Group A-Group B) for: tobacco use (11.9{\%}-28.2{\%}), alcohol use (22{\%}-41{\%}), 23S rRNA gene mutation A2143G (15.3{\%}-79.5{\%}) and genotype VacA s1b (39{\%}-17.9{\%}). All Hp isolates were susceptible to tetracycline and amoxicillin but 49{\%} were resistant to clarithromycin (22{\%}-89.7{\%}; p {\textless} .0001), 42.9{\%} to metronidazole (30.5{\%}-61.5{\%}; p = .002) and 29.6{\%} to levofloxacin (25.4{\%}-35.9{\%}; ns). Conclusions: High prevalence of primary and secondary resistance of Hp to clarithromycin, metronidazole and levofloxacin were observed in our country.

Cultures grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), resistant to fluoroquinolone antibiotics. The infections responded to topical vancomycin and resolved bilaterally over 3 weeks. Three months postoperatively, the uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) was 20/20 in the right eye and 20/25 in the left eye; the best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BSCVA) was 20/20 in both eyes. During the course of treatment, the patient reported chronic intermittent prophylactic use of oral ciprofloxacin. While fluoroquinolones typically provide excellent postoperative coverage, Staphylococcus organisms have a growing antibiotic resistance to fluoroquinolones, and MRSA may become a more prevalent organism in corneal infections. Chronic subtherapeutic fluoroquinolone use can increase the mutational resistance of Staphylococcus to fluoroquinolone and methicillin. The patient's frequent hospital visits placed her at high risk for MRSA colonization.

From a total of 78 consecutive non-repetitive Acinetobacter spp. isolates from patients with blood infections, 61 were carbapenem resistant, which were positive for blaOXA-51-like (96.7{\%}), blaOXA-23-like (77{\%}), blaOXA-58-like (8.1{\%}) and blaOXA-40-like genes (32.8{\%}) by multiplex PCR. The isolates were identified as A. baumannii (n559) and Acinetobacter nosocomialis (n52). Also, we found a case of Acinetobacter junii, causing bacteraemia, that possessed the IMP gene. High levels of resistance were observed to fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, tigecycline and to the beta-lactam antibiotics, including piperacillin/tazobactam and ampicillin/sulbactam. ISAba1 was present in 96.7{\%} of all Acinetobacter calcoaceticusâÃÃ¬baumannii complex (Acb) isolates. Also, 33 (54.1{\%}) and 23 (37.7{\%}) isolates harboured ISAba1 upstream of blaOXA-23-like and blaOXA-51-like genes, respectively, though this was not observed in A. nosocomialis isolates. No relationship was observed between the presence of ISAba1 upstream of oxacillinase genes and the level of carbapenem resistance in all Acb isolates. Only two genes encoding metallo-beta-lactamase (VIM, SPM) were detected in all Acb isolates. This suggests that carbapenem resistance in blood-isolate Acb is mostly due to the presence of acquired carbapenemases.

Antimicrobial resistance leads to treatment failure of hospital infections caused by E. coli. Production of extended-spectrum $\beta$-lactamases (ESBLs) is one of the major causes of antibiotic resistance in these bacteria. This study aimed to investigate the frequency of blaTEM and blaCTX-M genes in ESBL-producing E. coli strains isolated from clinical specimens of patients admitted to six hospitals in the north of Iran. A total of 160 E. coli strains were isolated from various clinical samples of hospitalised patients. Antibiotic resistance patterns were determined by the KirbyâÃÃ¬Bauer disk diffusion method. The double-disk phenotypic confirmatory test was carried out amongst $\beta$-lactam-resistant isolates to detect ESBL-producing strains. Plasmid DNA of ESBL-producing strains was extracted and subjected to PCR for detection of the blaTEM and blaCTX-M genes, and isolates were extensively verified by sequencing. The highest resistance rate was to amoxicillin; all E. coli isolates (100{\%}) were susceptible to imipenem. Amongst the 160 clinical E. coli isolates, 83 (51.9{\%}) were ESBL-positive, of which 27 (32.5{\%}) and 72 (86.7{\%}) were positive for blaTEM and blaCTX-M, respectively. This study is the first report of an ESBL phenotype disseminated in hospitals in the north of Iran.

18777,maybe,sekar2012,article,"Objectives: Acquired carbapenamases confer extensive antibiotic resistance in Enterobacteriaceae.The emergence and spread of New Delhi metallobetalactamases-1 (NDM-1) is a cause for concern. This study was undertaken to detect the production of NDM-1 metallobetalactamase (MBL) in Enterobacteriaceae at a tertiary care centre in India. Methods: One hundred and eleven clinically significant Enterobacteriaceae resistant to one of the cephalosporins subclass III were collected during the period April-October 2010. They included Klebsiella pneumoniae -52, Escherichia coli -25, Citrobacter freundii- 16, Enterobacter cloacae -16 and Providencia rettgeri -2, isolated from blood (23), respiratory secretions (24), exudative specimens (19) and urine (45) of patients in Intensive care units (ICU) and non-ICU settings. Susceptibility to imipenem and meropenem was performed by disc diffusion and Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determined by broth microdilution with suitable controls. Results were interpreted according to CLSI January 2011 guidelines. Carbapenamase production was screened by Modified Hodge test (MHT) and MBL production by inhibitor potentiated disk diffusion tests with ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) .The isolates were subjected to Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of blaNDM-1.Gene sequencing was performed. Results: BlaNDM-1 was detected in 64 isolates. While the MHT was positive in 57 of them, the MBL screening test was positive in 43. The sensitivity of these tests were 89.1{\%} and 79.6{\%} .MIC90 values for imipenem and meropenem were 4 and 2 mg/L respectively. BlaNDM-1 positive isolates were from blood (17), exudative specimens (13), respiratory secretions (9) and urine (25). The majority of these isolates were K. pneumoniae (31), followed by E. coli (13), E. cloacae (10), C. freundii (9) and P. rettgeri (1). The NDM-1 producers were distributed equally between ICU and non- ICU patients. Twenty-seven isolates were susceptible to carbapenems as per CLSI 2011 interpretation. Conclusion: NDM-1 producing Enterobacteriaceae cause a multitude of infections both in ICU and non ICU settings. Screening tests have poor sensitivity for NDM-1 producers. Interpretation based on CLSI 2011 guidelines can lead to erroneous susceptibility report. Since the significance of presence of NDM-1 in isolates susceptible to carbapenem is unclear, the need for screening all Enterobacteriaceae with resistance to cephalosporins subclass III is to be considered.",U Sekar and S Amudhan and A Kamalanathan and S Balaraman,1198-743x,Clinical Microbiology and Infection,"Citrobacter freundii,Enterobacter cloacae,Enterobacteriaceae,Escherichia coli,India,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Providencia rettgeri,acid,antibiotic resistance,blood,bodily secretions,broth dilution,carbapenem,carbapenem derivative,cephalosporin derivative,disk diffusion,ethylenediamine,gene sequence,human,imipenem,infection,intensive care unit,meropenem,microbiology,minimum inhibitory concentration,patient,polymerase chain reaction,prevalence,screening,screening test,tertiary health care,urine",476,{Increasing prevalence of New Delhi metallobetalactamase-1 in Enterobacteriaceae: The challenge},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l70823439 http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-0691.2012.03802.x http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=1198743x{\&}id=doi:10.1111{\%}2fj.1469-0691.2012.03802.x{\&}atitle=i,18,2012,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,maybe,cale,no,zach,allison,mushtaq,yes,md_4.csv,NA,NA,md_4_1.mex,yes,journal

The present report describes fatal bacteremia due to multidrug-resistant A. baumannii in a post- ERCP patient. Case Presentation: An 85-year-old woman with a history of diverticulosis, hypertension, left hip arthroplasty and gout was admitted to our hospital with a 1-week history of jaundice, lethargy, confusion. Her initial vital signs were within normal ranges. Icteric sclera were noted on physical examinations and the rest was unremarkable. Significant findings on laboratory tests were white blood cell count 13,400/$\mu$L; total bilirubin 6.2 mg/dL; AST 248U/L; ALT 185 U/L; and alkaline phosphatase 617 U/L. A CT scan of the abdomen revealed a large obstructing stone and ascending cholangitis (Figure 1). Patient was empirically started on antibiotics. Patient underwent two ERCPs to extract stones. Biliary stent was placed during the second procedure. One day after the procedure, patient developed septic shock. Antibiotics were switched to intravenous meropenem and levofloxacin. She was intubated and required maximum vasopressor supports for refractory shock. Five out of 5 sets of blood cultures and bile culture grew multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Intravenous tigecycline was added on day 10 and parenteral colistin replaced meropenem after final sensitivity reports returned. Blood cultures drawn after administration of colistin remained sterile; however, the patient could not recover from septic shock. Discussion: Bacteremia is a rare but well-documented complication following endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). According to a recent prospective, observational study following a total of 2,052 ERCPs, 46 cases of bacteremia were detected after ERCP (incidence rate of 2.24/100). The most commonly isolated pathogens were Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococci. Acinetobacter baumannii is an aerobic gram-negative rod. It is an important pathogen of nosocomial infections including sepsis and ventilator-associated pneumonia. Management of Acinetobacter baumannii infections can be challenging to clinicians because of its resistance to common antibiotics. Colistin and tigecycline have been utilized in the treatment of resistant pathogens. Considering the significant nephrotoxicity of colistin and emerging resistance to tigecycline of A. baumannii as in our case, developing newer antibiotics against multidrug-resistant A. baumannii are needed. Also, gastroenterologists should take into consideration the risk of bacteremia and sepsis caused by hospital-acquired resistant pathogens whenever performing invasive procedures such as ERCP.

Carbapenem resistance mediated by metallo - $\beta$-lactamases (MBLs) remains uncommon in the United States, despite the worldwide emergence of this group of enzymes. Between March 2012 and May 2013,we detected MBL-producing P. aeruginosa in a university-affiliated health care system in northeast Ohio . We examined the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients, defined the resistance determinants and structure of the genetic element harboring the bla{\textless}inf{\textgreater}MBL{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}gene through genome sequencing, and typed MBL-producing P. aeruginosa isolates using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), repetitive sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR), and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Seven patients were affected that were hospitalized at three community hospitals, a long-term-care facility, and a tertiary care center; one of the patients died as a result of infection. Isolates belonged to sequence type 233 (ST233) and were extensively drug resistant (XDR), including resistance to all fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, and $\beta$-lactams; two isolates were nonsusceptible to colistin. The bla{\textless}inf{\textgreater}MBL{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}gene was identified as bla{\textless}inf{\textgreater}VIM-2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}contained within a class 1 integren (In559), similar to the cassette array previously detected in isolates from Norway, Russia, Taiwan, and Chicago, IL.

METHODS: An analytical case-control study was conducted over twelve months in 9 hospitals in Colombia. We collected isolates of E. coli, Klebsiella spp. and Proteus spp. from patients with community-onset UTI. The presence of ESBL, AmpC and KPC beta-lactamases were characterized by microbiological and molecular methods. The aim of this study was to determine factors related to the presence of these mechanisms of the resistance to third generation cephalosporins. RESULTS: A total of 325 isolates (287 E. coli, 29 Klebsiella spp. and 9 Proteus spp.) were included. The most frequent comorbidities among the patients were hypertension (n=82; 25.2{\%}) and diabetes mellitus (n=68; 20.9{\%}). Previous use of antimicrobials was found in 23{\%} of patients, and 29{\%} had a previous UTI.

These isolates were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-positive. We investigated whether this was due to interspecies transfer of resistance genes. METHODS: The MDR strains were typed by amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis. The plasmids from these strains were characterized by restriction fragment length polymorphism and the resistance genes were characterized by PCR and sequence analysis. RESULTS: The strains were genetically unrelated and contained identical plasmids with ESBL genes. CONCLUSIONS: We identified an outbreak of plasmid-mediated ESBL genes during SDD treatment in the ICU. The use of third-generation cephalosporins in SDD is associated with the emergence of ESBLs.

Among the causative microorganisms of acute diarrheal diseases are those of Aeromonas genus, recognized as second risk emerging pathogens. OBJECTIVES: To determine the most frequently isolated Aeromonas species in fecal samples from acute diarrheal patients and their antimicrobial susceptibility. METHODS: The Bauer-Kirby's method allowed identifying the susceptibility to several antimicrobials of 100 isolated samples coming from the provincial hygiene and epidemiology centers during 2007 and 2008. RESULTS: Identification of the species was accomplished in 67{\%} of isolates, being A. caviae (33{\%}) y A. hydrophila (29{\%}) the predominant species. It was demonstrated that 100{\%} of isolates got resistant to at least one of the studied antimicrobials.

17509,yes,revathi2013,article,"BACKGROUND: The emergence of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) was observed in a Kenyan hospital from 2009 to 2010. Further investigation of the dissemination of CRAB isolates and the molecular characterization of associated resistance determinants were therefore performed. METHODS: Antibiotic susceptibilities were determined by broth microdilution and Etest. Metallo-beta-lactamases were detected by Etest method. Clonal relationships were studied by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). beta-Lactam and aminoglycoside resistance determinants and the clonal relatedness to widespread European clones were studied by PCR and sequencing. RESULTS: Sixteen CRAB isolates from 10 patients possessed six pulsotypes; half of the isolates belonged to the European clone II (ECII) lineage. ECII strains were typed as MLST sequence type 2 (ST2) and ST109, and non-ECII strains as ST25 and ST113. All isolates harbored ISAba1-blaOXA-23, blaOXA-51-like, blaADC, and class 1 integron, including one that also harbored blaNDM-1.

6097,yes,falgenhauer2016,article,"Background: Multidrug resistant Enterobacteriaceae, especially those harbouring extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) or carbapenemases, are high risk pathogens, in particular for patients with an impaired immune system. A relevant treatment option, especially for infections involving carbapenemase-encoding Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), is the polypeptide antibiotic colistin. However, colistin resistance in bacteria can occur, but was mediated by chromosomal mutations so far. Recently, a plasmid encoded, transferable resistance gene called mcr-1 was identified in China. This study was performed to investigate the presence of mcr-1 in German ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae and CRE isolated from 2010 to 2014. Materials and Methods: Whole genome sequencing of 600 Enterobacteriaceae isolates from different sources (human, livestock, companion animal, environment, food), was performed using Illumina MiSeq. The sequencing data was deposited in a local database, which was searched for the presence of the mcr-1 gene using blastn. The genetic environment of the mcr-1 gene was investigated using ISFinder and blastn. Conjugation experiments were performed to identify the transfer rates of the mcr-1-encoding plasmids. Result: Nine Escherichia coli isolates harboured the mcr-1 gene. Four isolates, originating from swine samples, were blaCTX-M-1 positive. Four other isolates had been isolated from food and harboured either a blaCTX-M-1, blaCTX-M-14, blaCTX-M-15 or a blaTEM-52 ESBL gene. The ninth isolate originated from a human patient sample, harbouring a blaKPC-2 carbapenemase gene. Colistin resistance was transferable to a susceptible E. coli recipient strain by conjugation, confirming plasmidic location. Conjugation rates ranged from 10-1 to 10-7 cells per recipient. The genetic environment of mcr-1 was diverse, including variants with an upstream copy of the insertion sequence ISApl1, as well as variants which did not harbour any ISApl1. All isolates harboured mcr-1 on plasmids of other incompatibility groups (IncX4 or IncHI2 instead of IncI2) as described in the original publication from China (Liu et al., 2015). Conclusion: The colistin resistance gene mcr-1 is present in Germany at least since the year 2010, which was the earliest isolation time point of mcr-1 positive isolates. The presence of a human CRE isolate with the mcr-1 gene is clearly worrisome, as this represents a further reduction of treatment options on the way to a postantibiotic era. The presence of mcr-1 in a larger set of isolates (from other locations, e.g. environment) has to be tested to investigate the epidemiology of the mcr-1 gene in Germany in greater detail.",L Falgenhauer and S E Waezsada and Y Yao and K Gwozdzinski and J Schmiedel and R Bauerfeind and G B Michael and S Schwarz and Y Pfeifer and G Werner and N Roschanski and U Roesler and A Irrgang and B Guerra and A KâÂ§sbohrer and M Kaase and L Kreienbrock and A Goesmann and C Imirzalioglu and T Chakraborty,1618-0607,International Journal of Medical Microbiology,"China,Escherichia coli,Germany,animal experiment,animal tissue,carbapenemase,colistin,conjugation,data base,endogenous compound,extended spectrum beta lactamase,gene insertion sequence,human,human versus animal comparison,livestock,nonhuman,pig,plasmid,publication,recipient,whole genome sequencing",133,{Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and carbapenemase encoding Enterobacteriaceae isolates harbouring the novel mcr-1 gene},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l614104675 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmm.2016.11.008 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=16180607{\&}id=doi:10.1016{\%}2fj.ijmm.2016.11.008{\&}atitle=extended-spe,306,2016,8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,yes,brooke,yes,zach,zach,mushtaq,no,md_4.csv,only gave me author and absract index,NA,NA,no,journal

15986,yes,pario2011,article,"Introduction: Diabetic foot ulcers are a common cause of morbidity and mortality in Mulago Hospital. The presence and severity of peripheral neuropathy and peripheral arterial disease determines treatment options and ulcer outcome. Infection of diabetic foot ulcers is a commonly encountered problem and is an important cause of morbidity, prolonged hospital admission and amputations. Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) are emerging in diabetic foot infections. The clinical presentation and bacteriological profile of diabetic foot ulcers in Mulago Hospital is not known. Aims: To describe the clinical presentation of peripheral neuropathy and peripheral arterial disease, and to identify the common bacterial isolates from diabetic foot ulcers and their susceptibility patterns to commonly used antibiotics in Mulago Hospital. Methods: This was prospective study involving 60 patients with diabetic foot ulcers admitted to the endocrinology unit at Mulago Hospital between July and December 2010. Cases were recruited consecutively after provision of written consent. The socio-demographics of the patients and relevant clinical history on the diabetic foot ulcers were noted. Both feet were examined for peripheral neuropathy and peripheral arterial disease using standard clinical methods. Deep-tissue swabs from the ulcers were taken for both aerobic and anaerobic cultures and for susceptibility tests, using standard microbiological methods. Results: The majority (56.7{\%}) of the patients had neuro-ischaemic foot ulcers, followed by ischaemic and neuropathic ulcers in equal proportions (18.3{\%}) and unclassified (no features of neuropathy and ischaemia) (6.7{\%}). Gram-negative aerobes were most frequently isolated (80.6{\%}), followed by gram-positive aerobes (19.4{\%}). No anaerobe was isolated. Polymicrobial infection was 41.7{\%}, and 84{\%} of the isolates were positive for MDROs. ESBL production and MRSA were noted in 43.5 and 60{\%} of the bacterial isolates, respectively. Conclusion: Diabetic foot ulcers in this population of patients were mostly neuro-ischaemic with varying severity of neuropathy. Most ulcers occurred in the setting of normal dorsalis artery pulse and impaired/absent posterior tibial artery pulse. Infection was mostly aerobic Gram-negative with a high prevalence of MDROs. Emerging ESBL and MRSA were noted in diabetic foot infections.

The aim of this study was to assess the mechanism of high-level carbapenem resistance in an A. baumannii isolate imported to a Czech hospital. Methods: Strain ANC 4097, which had been imported from Egypt, was recovered from the sputum of a patient hospitalized in the Czech Republic in July 2011. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by disc diffusion while the production of metallo-{\ss}-lactamases was assessed using Etest MBL strips. Resistance genes were characterized by PCR and sequencing. The location and genetic background of blaNDM-1 were analyzed by hybridization of genomic DNA with a blaNDM-like probe and primer walking strategy. The strain was genotyped by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Results: ANC 4097 belonged to sequence type (ST) 1 which is typical of the âÃÃºEuropean clone IâÃÃ¹ epidemic lineage. It showed high level resistance to all {\ss}-lactams and other antimicrobial agents except colistin, tobramycin, netilmicin, doxycycline and tigecycline. The positive MBL test suggested the production of a metallo-{\ss}-lactamase. The strain harboured the blaNDM-1, blaOXA-23 and intrinsic blaOXA- 51-like carbapenemase genes. Insertion sequence ISAba1 was identified upstream of the blaOXA-23 and blaOXA-51-like genes. The blaNDM- 1 gene was located onto the chromosome of ANC 4097 and inside composite transposon Tn125. Conclusions: This study reports on the first blaNDM-1 positive A. baumannii strain in the Czech Republic.

Despite worldwide increasing rate of multidrug resistant Enterococci colonization and infection among hospitalized patients, there is scarcity of data from resource limited setting. The present study aimed at determining the antimicrobial resistance profile of Enterococcus species from intestinal tracts of hospitalized patients in Jimma, Ethiopia. METHODS: The study was conducted among hospitalized patients at Jimma University Specialized Hospital, from January to July 2013. Fecal samples were collected and processed for bacterial isolation and susceptibility testing to antimicrobial agents. Stool samples were inoculated onto enterococcus selective media (Bile Esculin azide agar plate) with and without 6 microg/ml of vancomycin. The isolates were identified to genus and species level by cultural characteristics, Gram's stain, catalase test, growth in 6.5{\%} NaCl broth, growth at 45 degrees C, motility test and by using API 20 Streptococcus system. Sensitivity testing was done using Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. Minimum inhibitory concentrations for vancomycin were determined using E-test strips. RESULT: Overall, Enterococci were isolated from 114 (76{\%}) of the study subjects. The isolates were Enterococcus faecium (35.1{\%}) followed by Enterococcus faecalis (29.8{\%}), Enterococcus gallinarum (17.5{\%}), Enterococcus casseliflavus (8.8{\%}) and Enterococcus durans (8.8{\%}). Among 114 tested Enterococci isolates, 41 (36{\%}) were resistant to ampicillin, 62 (54.4{\%}) to streptomycin and 39 (34.2{\%}) to gentamycin. Other alternative antibiotics to treat mixed nosocomial infection caused by Enterococci also showed high rate of resistance in vitro: ciprofloxacin (50{\%} of resistance), norfloxacin (49.1{\%}), erythromycin (63.2{\%}), tetracycline (64.9{\%}), chloramphenicol (34.2{\%}), and nitrofrantoin (32.4{\%}). Multiple drug resistance was observed among 89.5{\%} of E. faecium and E. faecalis. Vancomycin resistant Enterococci were observed in 5{\%} of E. faecium isolates. CONCLUSION: This study reveals high rate of fecal colonization by multidrug-resistant Enterococci and prevalence of vancomycin resistance strains.

Methods: Strains: 14 MRSA isolates (O-1 through O-14) from outpatients at Srinagarind Hospital, Khon Kaen University, Thailand, collected between September 2005 and March 2006; 5 MRSA strains (I-1 through I-5) isolated from inpatients {\textgreater}72 hours after admission; Two MRSA strains from a nasal swab of a nurse (N-1) and from a pig with pneumonia (P-1). Antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined using the agar dilution method. Molecular typing: Coagulase types, agr types, spa types, SCCmec types were determined as described by previously. Carriages of genes for heavy metal resistance (mer and copA) and exfoliative toxin a, b, d (eta, etb, etd), PVL (lukS-PV, lukF-PV) and TSST (tsst-1)were examined by PCR. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of SmaI-digested chromosomal DNA was performed using a contour-clamped homogeneous electric field mapper system. Nucleotide sequences in and aroundthe SCCmec elementand coa gene were determined using the DNA fragments amplified with PCRs and long-range PCRs. Results: All MRSA isolates from the outpatients and inpatients were multidrug-resistant (resistant toâÃ¢â¢3 classes of antimicrobials). Among the 14 isolates fromthe outpatients, the O-2 strain (JCSC6690) carried type IX SCCmec and belonged to the agr II, coagulase XIc, spa type t337 and ST9. The other 13 isolates from the outpatients and 4 inpatients carried the type III SCCmec, belonging to agr I, coagulase IV, spa typet037 (except for one that was t233) and ST239. Nucleotide sequence determination revealed that the type IX SCCmec element in the O-2 strain was distinct from the type IX SCCmec, as previously identified in the ST398 strain (JCSC6943), since the identities of the ccrA and ccrB genes were 93 and 91{\%}, respectively, and that many open reading frames (ORFs) at the joining regions (the regions other than the mec and ccr gene complexes) were not homologous.

6306,yes,fernandez-natal2016,article,"Human infections associated with Corynebacterium kroppenstedtii are rarely reported, and this organism is usually described as antibiotic sensitive. Almost all published cases of C. kroppenstedtii infections have been associated with breast pathology in women and have been described in New Zealand, France, Canada, India and Japan. Here we describe the microbiologic characteristics of two strains isolated from two women diagnosed of granulomatous mastitis in Spain. One C. kroppenstedtii isolate was antibiotic sensitive while the other was multidrug resistant. Biochemical identification was possible using a wide battery of methods including API Coryne V2.0, API Strep, API NH, API NE, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and 16S rRNA gene amplification and sequencing. Antimicrobial susceptibility to 28 antibiotics as determined by Etest showed one isolate being sensitive to benzylpenicillin, ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin, gentamicin, vancomycin, clindamycin, tetracycline, linezolid and rifampin. The second isolate showed resistance to ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin, clindamycin, tetracycline and rifampin. The multidrug-resistant isolate contained the erm(X), tet(W), cmx, aphA1-IAB, strAB and sul1 resistance genes known from the R plasmid pJA144188 of Corynebacterium resistens. These genes were absent in the genome of the antibiotic-sensitive isolate.

21767,maybe,venugopal2007,article,"PURPOSE: To determine minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of various anti-tuberculosis drugs for Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) strains isolated from clinical samples. METHODS: Forty-nine human isolates of MAC were tested for susceptibility to nine chemotherapeutic agents. All isolates were from Indian patients suffering from chronic pulmonary mycobacteriosis. Drug susceptibility was performed both by agar dilution and MIC method. MIC values were analysed, both visually and by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader. RESULTS: More than 40{\%} of the MAC isolates were sensitive to ciprofloxacine (48.98{\%}), amikacin (46.94{\%}) and roxithromycin (42.86{\%}) by the MIC method. In contrast, the isolates showed high degree of resistance to the first line antituberculosis drugs: only 28.6{\%} were sensitive to rifampicine, 22.85{\%} to isoniazid and ethambutol each and 36.7{\%} were sensitive to streptomycin. In addition, 22.85{\%} of the strains were sensitive to clofazimine and 34.7{\%} to kanamycin. CONCLUSIONS: Results of the study confirm the suitability of the rapid broth micro dilution (MIC) method as a simple yet reliable method to assay for the drug susceptibility of nontuberculosis mycobacterium.",D Venugopal and S Kumar and M Isa and M Bose,"0255-0857 (print)

Since vancomycin is the most frequently-prescribed antibiotic for healthcare-associated MRSA infection, there is concern for development of vancomycin resistance. We report on a 61 year-old woman with history of previous successful treatments of MRSA bacteremia with vancomycin. She was later hospitalized for catheter-related MRSA bacteremia that persisted despite vancomycin treatment. The vancomycin minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was initially 1-2 microg/ml, suggesting susceptibility, but changed to 4 microg/ml. At this level, the organism was classified as a vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (VISA). Therapy was changed from vancomycin to daptomycin, and the patient's blood cultures were sterilized. High suspicion of VISA should be raised in MRSA-infected patients who fail or have a history of vancomycin therapy so that additional susceptibility testing and appropriate antibiotic therapy can be promptly commenced to reduce the morbidity associated with VISA infection.",S Chaiwongkarjohn and P Pramyothin and N Suwantarat and M J Bankowski and T Koyamatsu and S E Seifried and E F Bello,"0017-8594 (print)

He had recurrent episodes of infected hip caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and was treated with vancomycin. He underwent replacement operation of prosthesis. Cultures of joint fluid and joint tissue grew S. aureus. Vancomycin MIC as determined by a broth microdilution method was 4 microg/mL for the both isolates. The patient was treated with high enough doses of vancomycin to maintain serum trough concentrations at 20-25 microg/mL for 52 days and was discharged. The second patient was a 57 yr-old man with diabetes. He lost consciousness from drinking. After recovery of consciousness, he was diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia. MRSA and Acinetobacter baumannii were cultured from sputum and the patient was treated with vancomycin and meropenem. During hospitalization, bed sores developed in his ankle and back.

This study aimed to investigate the Mdm2 gene, clarithromycin resistance, and possible risk factors for Helicobacter pylori infection. Methods. Risk factors and clinical characteristics were analyzed, including patient demographic data, patient income, personal history, possible source of transmission, patient symptoms, endoscopic findings, patterns of clarithromycin resistance, and patterns of Mdm2 SNIP309. Results. Ingestion of pickled fish (OR = 11.27, 95{\%} CI = 4.31-29.45, p{\textless}0.0001), salt crab (OR = 8.83, 95{\%} CI = 1.99-39.14, p{\textless}0.001), and Papaya salad (OR = 8.73, 95{\%} CI = 4.54-16.79, p{\textless}0.01). The prevalence of clarithromycin resistance was 56{\%} (wild type, A2143/2142A, is 23.8{\%}; mutation, A2143/2142CG, is 35.7{\%}; wild type + mutation is 40.5{\%}). The genetic polymorphisms of Mdm2 SNIP309 were SNIP309 T/T homozygous in 78{\%}, SNIP309 G/T heterozygous in 19{\%}, and SNIP309 G/G homozygous in 3{\%}. Conclusion.

For empirical coverage of CA-MRSA in outpatients with skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) is recommended oral antibiotics including clindamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), a tetracycline (doxycycline or minocycline) and linezolid. However, susceptibility to these antibiotics is variable in different geographic regions, especially for clindamycin and macrolides. The aim of this study was to describe the incidence of CA-MRSA and level of non betalactam resistance in outpatients with SSTIs in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Methods: Prospective and observational study of CA-MRSA SSTIs in outpatients attended at the Infectious Diseases Department, Cosme Argerich Hospital (March 2010-October 2011). Susceptibility tests were performed by disk diffusion and Vitek 2 system (bioM{\'{e}}rieux) according to the CLSI. For clindamycin susceptibility the D-Test method was also performed. A phenotypic rule was applied and CAMRSA was defined as strains resistant to {\textless}3 of the following non- betalactams antibiotics: gentamicin, erythromycin, tetracycline, TMPSMX, rifampin and ciprofloxacin. Only one sample per patient was included. Results: Of a total of 99 isolates of S. aureus, 79{\%} (IC95 70-86) corresponded to CA-MRSA. Male sex: 63{\%}. The median age was 31 years (IQR 27-53). HIV-infected patients: 8{\%} (IC95{\%} 3-16). Clinical presentation included: cutaneous abscesses 44{\%}, furuncules 35{\%} and cellulitis 21{\%}.

Typhi, to understand the related epidemiological characteristics of typhoid fever and to provide evidence for the development of strategies, in Guangxi. METHODS: Data of typhoid fever from surveillance and reporting system between 1994 to 2013 was collected and statistically analyzed epidemiologically. The susceptibility of 475 S. Typhi isolates from patients on ten antibiotics was tested by broth micro-dilution method and minimum inhibition concentration was obtained and interpreted based on the CLSI standard. RESULTS: From 1994 to 2013, a total of 57 928 cases of typhoid fever were reported in Guangxi province with an annual incidence of 6.29/100 000 and mortality as 0.03{\%}. The higher incidence was observed in the population under 20 years of age. There was no significant difference on incidence between male and female, but farmers and students were among the hardest hit groups. More cases were seen from the northern part of the province. Cases appeared all year round with the peak from May to October. A total of 13 major outbreaks during 2001 to 2013 were reported and the main transmission route was water-borne. All the strains were sensitive to third generation cephalosporins cefotaxime and fluoroquinolones norfloxacin. The susceptibility rates to tetracycline, chloramphenicol, ampicillin and gentamicin was around 98{\%} but relative lower susceptible rate to ciprofloxacin was seen as 89.89{\%} . The lowest susceptibility was found for streptomycin and sulfamethoxazole agents, with the rates as 67.73{\%} and 65.89{\%} , respectively. One strain was found to have been resistant to ciprofloxacin and another 47 isolates with reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin. Twenty eight isolates were found to be resistant to multiple antibiotics and one displayed ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole tetracycline and nalidixic acid (ACSSxT-NAL) resistance profile. This was the first report in China. Multi-drug resistant strains were frequently isolated from small scale outbreaks of typhoid fever. CONCLUSION: The incidence of typhoid fever in Guangxi was still high and some strains showed multi-drug resistance and reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, indicating that the surveillance and monitor programs on drug resistance of S. Typhi should be strengthened, to prevent large scale outbreaks of typhoid fever in this province.",M Wang and B Kan and J Yang and M Lin and M Yan and J Zeng and Y Quan and H Liao and L Zhou and Z Jiang and D Huang,"0254-6450 (print)

19122,maybe,shibuya2012,article,"Backgrounds and Aims Since the late 1990s, community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) has emerged worldwide as a life-threatening pathogen that is primarily associated with soft-tissue infection of the skin in otherwise healthy children, adolescents, and athletes. It is also associated with severe systemic infections such as sepsis and necrotizing pneumonia. We analyzed the clinical pathology and infection control of CA-MRSA respiratory tract infection in a Japanese emergency hospital. Methods We screened CA-MRSA strains, isolated from the clinical laboratory of Tokyo Metropolitan Hiroo General Hospital between April 2007 and December 2010, based on the following conditions: strains confirmed as Staphylococcus aureus with minimal inhibitory concentration values for oxacillin, clindamycin, and levofloxacin of âÃ¢â¢4, âÃ¢Â§0.5 and âÃ¢Â§2 $\mu$g/mL, respectively. All screened strains were confirmed by identification of Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) and type IV SCCmec genes by PCR. We analyzed the clinical pathology of all CA-MRSA strains isolated from patient respiratory tract specimens. Results We confirmed 53 new CA-MRSA strains between April 2007 and December 2010; these accounted for 3.6{\%} of the total MRSA strains isolated during this period. Respiratory specimens were the source of 30 (56{\%}) strains, whereas skin and soft tissue specimens were the source of 12 (23{\%}) strains. The screened CA-MRSA strains were sensitive to anti-MRSA agents, cephems and quinolone. Of the 30 strains isolated from respiratory specimens, 22 strains (73.3{\%}) were considered as colonizers, and eight strains (26.7{\%}) were considered as causative microorganisms of respiratory tract infection. One strain of PVL-positive CA-MRSA was isolated from respiratory tract specimens during the study period. Conclusions A total of 0.5{\%} of all MRSA isolated at our hospital between April 2007 and December 2010 was CA-MRSA considered as causative microorganisms of respiratory tract infection. This ratio is smaller than that reported in the USA. The isolated CA-MRSA strains were sensitive to antimicrobial agents. Nevertheless, since CA-MRSA is associated with severe systemic infections such as sepsis and necrotizing pneumonia, factors affecting the incidence of CA-MRSA infection should be investigated.",Y Shibuya and S Okamoto and H Hiramoto and H Ohta and R Usui and T Enomoto,1073-449x,American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,"American,Japan,Japanese (people),Panton Valentine leukocidin,Staphylococcus aureus,adolescent,antiinfective agent,athlete,cephem derivative,child,clindamycin,clinical laboratory,community,gene,general hospital,hospital,human,infection,infection control,levofloxacin,methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus,methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus infect,microorganism,minimum inhibitory concentration,oxacillin,pathogenesis,pathology,patient,pneumonia,quinolone,respiratory system,respiratory tract infection,sepsis,skin,society,soft tissue,soft tissue infection",NA,{Clinical pathology and infection control of community-acquired methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus respiratory tract infection in a Japanese emergency hospital},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l71986316 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=1073449x{\&}id=doi:{\&}atitle=clinical+pathology+and+infection+control+of+community-acquired+methicillin-resistant+s,185,2012,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,maybe,brooke,no,zach,allison,mushtaq,no,md_4.csv,no access,NA,NA,no,journal

9060,maybe,huang2013e,article,"The genetic features of the antimicrobial resistance of a multidrug resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae strain harboring bla NDM-1 were investigated to increase our understanding of the evolution of NDM-1. The strain, KPX, came from a Taiwanese patient with a hospitalization history in New Delhi. Complete DNA sequencing was performed; and the genes responsible for antimicrobial resistance were systematically examined and isolated by library screening. KPX harbored two resistance plasmids, pKPX-1 and pKPX-2, which are 250-kb and 141-kb in size, respectively, with bla NDM-1 present on pKPX-1. The plasmid pKPX-1 contained genes associated with the IncR and IncF groups, while pKPX-2 belonged to the IncF family. Each plasmid carried multiple antimicrobial resistance genetic determinants. The gene responsible for resistance to carbapenems was found on pKPX-1 and that for resistance to aztreonam was found on pKPX-2. To our surprise, we discovered that bla NDM-1 exists on pKPX-1 as multiple copies in the form of tandem repeats. Amplification of bla NDM-1 was found to occur by duplication of an 8.6-kb unit, with the copy number of the repeat varying from colony to colony. This repeat sequence is identical to that of the pNDM-MAR except for two base substitutions. The copy number of bla NDM-1 of colonies under different conditions was assessed by Southern blotting and quantitative PCR. The bla NDM-1 sequence was maintained in the presence of the antimicrobial selection; however, removal of antimicrobial selection led to the emergence of susceptible bacterial populations with a reduced copy number or even the complete loss of the bla NDM-1 sequence. The dynamic nature of the NDM-1 sequence provides a strong argument for judicious use of the broad-spectrum antimicrobials in order to reduce the development and spread of antimicrobial resistance among pathogens.",T W Huang and T L Chen and Y T Chen and T L Lauderdale and T L Liao and Y T Lee and C P Chen and Y M Liu and A C Lin and Y H Chang and K M Wu and R Kirby and J F Lai and M C Tan and L K Siu and C M Chang and C P Fung and S F Tsai,1932-6203,PLoS ONE,",*DNA Copy Number Variations,Adult,Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology,Asian,Bacterial/chemistry/*genetics,Bacterial/drug effects/,Carbapenems/pharmacology,Colony Count,DNA,DNA sequence,Drug Resistance,Humans,India,Klebsiella Infections/drug therapy/microbiology,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Klebsiella pneumoniae/drug effects/enzymology/*gen,Male,Microbial,Multiple,Plasmids/*chemistry,Sequence Analysis,Tandem Repeat Sequences,adult,amikacin,ampicillin,antibiotic resistance,article,aztreonam,bacterial gene,bacterial strain,bacterium isolate,beta-Lactamases/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism,blaNDM 1 gene,carbapenem derivative,cefazolin,cefepime,cefotaxime,cefoxitin,ceftazidime,ceftriaxone,cefuroxime,chloramphenicol,ciprofloxacin,colistin,doripenem,ertapenem,gene amplification,gene dosage,gene duplication,gene library,gene loss,gentamicin,hospitalization,human,imipenem,levofloxacin,male,meropenem,metallo beta lactamase,minocycline,molecular dynamics,multidrug resistance,nalidixic acid,nonhuman,nucleic acid base substitution,piperacillin,plasmid,protein NDM 1,sultamicillin,tandem repeat,tetracycline,tigecycline,timentin,unclassified drug,unindexed drug",e62774,{Copy Number Change of the NDM-1 sequence in a multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolate},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l368833129 http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0062774 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=19326203{\&}id=doi:10.1371{\%}2fjournal.pone.0062774{\&}atitle=copy+num,8,2013,4,"from duplicate 2 (copy number change of the ndm-1 sequence in a multidrug-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolate - huang, t w; chen, t l; chen, y t; lauderdale, t l; liao, t l; lee, y t; chen, c p; liu, y m; lin, a c; chang, y h; wu, k m; kirby, r; lai, j f; tan, m c; siu, l k; chang, c m; fung, c p; tsai, s f)

Through a retrospective study of 26 S. aureus strains isolated from skin lesions of diabetic patients admitted to a hospital in Bangladesh, 2 PVL-gene-positive MRSA-IVa strains and 8 PVL-negative, exfoliative toxin D (ETD) gene (etd)-positive MRSA-IVa strains were isolated. A PVL-positive MRSA-IVa strain had a type I arginine catabolic mobile element (ACME), belonged to ST8/agr-type I/spa-type t121 (a variant of t008), and harbored blaZ, tet(K), msrA, and aph(3')-IIIa, which are mostly typical characteristics found in USA300, a predominant CA-MRSA clone in the United States. Another PVL-positive MRSA strain, belonging to ST1929 (CC88)/agr-type III/spa-type t3341, was negative for ACME, but possessed blaZ and tet(K). The etd-positive MRSA-IVa strains possessed the epidermal cell differentiation inhibitor B (EDIN-B)-encoding gene (edinB) and belonged to ST1931 (CC80)/agr-type III/spa-type t11023 (a variant of t044), which was genetic trait similar to that of the European CA-MRSA ST80 clone. However, unlike the European ST80 strains, the etd-positive MRSA strains detected in the present study harbored seb, sek, and seq, while they were negative for tet(K), aph(3')-IIIa, and fusB, showing susceptibility to fusidic acid. These findings suggested that etd-positive ST1931 MRSA strains belong to the same lineage as the European ST80 MRSA clone, evolving from a common ancestral clone via acquisition of a different pathogenicity island. This is the first report of a USA300-like MRSA-IV strain, PVL-positive ST1929 (CC88) MRSA-IV, and European ST80 CA-MRSA-like etd-positive ST1931 (CC80) MRSA-IV strains isolated in Bangladesh.",S K Paul and S Ghosh and M Kawaguchiya and N Urushibara and M A Hossain and S Ahmed and C Mahmud and M S A Jilani and J A Haq and A A Ahmed and N Kobayashi,"1931-8448

19875,yes,starnino2009,article,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to characterize 22 azithromycin-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates, collected in Italy from January 2007 through June 2008, during a study of the prevalence of antibiotic resistance. METHODS: MICs of azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, penicillin and tetracycline were determined by the Etest method. Azithromycin-resistant strains (MIC {\textgreater} or = 1 mg/L) were genetically analysed by N. gonorrhoeae multi-antigen sequence typing (NG-MAST) and PFGE. RESULTS: A total of 22 azithromycin-resistant isolates were found among the 219 collected. Five of the 22 isolates showed high-level azithromycin resistance (MICs of 128 or 256 mg/L). Sixteen of the 22 were isolated from men who have sex with men. Among the 14 sequence types (STs) found by NG-MAST, 5 STs, containing clusters of two, three or four strains, were homogeneous with respect to epidemiology and/or antibiotic susceptibility. PFGE divided the 22 strains into two main groups that were possibly related. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of gonococci with high-level resistance to azithromycin circulating in Italy. Correlation between NG-MAST results and epidemiological data for some of the analysed strains and patients could be established. This study represents a reference point for future surveillance in Italy and suggests the need to add azithromycin to the antibiotic susceptibility panel for gonococci.",S Starnino and P Stefanelli,0305-7453,J Antimicrob Chemother,"*Drug Resistance, Bacterial,Adult,Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology,Azithromycin/*pharmacology,Bacterial Typing Techniques,Cluster Analysis,DNA Fingerprinting,DNA, Bacterial/genetics,Female,Genotype,Gonorrhea/*microbiology,Humans,Italy,Male,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Middle Aged,Molecular Epidemiology,Neisseria gonorrhoeae/classification/*drug effects,Sequence Analysis, DNA,Young Adult,purification",1200--1204,{Azithromycin-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains recently isolated in Italy},NA,63,2009,6,"1460-2091

Botulism was confirmed by identification of botulinum toxin and Clostridium botulinum in stools. A C. botulinum A2 strain resistant to penicillins and with heterogeneous resistance to metronidazole was isolated from stool samples up to 110 days after onset. Antibiotic susceptibility was tested by disc agar diffusion and MICs were determined by Etest. Whole genome sequencing allowed detection of a gene cluster composed of blaCBP for a novel penicillinase, blaI for a regulator, and blaR1 for a membrane-bound penicillin receptor in the chromosome of the C. botulinum isolate. The purified recombinant penicillinase was assayed. Resistance to beta-lactams was in agreement with the kinetic parameters of the enzyme. In addition, the beta-lactamase gene cluster was found in three C. botulinum genomes in databanks and in two of 62 genomes of our collection, all the strains belonging to group I C. botulinum.

Three strains of K. pneumoniae, isolated in the period 2008-2009 at the University Hospital in Verona, were positive for LAP-2, a narrow-spectrum beta-lactamase. These strains, namely VRB586, VRE185 and VRE196, were cultured from urine, bile and peritoneal drainage, respectively, of different patients from different units. The bla(LAP-2) and qnrS1 resistance determinant genes were separated by ISEcl2 and were located on a 97 kb conjugable and untypable plasmid, which could be transferred to a recipient strain, E. coli J53. The fluoroquinolone and ceftazidime MICs increased 1-2-fold in the transconjugant cells. The three K. pneumoniae strains were found to be clonal by PFGE and were identified as belonging to ST147, an internationally successful clone, by MLST. The plasmid sequence, including ISEcl2 and qnrS1 genes, of K. pneumoniae ST147 was found to be highly similar to previously detected qnrS1-harbouring plasmids, suggesting the plasmid has a stable genetic structure and that these resistance determinants have a common source.

It is extremely important to be aware of the local prevalence of antibiotic resistance so as to adjust treatment strategies. During this single-centre, prospective study, we aimed to determine primary and secondary resistance rates of H. pylori to antibiotics as well as host and bacterial factors associated with this problem. Overall, 180 patients (131 female; mean age 43.4+/-13.5 years; primary resistance 103; secondary resistance 77) with positive (13) C-urea breath test were submitted to upper endoscopy with gastric biopsies. Helicobacter pylori was cultured and antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by Etest and molecular methods. Clinical and microbiological characteristics associated with resistance were evaluated by logistic regression analysis. Among the 180 isolates 50{\%} were resistant to clarithromycin (primary 21.4{\%}; secondary 88.3{\%}), 34.4{\%} to metronidazole (primary 29.1{\%}; secondary 41.6{\%}), 33.9{\%} to levofloxacin (primary 26.2{\%}; secondary 44.2{\%}), 0.6{\%} to tetracycline and 0.6{\%} to amoxicillin. Being female was an independent predictor of resistance to clarithromycin and metronidazole.

Objectives: To investigate the epidemiology of Kp-KPC+ isolates in a secondary general hospital in Greece, with no prior history of Kp-KPC+ until 2010. Methods: Between 2011 and 2014,156 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were recorded from routine laboratory tests. Carbapenemases production was tested by Modified Hodge Test. Phenylboronic acid, EDTA or both along with meropenem discs were used as inhibitors for detection of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases (KPCs), metallo-beta lactamases (MBLs) or both carbapenemases, respectively. Susceptibility testing for various antimicrobial agents including carbapenems was performed by the disk diffusion method according to CLSI criteria. MICs were determined by Vitek- 2 or E-test methodology. BlaKPC, blaVIM and blaNDM genes were detected by PCR. Clinical data, related to admission, previous hospitalizations and outcome, were collected using patients' medical records. Results: During the study period, 18 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were found as KPC-2 producers (11,5{\%}). No other carbapenemase gene was detected in our hospital during the study period. The majority of Kp-KPC (+) isolates were recovered from urine cultures. All isolates were highly resistant to carbapenems, whereas susceptibility rates for colistin, tigecyclin and gentamicin were 100{\%}, 92{\%} and 77{\%}, respectively. The first KPC-2 positive isolate was detected in September 2011. The yearly distribution of these patients was: 2011(3), 2012 (7), 2013 (4), 2014 (4). 10 patients had a history of previous hospitalization in tertiary care hospitals in Athens. Crude mortality rate among patients with Kp-KPC(+) was high (6/18, 33,3{\%}). Colonization/infection during hospitalization was not identified. Conclusion: In our hospital there is a low prevalence of Kp-KPC+ compared to tertiary care hospitals in Athens. Given the antimicrobial therapy toxicity, the prolongation of hospitalization and the mortality due to possible therapy failure, special care should be taken.",A Tatsiopoulos and K Tryfinopoulou and A Stamatiou and P Giakouppi and E Petinaki,2047-2994,Antimicrobial Resistance and Infection Control,"Greece,Klebsiella pneumoniae,antiinfective agent,antimicrobial therapy,benzeneboronic acid,beta lactamase,carbapenem derivative,carbapenemase,clinical study,colistin,disk diffusion,edetic acid,epidemiology,epsilometer test,gene,general hospital,gentamicin,hospital,hospitalization,human,infection control,laboratory test,medical record,meropenem,methodology,mortality,patient,prevalence,prevention,public health problem,tertiary care center,toxicity,treatment failure,urine culture",NA,{Epidemiological study of Klebsiella pneumonia isolates producing KPC-2 carbapenemase in a general hospital over a four year period in Greece},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l72039071 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=20472994{\&}id=doi:{\&}atitle=epidemiological+study+of+klebsiella+pneumonia+isolates+producing+kpc-2+carbapenemase+i,4,2015,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,maybe,jake,no,ayomide,allison,mushtaq,yes,md_4.csv,NA,NA,md_4_2.mex,yes,journal

The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of these resistance phenotypes among clinical isolates of Escherichia coli (EC), Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) and Klebsiella oxytoca (KO) collected from USA subjects during the 2010 Assessing Worldwide Antimicrobial Resistance Evaluation (AWARE) Surveillance program. Methods: Clinical isolates (1 per patient) of EC (n = 657), KP (n = 653) and KO (n = 250) were collected from 65 medical centres geographically distributed across the USA. Specimen infection sources included; blood (53.6{\%}), skin (SSSI; 10.0{\%}{\%}), respiratory (RTI; 11.4{\%}) and urine (UTI; 22.3{\%}). All isolates were centrally tested for susceptibility to various antimicrobials by CLSI broth microdilution methods (M100-S21). ESBL phenotypes included isolates with MICs âÃ¢â¢ 2 mg/L for ceftriaxone, ceftazidime or aztreonam. Carbapenem-resistant isolates included those with MICs âÃ¢â¢ 2 mg/L for meropenem. Resistant phenotypes were evaluated among different specimen sources and by geography using the nine USA census regions. Results: ESBL phenotypes were present for {\textgreater}12{\%} of all collected EC, KP and KO from all specimen sources. ESBL phenotypes ranged from 10.6{\%} for KP to 16.6{\%} for EC from SSSI, from 10.4{\%} for KP to 31.4{\%} for EC among RTI isolates, and from 4.7{\%} for KO to 7.3{\%} for EC for UTI isolates. ESBL phenotypes of EC and Klebsiella spp. were most prevalent in the East South Central region of the USA at 22{\%} and 23{\%}, respectively and least prevalent in the Pacific region (8.3{\%} and 6.7{\%}, respectively). ESBL phenotypes were greater than two-fold higher among nosocomial organisms (18.5{\%}) when compared with community-acquired organisms (8.1{\%}). ESBL phenotypes were often resistant to fluoroquinolones (âÃ¢â¢70{\%}). Carbapenem resistance was detected among 27 (4.1{\%}) isolates of KP with the highest prevalence rates being observed in the Mid-Atlantic (13.8{\%}) and West South Central regions (8.0{\%}). Conclusions: ESBL and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae are prevalent among USA clinical isolates and will continue to pose a threat to the existing armamentarium of beta-lactam antibiotics.

We analyzed healthcare- and community-associated infections among community-onset infections. In total, 3612 Enterobacteriaceae isolates were collected; the prevalence of ESBL-PE infection increased over the study period, from 2.4{\%} to 5.1{\%} (P {\textless} 0.001). Among the 90 children with a first community-onset ESBL-PE infection, 58{\%} (n = 52) had a healthcare-associated infection, and 87{\%} of isolates were susceptible to amikacin.

12079,maybe,liakopoulos2011,article,"Objective: To investigate the mechanism of high-level methicillinresistance in a Staphylococcus lugdunensis isolate. Materials and Methods: The microorganism was isolated from blood culture of a patient with endocarditis. Identification to the species level was performed by the Vitek 2 System and was verified by a molecular method based on fbl gene. Susceptibility testing to various antimicrobial agents was assessed by the Vitek 2 system, while the MICs values were determined by Etest. The production of penicillinase was performed by the nitrocephin disk test, while the presence of mecA gene was detected by PCR. In order to detect mutations in PBP1 and PBP4 genes, amplification followed by sequencing analysis was done and the results were compared with those obtained from a clinical S. lugdunensis strain susceptible to oxacillin (MIC: 0.75 mg/L). Results: The isolate, despite the high-level resistance to oxacillin (MIC: 256 mg/L), did not carry the mecA gene, while no overproduction of penicillinase or mutation of PBP4 were detected. However some mutations were found in PBP1: an alteration in the 482 position (L482P) and an insertion in 570 position of four aminoacids (SAYG).

22005,maybe,wada2016,article,"Objectives: We analyzed bacterial strains isolated from urine samples of patients with urinary tract infections (UTI) at Okayama University Hospital over a 30-year period to characterize trends in species and antimicrobial susceptibilities. Methods: Clinical isolates were collected from in- and out-patients with pyuria and bacteriuria who were treated between 1984 and 2014 (one episode per patient and plural isolates were counted in polymicrobial infection). We examined these isolates to identify pathogens and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility. Results: Isolates from complicated UTI over a 30-year period revealed Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) was the most frequently isolated in the first decade (1984-1994), MRSA in the second decade (1995-2004), and Escherichia coli (E. coli) in the latest decade (2005-2014). In uncomplicated UTI examined over 20 years, E. coli was the most frequently isolated species accounting for 47-94{\%} of isolates. Fluoroquinolone (FQs)-insusceptible E. coli were first isolated in 1994 and increased to about 35{\%} in 2013 in patients with complicated UTI. Conclusions: Complicated UTI involving P. aeruginosa and MRSA decreased over the last 10 years. Our data suggest that several factors such as shorter hospitalizations, shorter indwelling catheter use, and appropriate antimicrobial use has decreased colonization of P. aeruginosa and MRSA with relative increases in isolation of E. coli including FQs-insusceptible strains.We must continue our surveillance of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria isolated from urine samples and evaluate antibiograms, since their persistence in the urinary tract would be problematic.",K Wada and S Uehara and M Yamamoto and T Sadahira and R Mitsuhata and M Araki and Y Kobayashi and A Ishii and R Kariyama and T Watanabe and Y Nasu and H Kumon,"1437-7780

METHODS: P. mirabilis 18306 was isolated in March 2006 from a patient in Palestine with diabetic foot infection. Antibiotic susceptibility tests and various molecular techniques, including PCR, cloning and DNA sequencing were used for detection and characterization of SGI1 in P. mirabilis 18306. RESULTS: P. mirabilis 18306 showed the typical multidrug resistance phenotype of SGI1 as it was resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulphonamides and tetracycline, in addition to trimethoprim and nalidixic acid. Molecular characterization showed that P. mirabilis 18306 harboured a structure similar to SGI1, except that the aadA2 gene, which confers resistance to streptomycin and spectinomycin, of standard SGI1 had been replaced with dfrA15, which confers resistance to trimethoprim. Furthermore, the nucleotide sequence of the extrachromosomal circular form of SGI1 in P. mirabilis was found to be identical to that of Salmonella Typhimurium DT104. However, PCR results showed that P. mirabilis 18306 was negative for the left and right junctions which represent the integration sites of SGI1 into Salmonella enterica chromosome. Hence, this new variant of SGI1 may be integrated at a different site into the chromosome of P. mirabilis 18306. Tn1826-derived class 2 integron, which carries only two gene cassettes, sat2 and aadA1, was also identified in this strain. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we identified a new variant SGI1 containing the multiple resistance genomic region in a multidrug-resistant strain of P. mirabilis.

We describe a biphasic VRE outbreak and identify risk factors for VRE acquisition. METHODS: After the occurrence of 2 cases of VRE infections in a 44-bed NICU, a bundle of interventions was implemented that included active surveillance cultures for VRE, enhanced infection control measures, and audits on antimicrobial use, from June to December 2008. Analysis was performed using polymerase chain reaction and pulse-field gel electrophoresis techniques. A case-control study was conducted to identify risk factors. RESULTS: Among 253 neonates screened, 101 (39.9{\%}) were found to be colonized with VRE. During the first 9 weeks of the study period, 59 new cases were detected. Molecular analysis showed 1 predominant clone. During weeks 10-12, no new cases of VRE colonization were detected; however, at week 13, just when the outbreak appeared to be over, a second wave occurred, with 42 new cases and multiple clones detected. Multivariate analysis identified administration of antimicrobial therapy for late-onset neonatal sepsis and hospitalization during the first month of this outbreak as significant risk factors for VRE colonization. CONCLUSION: Both a high prevalence of VRE colonization and antimicrobial use promoted the transmission of VRE during this biphasic outbreak. Adherence to infection control measures and antimicrobial stewardship policies are of utmost importance.",E Iosifidis and I Evdoridou and E Agakidou and E Chochliourou and E Protonotariou and K Karakoula and I Stathis and D Sofianou and V Drossou-Agakidou and S Pournaras and E Roilides,"0196-6553

Recently, Malaysia has been alarmed by the occurrence of Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates carrying NDM-1 and KPC genes, which also known as high-consequence antibiotic resistance threats. Here, we described the in-vitro activity of broad-spectrum antibiotics and the mechanism of resistant used by Carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae strains of different genotype. Methods: The strains used in the study were previously isolated from patients admitted to Universiti Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC). The strains were genotyped using PFGE and Carbapenemase production was confirmed via modified Hodge Test. Susceptibility of the strains to Aminoglycosides, Carbapenems, Cephalosporins, Penicilin, Quinolone, Tetracycline, and Polypeptides were determined using Kirby Bauer method and the Minimum inhibitory concentrations of each antibiotic were confirmed using E-test. The presences of carbapenemase hydrolyzing genes as well as the genes encoding ESBL were determined. Results: A total of 17 Carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae were subtyped into 9 pulsotypes. The prevalence of OXA48 among the strains was high (71{\%}). The OXA48 eproducing strains were subtyped into 5 different pulsotypes where 8 strains shared similar pulsotype. There were 8 KPC-, 2 IMPand 1 NDM- positive strains detected. However, the presence of these carbapenemase hydrolyzing genes was weakly correlated to the genotypes of the strains. All the strains showed high resistance to the antibiotics tested except for Tigecycline and Colistin.

Outbreaks of LNZ-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (LRCNS) have been reported in ICU patients worldwide. Although LNZ resistance among CNS is extremely rare, it seems to be an emerging problem. OBJECTIVES. To analyze the epidemiologic and clinical features of an outbreak of LRCNS in a 22-bed ICU. METHODS. Observational study of ICU patients with infection or colonization by LRCNS in a 600-bed teaching hospital (2010-2012). Demographic data, comorbidities, APACHE II antibiotic exposure, invasive procedures, site of infection or colonization, ICU LOS, and mortality were recorded. Susceptibility study was performed by broth microdilution and E-test. The presence of cfr gen was studied by PCR. LNZ ICU utilization data (2009-2012) was obtained from the Hospital Pharmacy. Defined daily dose (DDD) of LNZ was 1,200 mg. RESULTS. We detected 42 isolates in 42 patients. The isolates were identified as S. epidermidis (36 cases) and S. hominis (6), and were recovered from blood (33 cases) urine (6), catheter (2) and peritoneal fluid (1); most of them were not associated with clinical infection. All isolates were resistant to LNZ (MIC[4 mg/L) but were found to be susceptible to vancomycin, teicoplanin, and daptomycin. Molecular study showed cfrmediated LNZ resistance in 45 {\%} of the tested isolates. Most patients were male (81 {\%}), the mean age was 61 years. The main diagnosis at ICU admission was respiratory failure (43 {\%}), stroke (17 {\%}), trauma (12 {\%}) and shock (12 {\%}), 33 {\%} of them were immunodepressed. Mean APACHE II score 22.5 and mean ICU LOS 43 days. 41 had central venous and urinary catheter, and most of them received mechanical ventilation (38), parenteral nutrition (12) or renal replacement therapy (8); 20 patients required surgery or other invasive procedures. The mean ICU LOS before LRSCN isolation was 34 days, and a high proportion of patients had received antimicrobials in the previous month: Lnz in 37 (mean duration 11.8 days), carbapenems in 21, and other beta-lactam in 16. LRCNS was associated with clinical infection in only 5 patients (12 {\%}): catheter-related bacteremia (2), urinary infection (2), and primary bacteremia (1) treated successfully with alternative antimicrobials. Overall ICU mortality was 29 {\%}. Mean LNZ DDD/100 patient-days was 13.4 with no statistical difference from 2009 to 2012. CONCLUSIONS. LRSCN have emerged in Spain in critically ill patients with common risk factors for nosocomial infection such as invasive procedures and antibiotic exposure. Most isolates represent colonization, being less frequent the appearance of clinical infection. All isolates remained susceptible to alternative antimicrobials such as glycopeptides and daptomycin.

To characterize all the Staphylococcus aureus isolates by phage typing; and the MRSA isolates by biotyping and typing by antibiogram, in addition. Materials and methods: A total of 56 cases of DNSIs from a 1600- bedded tertiary care teaching hospital of New delhi were recruited. Aspirated pus from the patients were cultured and the Staphylococcus aureus isolates were identified by conventional techniques. The antimicrobial susceptibility against a wide range of antimicrobial agents was performed by the disc diffusion method employing the modified Stokes' technique. The MICs of vancomycin, teicoplanin, amikacin, ciprofloxacin, mupirocin, fusidic acid were determined by the E test. Screening for methicillin resistance was performed both by cefoxitin disc method as well as oxacillin agar screening method. All the isolates were subjected to bacteriophage typing by the 23 conventional (basic) set of phages (Blair et al). All the MRSA isolates were further subjected to biotyping (Coia et al.) and a novel typing method using the antibiogram. Observations: Staphylococcus aureus was isolated in 46.4{\%} of cases (n = 56). Of the 26 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus obtained, 3(11.5{\%}) were identified as MRSA. Penicillin resistance was found to be 100{\%} among S. aureus isolates. Cotrimoxazole resistance was seen in 100{\%} of MRSA and 69.6{\%} of methicillin Sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) isolates, while ciprofloxacin resistance in 66.6{\%} and 56.8{\%} respectively. However, all the S. aureus isolates were uniformly sensitive to vancomycin and teicoplanin at MIC90 value of 2 $\mu$g/mL for both. An overall phage typeablilty of 53.9{\%} was observed for the isolates with maximum in the mixed group of phages (39.1{\%}). Biotyping of MRSA isolates showed that all the three MRSA isolates belonged to biotype A. Based on the antibiogram pattern, the three different isolates of MRSA showed three distinct resistant phenotypes.

Severe MRSA infections have been associated with the virulence factor Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL). The aim of this study was to investigate susceptibility patterns, the presence of toxin genes, including that encoding PVL, and clonality among MRSA isolates collected from patients in Greece over a 12-year period. MRSA isolates were collected from January 2001 to December 2012 from six different hospitals. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined with the disk diffusion method and the Etest. The presence of the toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 gene (tst), the enterotoxin gene cluster (egc) and the PVL gene was tested with PCR. The genotypic characteristics of the strains were analysed by SCCmec and agr typing, and clonality was determined with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing. An increasing rate of MRSA among S. aureus infections was detected up to 2008. The majority of PVL-positive MRSA isolates belonged to a single clone, sequence type (ST)80-IV, which was disseminated both in the community and in hospitals, especially during the warmest months of the year. Carriage of tst was associated with ST30-IV, whereas egc was distributed in different clones. CA-MRSA isolates were recovered mainly from skin and soft tissue infections, whereas HA-MRSA isolates were associated with surgical and wound infections. During the period 2001-2012, ST80-IV predominated in the community and infiltrated the hospital settings in Greece, successfully replacing other PVL-positive clones. The predominance of ST239-III in HA-MRSA infections was constant, whereas new clones have also emerged.

Despite the high burden of multidrug resistant tuberculosis in the country, little is known about drug resistance patterns, prevalence, and predictors of fluoroquinolones resistance among multidrug resistant tuberculosis patients from Pakistan. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate drug resistance patterns, prevalence, and predictors of fluoroquinolones resistance in multidrug resistant tuberculosis patients. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted at a programmatic management unit of drug resistant tuberculosis, Lady Reading Hospital Peshawar, Pakistan. Two hundred and forty-three newly diagnosed multidrug resistant tuberculosis patients consecutively enrolled for treatment at study site from January 1, 2012 to July 28, 2013 were included in the study. A standardized data collection form was used to collect patients' socio-demographic, microbiological, and clinical data. SPSS 16 was used for data analysis. RESULTS: High degree of drug resistance (median 5 drugs, range 2-8) was observed. High proportion of patients was resistant to all five first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs (62.6{\%}), and more than half were resistant to second line drugs (55.1{\%}). The majority of the patients were ofloxacin resistant (52.7{\%}). Upon multivariate analysis previous tuberculosis treatment at private (OR=1.953, p=0.034) and public private mix (OR=2.824, p=0.046) sectors were predictors of ofloxacin resistance. CONCLUSION: The high degree of drug resistance observed, particularly to fluoroquinolones, is alarming.

This study analysed a total of 366 ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae strains isolated from non-selected patient specimens at the university hospital of Tubingen in the period January 2003 to December 2007. Although the overall ESBL rate was comparatively low (1.6 {\%}), the percentages of ESBL-producing Enterobacter spp. and Escherichia coli increased from 0.8 and 0.5 {\%}, respectively, in 2003 to 4.6 and 3.8 {\%} in 2007. In particular, the emergence was observed of one carbapenem-resistant ESBL-producing E. coli isolate and five carbapenem-non-susceptible ESBL-positive Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, in two of which carbapenem resistance development was documented in vivo under a meropenem-containing antibiotic regime. The possible underlying mechanism for this carbapenem resistance in three of the K. pneumoniae isolates was loss of the Klebsiella porin channel protein OmpK36 as shown by PCR analysis. The remaining two K. pneumoniae isolates exhibited increased expression of a tripartite AcrAB-TolC efflux pump as demonstrated by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry analysis of bacterial outer-membrane extracts, which, in addition to other unknown mechanisms, may contribute towards increasing the carbapenem MIC values further. Carbapenem-non-susceptible ESBL isolates may pose a new problem in the future due to possible outbreak situations and limited antibiotic treatment options. Therefore, a systematic exploration of intestinal colonization with ESBL isolates should be reconsidered, at least for haemato-oncological departments from where four of the five carbapenem-non-susceptible ESBL isolates originated.",S Grobner and D Linke and W Schutz and C Fladerer and J Madlung and I B Autenrieth and W Witte and Y Pfeifer,"0022-2615 (print)

We analysed all 692 isolates of Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhi from cases in England, Scotland and Wales that were sent to the Laboratory of Enteric Pathogens at the Health Protection Agency, Centre for Infections, London, UK between 2000 and 2003. The country of acquisition was known for 416 isolates (60{\%}), and the majority of these (70{\%}) came from India or Pakistan. Overall, 24 countries were listed, mainly in Asia and Africa. A total of 48 phage types were detected, 41{\%} of which were Vi-phage type E1. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed that 22{\%} of isolates were multidrug resistant (MDR) (defined as resistance to chloramphenicol, ampicillin and co-trimoxazole) and 39{\%} were quinolone resistant. A significant number of isolates (n=49) were sensitive to nalidixic acid by disk test but exhibited low-level ciprofloxacin resistance, suggesting a novel mechanism of resistance and reinforcing the need for minimum inhibitory concentration determination. Overall, 13{\%} of isolates were both MDR and likely to show a poor response to a fluoroquinolone. A third-generation cephalosporin (e.g. ceftriaxone) should be considered as empirical therapy in regions of the Indian subcontinent where resistance is now at high levels as well as in patients returning from these areas.

In the present study, 198 E. coli isolates from patients with UTIs in Shanghai in 2008 were examined by susceptibility testing, with an extremely high number (153/198) showing multidrug resistance (MDR). And, the expression of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) reached 48.5{\%} (96/198). The resistance rates to penicillins, fluoroquinolone, folate pathway inhibitors and first- and second-generation cephalosporins were high. Molecular analyses showed that the CTX-M-9 group (70/96) was the most common CTX-M group among UPEC, followed by the CTX-M-1 group (27/96). Phylogenetic group D accounted for 42.4{\%} (84/198) of the isolates, exhibiting the highest ESBLs (50/84) and MDR (75/84) rates. Virulence genes were present in a significantly high proportion in the phylogenetic group B2 isolates, except for the afaBC gene. The ESBL-producing strains analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) were clustered into six groups at a cutoff of 67{\%}. Notably, the findings that afaBC was specific to phylogenetic group D and PFGE group I and was correlated with the CTX-M-9 group were different from a previous report.

8810,maybe,holt2011a,article,"BACKGROUND: typhoid fever remains a public health problem in Vietnam, with a significant burden in the Mekong River delta region. Typhoid fever is caused by the bacterial pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi), which is frequently multidrug resistant with reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolone-based drugs, the first choice for the treatment of typhoid fever. We used a GoldenGate (Illumina) assay to type 1,500 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and analyse the genetic variation of S. Typhi isolated from 267 typhoid fever patients in the Mekong delta region participating in a randomized trial conducted between 2004 and 2005. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: the population of S. Typhi circulating during the study was highly clonal, with 91{\%} of isolates belonging to a single clonal complex of the S. Typhi H58 haplogroup. The patterns of disease were consistent with the presence of an endemic haplotype H58-C and a localised outbreak of S. Typhi haplotype H58-E2 in 2004. H58-E2-associated typhoid fever cases exhibited evidence of significant geo-spatial clustering along the Song H u branch of the Mekong River. Multidrug resistance was common in the established clone H58-C but not in the outbreak clone H58-E2, however all H58 S. Typhi were nalidixic acid resistant and carried a Ser83Phe amino acid substitution in the gyrA gene. SIGNIFICANCE: the H58 haplogroup dominates S. Typhi populations in other endemic areas, but the population described here was more homogeneous than previously examined populations, and the dominant clonal complex (H58-C, -E1, -E2) observed in this study has not been detected outside Vietnam. IncHI1 plasmid-bearing S. Typhi H58-C was endemic during the study period whilst H58-E2, which rarely carried the plasmid, was only transient, suggesting a selective advantage for the plasmid. These data add insight into the outbreak dynamics and local molecular epidemiology of S.

18956,yes,shahraki-zahedani2016,article,"INTRODUCTION: Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) are bacterial enzymes capable of hydrolyzing beta-lactams. The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence of TEM- and SHV-type ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae strains in Zahedan, Southeast Iran. METHODS: A total of 170 non-repetitive K. pneumoniae strains were collected from patients referred to three teaching hospitals of Zahedan. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was determined for 17 antibiotics using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. The frequency of ESBL-producing strains was calculated, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of ESBL-producing strains were determined for cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and cefpodoxime. The presence of bla TEM and bla SHV genes was tested in all ESBL-producing strains using polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Among the 170 K. pneumoniae clinical isolates, 55 (32.4{\%}) were ESBL producers; 92.7{\%} (n=51) and 72.7{\%} (n=40) of the isolates carried the bla SHV and bla TEM genes, respectively, and 67.3{\%} (n=37) carried both genes. The sequencing results showed that all bla TEM types were bla TEM-1, except for two isolates that were bla TEM-104. The bla SHV types were bla SHV-1, bla SHV-11, bla SHV-12, bla SHV-99, bla SHV-108, and bla SHV-110. CONCLUSIONS: The percentage of bla TEM and bla SHV among ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae isolates from Zahedan is relatively high, indicating the need for further surveillance and consideration in antibiotic use. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of TEM-104-, SHV-99-, SHV-108-, and SHV-110-type ESBLs among clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae from Iran, and TEM-1, SHV-1, SHV-11, and SHV-12 appear to be the dominant ESBLs in this region.",S Shahraki-Zahedani and S Rigi and M Bokaeian and A Ansari-Moghaddam and M Moghadampour,0037-8682,Rev Soc Bras Med Trop,"Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology,Bacterial Proteins/*genetics,DNA, Bacterial/*genetics,Disk Diffusion Antimicrobial Tests,Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial/genetics,Genes, Bacterial,Genotype,Humans,Iran,Klebsiella Infections/microbiology,Klebsiella pneumoniae/*drug effects/*genetics,Phenotype,Sequence Analysis, DNA,beta-Lactamases/*biosynthesis",441--445,"{First report of TEM-104-, SHV-99-, SHV-108-, and SHV-110-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae from Iran}",NA,49,2016,4,"1678-9849

18587,maybe,schimithbier2010,article,"BACKGROUND: In the last few years, carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii isolates (CR-AB) have been identified worldwide. The first description of OXA-23-producing A baumannii in Brazil was from the city of Curitiba in 2003. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the persistence and dissemination of the first OXA-23-producing A baumannii clone isolated from patients in Hospital de Clinicas, Curitiba, Brazil. METHODS: An antimicrobial susceptibility profile of the isolates was determined by the standard agar dilution method. Molecular detection of beta-lactamase genes was done by polymerase chain reaction. The clonal relationship of the isolates was analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Epidemiologic and clinical features were evaluated as well. RESULTS: Genotypic analysis of 172 CR-AB isolates by PFGE identified 3 distinct major PFGE clusters (A, B, and C, accounting for 36, 69, and 65 isolates, respectively). All isolates carried the bla(OXA-23)-like gene and were multidrug-resistant, but were susceptible to tigecycline and polymixin B. The mortality rate related to CR-AB infection was 45.4{\%}, and ventilator-associated pneumonia and bloodstream infections were the most frequent clinical manifestations. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of 3 clones among the CR-AB isolates suggests that cross-transmission was the main mechanism responsible for dissemination of OXA-23 producers. PFGE pattern A was genotypically similar to that of the first OXA-23-producing A baumannii clone identified in Curitiba in 1999. This clone persisted in the same hospital until April 2004. The presence of the bla(OXA-)23-like gene was the main mechanism associated with carbapenem resistance among the isolates studied.",K E {Schimith Bier} and S O Luiz and M C Scheffer and A C Gales and M C Paganini and A J Nascimento and E Carignano and L M {Dalla Costa},0196-6553,Am J Infect Control,"*Bacterial Typing Techniques,*beta-Lactam Resistance,Acinetobacter Infections/*epidemiology/microbiolog,Acinetobacter baumannii/classification/*drug effec,Adolescent,Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology,Bacterial Proteins/genetics,Brazil/epidemiology,Carbapenems/*pharmacology,Child,Child, Preschool,DNA Fingerprinting,DNA, Bacterial/genetics,Female,Gene Transfer, Horizontal,Humans,Infant,Male,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Middle Aged,Molecular Epidemiology,Polymerase Chain Reaction,Young Adult,beta-Lactamases/genetics,purification",308--314,"{Temporal evolution of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii in Curitiba, southern Brazil}",NA,38,2010,4,"1527-3296

2595,yes,brennan2014,article,"Background. Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) are clinically challenging, threaten patient safety, and represent an emerging public health issue. CRE reporting is not mandated in Michigan. Methods. The Michigan Department of Community Health-led CRE Surveillance and Prevention Initiative enrolled 21 facilities (17 acute care and 4 long-term acute care facilities) across the state. Baseline data collection began September 1, 2012, and ended February 28, 2013 (duration, 6 months). Enrolled facilities voluntarily reported cases of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli according to the surveillance algorithm. Patient demographic characteristics, laboratory testing, microbiology, clinical, and antimicrobial information were captured via standardized data collection forms. Facilities reported admissions and patient-days each month. Results. One-hundred two cases over 957,220 patient-days were reported, resulting in a crude incidence rate of 1.07 cases per 10,000 patient-days. Eighty-nine case patients had test results positive for K. pneumoniae, whereas 13 had results positive for E. coli. CRE case patients had a mean age of 63 years, and 51{\%} were male. Urine cultures (61{\%}) were the most frequently reported specimen source. Thirtyfive percent of cases were hospital onset; sixty-five percent were community onset (CO), although 75{\%} of CO case patients reported healthcare exposure within the previous 90 days. Cardiovascular disease, renal failure, and diabetes mellitus were the most frequently reported comorbid conditions. Common ris k factors included surgery within the previous 90 days, recent infection or colonization with a multidrug-resistant organism, and recent exposures to antimicrobials, especially third- or fourth-generation cephalosporins. Conclusions. CRE are found throughout Michigan healthcare facilities. Implementing a regional, coordinated surveillance and prevention initiative may prevent CRE from becoming hyperendemic in Michigan. {\textcopyright} 2014 by The Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America.

17411,yes,redondo2013,article,"CTX-M-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae have been previously reported in Venezuela. We assessed the frequency and diversity of CTX-M enzymes among 97 ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates as well as to establish the genetic relationship among CTX-M producers collected from six hospitals in Caracas. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays identified the blaCTX-M genes in 42 isolates (43.3{\%}). The blaCTX-M-1 group was the most common in Escherichia coli (91 {\%}) and the blaCTX-M-2 in Klebsiella pneumoniae (56.6{\%}). Presence of blaCTX-M-1, blaCTX-M-2, blaCTX-M-15, and blaCTX-M-14 was revealed by sequencing analysis. The CTX-M producers were mainly isolated from urine samples (46{\%}). Antimicrobial susceptibility tests showed that a high proportion of CTX-M-producing isolates was resistant to ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Analysis of enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus PCR and repetitive extragenic palindromic PCR profiles revealed several genetic clusters between isolates carrying the blaCTX-M-1 group, while complete genotypic diversity among isolates carrying the blaCTX-M-2 group was observed. This study documented that CTX-M has achieved a citywide distribution, with the CTX-M-1 group as the most frequent (66.7{\%}). The CTX-M clusters detected suggest that patient-patient transmission may have played an important role in the widespread and high prevalence of the CTX-M-1 group.

9811,maybe,jolivet2016,article,"Background Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus raffinosus has rarely been associated with nosocomial infection and outbreaks. Aim To report the successful control of a nosocomial outbreak of vanA-type vancomycin-resistant E.Â¬â raffinosus in a surgical intensive care unit. Methods The investigation of the outbreak is reported with control measures taken. Molecular typing of vancomycin-resistant E.Â¬â raffinosus isolates was performed by repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Findings Between September and October 2014, vancomycin-resistant E.Â¬â raffinosus isolates were isolated from four patients. The index patient had been hospitalized previously in Portugal, and was not found to be colonized by vancomycin-resistant enterococci on screening cultures obtained at admission. However, vancomycin-resistant E.Â¬â raffinosus was isolated from a bile sample 19 days after hospital admission. All four isolates were resistant to both vancomycin and teicoplanin due to the presence of the vanA gene, while remaining susceptible to daptomycin and linezolid. Repetitive sequence-based PCR confirmed the spread of a single vanA-positive E.Â¬â raffinosus clone. Infection control measures including direct PCR screening on rectal specimens, contact precautions, and cohorting of patients and personnel led to successful control of the outbreak. Conclusion This is the first reported outbreak of vanA-type vancomycin-resistant E.Â¬â raffinosus in France in both clinical and screening specimens among hospitalized patients. The inability of routine selective screening media to detect the vancomycin-resistant E.Â¬â raffinosus in the index case likely contributed to the outbreak.",S Jolivet and M Fines-Guyon and B Nebbad and J C Merle and D {Le Pluart} and C Brun-Buisson and J W Decousser and V Cattoir,"1532-2939

12503,maybe,lopes2013a,article,"INTRODUCTION: Acinetobacter baumannii is opportunistic in debilitated hospitalised patients. Because information from some South American countries was previously lacking, this study examined the emergence of multi-resistant A. baumannii in three hospitals in Cochabamba, Bolivia, from 2008 to 2009. METHODOLOGY: Multiplex PCR was used to identify the main resistance genes in 15 multi-resistant A. baumannii isolates. RT-PCR was used to measure gene expression. The genetic environment of these genes was also analysed by PCR amplification and sequencing. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined for key antibiotics and some were determined in the presence of an efflux pump inhibitor, 1-(1-napthylmethyl) piperazine. RESULTS: Fourteen strains were found to be multi-resistant. Each strain was found to have the blaOXA-58 gene with the ISAba3-like element upstream, responsible for over-expression of the latter and subsequent carbapenem resistance. Similarly, ISAba1, upstream of the blaADC gene caused over-expression of the latter and cephalosporin resistance; mutations in the gyrA(Ser83 to Leu) and parC (Ser-80 to Phe) genes were commensurate with fluoroquinolone resistance. In addition, the adeA, adeB efflux genes were over-expressed. All 15 isolates were positive for at least two aminoglycoside resistance genes. CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the first reports analyzing the multi-drug resistance profile of A. baumannii strains isolated in Bolivia and shows that the over-expression of theblaOXA-58, blaADC and efflux genes together with aminoglycoside modifying enzymes and mutations in DNA topoisomerases are responsible for the multi-resistance of the bacteria and the subsequent difficulty in treating infections caused by them.",B S Lopes and L Gallego and S G Amyes,1972-2680,J Infect Dev Ctries,"*Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial,*Genes, Bacterial,Acinetobacter Infections/microbiology,Acinetobacter baumannii/drug effects/enzymology/*g,Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology,Bacterial Outer Membrane Proteins/genetics,Bacterial Proteins/genetics,Bolivia,DNA Gyrase/genetics,Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial,Humans,Membrane Transport Proteins/genetics,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Mutation,Piperazines/pharmacology,Porins/genetics,beta-Lactamases/genetics,purification",323--328,{Multi-drug resistance profiles and the genetic features of Acinetobacter baumannii isolates from Bolivia},NA,7,2013,4,"1972-2680

13995,yes,mina2011a,article,"Objective: We report on a case of a toe wound infection caused by a multi-drug resistant (MDR) Corynebacterium diphtheriae. Method: Retrospective case review was performed. The bacterium was recovered and identified using standard methods at the local and provincial laboratories, then forwarded to the National Microbiology Laboratory for toxin analysis. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing and typing (by multilocus sequence typing [MLST]) were done; ermX was detected by PCR. Results: The patient was a non-immunized 38y old male with a recent travel history to India, who presented with a skin abscess. The isolate was identified as C diphtheriae biotype mitis and toxigenic. MLST type was ST 136, a type unique to the NML database and published literature. The isolate was resistant to clindamycin and erythromycin (ermX gene positive) as well as to tetracycline and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole with intermediate values towards ceftriaxone and cefotaxime. Although no interpretation guidelines exists for telithromycin and chloramphenicol, the Isolatedemonstrated high MICs (micrograms/ml) of {\textgreater}4 and 32 respectively.

Microbiological and epidemiological data from 2009 to 2011were extracted from the laboratory information system and electronic medical records. One hundred and eleven unique patient episodes consisting of 116 anaerobic isolates were selected for clinical review and antibiotic susceptibility testing. Susceptibilities to amoxicillin-clavulanate, clindamycin, imipenem, metronidazole, moxifloxacin, penicillin and piperacillin-tazobactam were performed using Etest strips with categorical interpretations according to current CLSI breakpoints. Metronidazole-resistant and carbapenem-resistant anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli were screened for the nim and cfiA genes. Clinical data was obtained retrospectively from electronic medical records. During the 3 year period, Bacteroides fragilis group (41{\%}), Clostridium species (14{\%}), Propionibacterium species (9{\%}) and Fusobacterium species (6{\%}) were the most commonly isolated anaerobes. Patients with anaerobic bacteraemia that were included in the study were predominantly above 60 years of age, with community-acquired infections. The most commonly used empiric antibiotic therapies were beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations (44{\%}) and metronidazole (10{\%}). The crude mortality was 25{\%}, and appropriate initial antibiotic therapy was not significantly associated with improved survival. Intra-abdominal infections (39{\%}) and soft-tissue infections (33{\%}) accounted for nearly three-quarters of all bacteraemia. Antibiotics with the best anaerobic activity were imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, amoxicillin-clavulanate and metronidazole, with in-vitro susceptibility rates of 95{\%}, 95{\%}, 94{\%} and 92{\%} respectively. Susceptibilities to penicillin (31{\%}), clindamycin (60{\%}) and moxifloxacin (84{\%}) were more variable. Two multidrug-resistant isolates of Bacteroides species were positive for nim and cfiA genes respectively, while another two imipenem-resistant Fusobacterium species were negative for cfiA genes. This study demonstrated that anaerobic bacteraemia in our patient population was predominantly associated with intra-abdominal and soft-tissue infections. Overall antibiotic resistance was high for penicillin and clindamycin, and the presence of emerging resistance to carbapenems and metronidazole warrants further monitoring.",T Y Tan and L S Y Ng and L L Kwang and S Rao and L C Eng,"1095-8274

2020,maybe,beutlich2013,article,"Drug-resistant derivatives of serovar-specific virulence plasmids, such as pSLT, in clinically-relevant Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strains, represent a threat for human health. We have analysed 14 S. Typhimurium isolates recovered in Italy and the United Kingdom from swine and from cases of human infection for the presence of virulence-resistance (VR) plasmids. They were negative for the multidrug resistance (MDR) region of the Salmonella genomic island 1 (SGI1), but expressed resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin/spectinomycin, sulfamethoxazole, and tetracyclines. The isolates were characterised by XbaI pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, multilocus sequence typing, and detection of resistance and virulence determinants (PCR/sequencing). Identification of VR plasmids was accomplished by PCR detection of bla genes (encoding ampicillin resistance), class 1 integrons and the pSLT virulence gene spvC. Plasmid analyses were performed by alkaline lysis, S1-nuclease digestion, replicon typing, conjugation, restriction analyses, and Southern blot/hybridization. Two blaOXA-1 positive isolates contained pSLT-derived plasmids related to pUO-StVR2. In nine isolates, eight from swine and one from a patient, MDR-conferring-IncFII-VR plasmids were detected. They contained the blaTEM-1 gene as well as a nonconventional class 1 integron with dfrA12-aadA2 gene cassettes in its variable region, and a sul3 gene in the 3' conserved segment. Restriction analysis suggested a novel pSLT variant. The results obtained underline the role of swine as a potential reservoir for the blaTEM-1-IncFII-plasmids.

Low MIC(90) values were found for metronidazole (0.5 mg/L), vancomycin (1.0 mg/L), teicoplanin (0.125 mg/L), fusidic acid (1.0 mg/L), linezolid (2.0 mg/L), daptomycin (2.0 mg/L) and tigecycline (0.064 mg/L). Three isolates (0.5{\%}) had elevated MICs for vancomycin (4-8 mg/L); however, these isolates originated from the same patient, who was receiving long-term intravenous vancomycin treatment. High-level clindamycin resistant isolates (MIC {\textgreater}256 mg/L) peaked in 1997 with 39 of 95 (41{\%}) and out of these, 36{\%} were also highly resistant to erythromycin. beta-Lactams such as penicillin V and piperacillin displayed MIC(90)s of 8 and 32 mg/L, respectively, whereas MICs of cefuroxime were {\textgreater}256 mg/L for all isolates. Universal resistance to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin was found, and resistance to moxifloxacin increased from 4{\%} of isolates in 2004 to 23{\%} in 2007. Notably, these moxifloxacin-resistant isolates did not belong to the recent epidemic PCR ribotype 027, but to the pre-existing epidemic type 012 (82{\%}), and these isolates accounted for the majority of isolates that were resistant to clindamycin (70{\%}), tetracycline (84{\%}) and rifampicin (92{\%}) as well.

We characterized the 47 isolates of a strain cluster of ST4378, a genotype that differs in the porB sequence by only one nucleotide from ST1407, in Taiwan during April 2006 to June 2012. METHODS: We identified 47 ST4378 isolates among our 2357 total isolates from the Gonococci-National Isolate Collection for Epidemiology. The corresponding patients' medical records were collected. The 47 isolates were further typed by multilocus sequence typing. Genes involved in beta-lactam (ponA), quinolone (gyrA and parC) and multidrug (mtrR, porB1b and pilQ) resistance were sequenced. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the disc diffusion test and Etest. RESULTS: Cefixime MICs for the 47 isolates ranged from 0.016 to 0.19 mg/L and ceftriaxone MICs ranged from 0.012 to 0.094 mg/L. Forty-six of the 47 isolates had a mosaic penA allele type XXXIV and one had a new allele type XL, which appeared to be a recombinant of mosaic penA type XXXIV and non-mosaic penA type II. All of the isolates harboured nearly identical polymorphism in the ponA, gyrA, parC, mtrR, porB1b and pilQ genes. Among the 33 patients with known medical records, 25 (76{\%}) were men who have sex with men (MSM), 3 (9{\%}) were bisexual and 5 (15{\%}) were heterosexual. Fourteen (42{\%}) of the 33 patients had HIV, 8 (24{\%}) had syphilis and 7 (21{\%}) had both infections. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of a cluster of ST1407-related strains in Taiwan. ST4378 is a genotype that may develop to cause third-generation cephalosporin treatment failures. Our results showed that ST4378 strains primarily transmitted in a high-risk MSM/bisexual network.

19147,maybe,shimono2013,article,"Introduction: Klebsiella pneumoniae is a type of Gram-negative bacteria belonging to Enterobacteriaceae, which can cause severe necrotizing pneumonia, urinary tract infections, biliary tract infections, and bloodstream infections (BSIs). K. pneumoniae infection occurs not only in community but also in hospital or health care environments. Some strains of K. pneumoniae have become resistant to various kinds of antibiotics, including cephalosporins and carbapenems. Besides the number of Extended-spectrum-betalactamase (ESBL) producing strains are increasing, carbapenemase such as Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) or New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM-1) producing strains have become a threat for the treatment in several countries. Objectives: The purpose of this study is to grasp and analyze the current situation of K. pneumoniae bloodstreaminfections in a single hospital in Japan. Methods: Our hospital is a university hospital having 1,200 beds, receiving patients with emergency, patients with solid tumor, hematological malignancies, and so on. From January 2008 through December 2012, a total number of 107 strains of K. pneumoniae were isolated from blood cultures. We studied on the background of these patients retrospectively; risk factors, possible source of infection, presence of central venous catheters, possible place of infection (community or hospital acquired), prognosis, antimicrobial susceptibility, and so on. Results: Eighty percent of these patients were hospital acquired. They had malignancies as underlying diseases, especially hematological malignancies (29.9{\%}). BSIs recurred in 6.5{\%} with intervals between 31 and 153 days. ESBL producing strains were isolated in 12 cases (11.2 {\%}) and only 1 strainwas resistant against carbapenems.

12601,maybe,lu2015,article,"The preferred drugs for the treatment of syphilis, benzathine and procaine penicillin, have not been available in Shanghai for many years, and currently, the incidence of syphilis is increasing. Alternative antibiotics for patients with syphilis during the benzathine and procaine penicillin shortage include macrolides. The failure of macrolide treatment in syphilis patients has been reported in Shanghai, but the reason for this treatment failure remains unclear. We used polymerase chain reaction technology to detect a 23S rRNA A2058G mutation in Treponema pallidum in 109 specimens from syphilis patients. The use of azithromycin/erythromycin in the syphilis patients and the physicians' prescription habits were also assessed based on two questionnaires regarding the use of macrolides. A total of 104 specimens (95.4{\%}) were positive for the A2058G mutation in both copies of the 23S rRNA gene, indicating macrolide resistance. A questionnaire provided to 122 dermatologists showed that during the penicillin shortage, they prescribed erythromycin and azithromycin for 8.24Â¬Â±13.95{\%} and 3.21Â¬Â±6.37{\%} of their patients, respectively, and in the case of penicillin allergy, erythromycin and azithromycin were prescribed 15.24Â¬Â±22.89{\%} and 7.23Â¬Â±16.60{\%} of the time, respectively. A second questionnaire provided to the syphilis patients showed that 150 (33.7{\%}), 106 (23.8{\%}) and 34 (7.6{\%}) individuals had used azithromycin, erythromycin or both, respectively, although the majority did not use the drugs for syphilis treatment. Our findings suggest that macrolide resistance in Treponema pallidum is widespread in Shanghai.

53,yes,abebe2012,article,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of drug resistant tuberculosis (TB) in Ethiopia in general, and Jimma area in particular, is not well documented. We conducted a study at Jimma University specialized hospital in southwest Ethiopia among new cases of smear positive TB patients to determine the pattern of resistance to first-line drugs. METHODS: A health institution based cross sectional study was conducted from November 2010 to September 2011. Any newly diagnosed smear positive TB patient 18 years and above was included in the study. Demographic and related data were collected by trained personnel using a pretested structured questionnaire. Mycobacterial drug susceptibility testing (DST) to the first line drugs isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RIF), ethambutol (EMB) and streptomycin (STM) was performed on cultures using the indirect proportion method. M. tuberculosis complex (MTBC) was identified with the Capilia TB-Neo test. RESULTS: 136 patients were enrolled in the study. Resistance to at least one drug was identified in 18.4{\%}. The highest prevalence of resistance to any drug was identified against INH (13.2{\%}) followed by STM (8.1{\%}). There was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of any resistance by sex, age, HIV status and history of being imprisoned. The highest mono resistance was observed against INH (7.4{\%}). Mono resistance to streptomycin was associated with HIV infection (crude OR 15.63, 95{\%}CI: 1.31, 187). Multidrug-resistance TB (MDR-TB) was observed in two patients (1.5{\%}). CONCLUSION: Resistance to at least one drug was 18.4{\%} (INH-13.2{\%} and STM-8.1{\%}). STM resistance was associated with HIV positivity. There was relatively low prevalence of MDR-TB yet INH resistance was common around Jimma. The capacity of laboratories for TB culture and DST should be strengthened, in order to correctly manage TB patients and avoid amplification of drug resistance.",G Abebe and K Abdissa and A Abdissa and L Apers and M Agonafir and B C De-Jong and R Colebunders,1756-0500,BMC Res Notes,"*Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial,Adolescent,Adult,Antitubercular Agents/*therapeutic use,Coinfection,Cross-Sectional Studies,Ethambutol/therapeutic use,Ethiopia/epidemiology,Female,HIV Infections/epidemiology,Humans,Isoniazid/therapeutic use,Logistic Models,Male,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Middle Aged,Mycobacterium tuberculosis/drug effects/isolation,Odds Ratio,Prevalence,Rifampin/therapeutic use,Risk Assessment,Risk Factors,Sputum/microbiology,Streptomycin/therapeutic use,Tuberculosis, Multidrug-Resistant/*diagnosis/*drug,Tuberculosis, Pulmonary/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/e,Young Adult",225,{Relatively low primary drug resistant tuberculosis in southwestern Ethiopia},NA,5,2012,NA,"1756-0500

Methods We investigated cases of azithromycin-resistant gonorrhoea detected at Public Health - Seattle and King County STD Clinic between January 2014 and February 2015. In 2012- 2013, zero of 237 MSM urethral isolates were azithromycinresistant. The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) do not define an azithromycin-resistance breakpoint. CDC uses âÃ¢â¢2 mcg/mL as an 'Alert Value' minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) (here called resistant). We used agar dilution to determine MICs. Results Of 179 urethral, 83 pharyngeal and 87 rectal isolates from MSM, 11 (6.1{\%}), 6 (7.2{\%}) and 5 (5.7{\%}) had azithromycin MIC âÃ¢â¢2 mcg/mL, respectively. We identified no cases of azithromycin- resistance among 56 heterosexuals. Overall, 19 (6.9{\%}) of 276 MSM with culture-positive gonorrhoea had an azithromycin- resistant isolate. The median azithromycin MIC was 4.0 mcg/mL (range 2 to {\textgreater}256 mcg/mL). Eight patients- isolates also demonstrated tetracycline resistance (MIC âÃ¢â¢2 mcg/mL); one was ciprofloxacin-resistant (MIC 16.0 mcg/mL). None exhibited reduced susceptibility to cefixime or ceftriaxone.

7483,yes,gomez-gil2009,article,"We describe 12 cases of linezolid-resistant Enterococcus faecalis. The present study was done in 2 wards of Hospital Universitario La Paz in Madrid, Spain. The 2 wards involved were the intensive care unit (ICU) and reanimation unit. Twelve clinical strains of E. faecalis reported by the clinical laboratory as linezolid resistant based on MICs determined by E-test (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden) were collected between September 2005 and October 2006. The MIC of linezolid for all the resistant isolates was {\textgreater}128 microg/mL. The isolates were analyzed for the presence of the G2576T mutation by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and pyrosequencing. Pyrosequencing showed that the first isolate had G and T at position 2576 in a 1:1 ratio, whereas the remaining ones had a wild type to mutant ratio of 1:3. PCR-RFLP showed that the mutations were in alleles 1, 3, and 4. The 12 isolates under investigation came from different patients but were indistinguishable by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (n = 7) and repetitive extragenic palindromic sequence (REP)-PCR (n = 12). This is the first report of a clonal outbreak of linezolid-resistant E. faecalis in Spain. To prevent or minimize the emergence of resistance, we should use linezolid strictly after the therapeutic indications, courses of treatment should be kept as short as possible, and risk factors for resistance development should be considered before starting. In addition, we suggest that susceptibility testing of clinically significant Gram-positive pathogens should be done in all cases of treatment failure, and, depending on the local epidemiology of each ICU, it might be advisable to do it before starting treatment with linezolid.",R Gomez-Gil and M P Romero-Gomez and A Garcia-Arias and M G Ubeda and M S Busselo and R Cisterna and A Gutierrez-Altes and J Mingorance,0732-8893,Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis,"*Disease Outbreaks,*Drug Resistance, Bacterial,Acetamides/*pharmacology,Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology,Bacterial Typing Techniques,Cluster Analysis,Cross Infection/*epidemiology/microbiology,DNA Fingerprinting,DNA, Bacterial/genetics,DNA, Ribosomal/genetics,Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field,Enterococcus faecalis/*drug effects/isolation {\&} pu,Female,Genotype,Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections/*epidemiology/m,Hospitals,Humans,Linezolid,Male,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Middle Aged,Oxazolidinones/*pharmacology,Point Mutation,Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods,Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length,Sequence Analysis, DNA,Spain,Young Adult",175--179,{Nosocomial outbreak of linezolid-resistant Enterococcus faecalis infection in a tertiary care hospital},NA,65,2009,2,"1879-0070

11875,maybe,leitner2015,article,"OBJECTIVES: An increase of severe infections caused by Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (SDSE) similar to infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes has been reported over the last years. Little is known about infections with SDSE in Austria. Therefore, we investigated a collection of 113 SDSE invasive and non-invasive isolates from different infection sites and type of infections as well as patients' characteristics. METHODS: The isolates were phenotypically identified and emm typed using the enlarged emm database from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Additionally, 13 antimicrobial agents were tested using EUCAST guidelines and virulence genes were investigated. RESULTS: Severe SDSE infections were most common in elderly men with underlying diseases especially diabetes mellitus. With VitekMS identification of SDSE isolates was successful to the species level only. Emm typing revealed 24 different emm types, one new type and one new subtype. StG485, stG6, stC74a, stG643, and stG480 were the predominant types in this study, stC74a and stG652 in invasive infections and stG643, stC74a and stG485 in non-invasive infections. Resistance was observed to tetracycline (62{\%}), macrolides (13{\%}) with one M phenotype, and clindamycin (12{\%}) presenting 6 constitutive MLS(B) phenotypes and 8 inducible MLS(B) phenotypes. Levofloxacin resistance was detected only in one isolate. All isolates tested for virulence genes were positive for scpA, ska, saga and slo. Superantigenic genes were negative except speG(dys) (positive 17/34; 50{\%}). CONCLUSION: This paper presents the first report of SDSE infections in Austria. Severe SDSE infections were found mainly in elderly men with underlying diseases. SDSE isolates demonstrated substantial emm type diversity without association with infections site or invasiveness.

21052,yes,traore2012,article,"OBJECTIVE: To identify strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) circulating in Bamako and to examine the relationship between the strains and their drug susceptibility profiles. METHODS: Between 2006 and 2010, we conducted a cross-sectional study using spoligotyping to identify strains of MTC recovered from 126 tuberculosis (TB) patients under treatment in Bamako, Mali. RESULT: Three members of the MTC were isolated: M. tuberculosis (71.4{\%}), M. africanum (27.8{\%}) and M. bovis (0.8{\%}). Of these, three strains were found to be the most prevalent: M. tuberculosis T1 (MTB T1; 38.9{\%}), M. africanum F2 (MAF2; 26.2{\%}) and M. tuberculosis Latin American and Mediterranean 10 (MTB LAM 10; 10.3{\%}). MAF2 and MTB LAM 10 strains have a lower risk of multidrug resistance (MDR) than MTB T1 (respectively OR 0.1, 95{\%}CI 0.03-0.4 and OR 0.1, 95{\%}CI 0.01-0.8).

1829,maybe,bele2014,article,"Multi drug resistant bacteria are emerging world wide as a threat to the favorable outcome of common infections in society and hospital settings. Production of $\beta$-lactamase enzyme by several gram negative and gram positive strains of bacteria is perhaps the most important single mechanism of resistance to penicillin's and cephalosporins. In the earlier days of antibiotic generation it was believed that cephalosporins were relatively immune to attack by $\beta$- lactamases, but it was surprising to find cephalosporin resistant Klebsiella spp. among the clinical isolates. The mechanism of this resistance was production of extended spectrum $\beta$-lactamases (ESBLs). So study was carried out on the ESBL isolates and their relative sensitivity against various generations and types of antibiotics from ICU of tertiary care. The study showed surprising results revealing the presence of ESBL in patients' samples. The most ESBL producing bacteria were E.coli, K.pneumoniae and Enterobacter species. The patients with longer stay in hospital were more prone to these diseases. Many of these were found out to be resistant to more than two antibiotics/drugs. They were categorized as MDRO.

METHODS: Sixty one carbapenem resistant clinical isolates of a total of 212 P. aeruginosa isolates cultured during the study period were screened for the presence of NDM-1by PCR. Clinical characteristics of the NDM-1 positive isolates were studied and outcome of the patients was followed up. RESULTS: Of the 61 isolates, NDM-1 was detected in four isolates only. These were isolated from patients in the intensive care units and chest medicine ward. The source specimens were pus, sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage and endotracheal aspirate. The NDM-1 producers were susceptible only to polymyxin B. Only one patient responded to polymyxin B therapy, while the others succumbed to the infection.

15553,maybe,ongen2013,article,"Introduction: Aeromonas spp. are emerging agents of gastroenteritis. Since most of the species produce inducible type chromosomal betalactamase, resistance can develop during beta-lactam therapy [1]. Objectives: It was aimed to investigate the frequency of Aeromonas spp. in stool samples of patients with gastroenteritis between January 2007 and June 2012 and to determine their antibiotic susceptibilities. Methods: Stool samples were inoculated onto 5{\%} sheep blood agar, MacConkey agar, Hektoen enteric agar, selenite F and Gram negative broth.Media were incubated aerobically at 35-37Â°C. Oxidase positive Gram negative rods on blood agar were investigated for Aeromonas spp. by API 32 GN and VITEK 2 systems (bioM{\'{e}}rieux). Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ampicillin-sulbactam, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefoxitine, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, imipenem, meropenem, ertapenem, aztreonam, gentamicin, amikacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, co-trimoxazole, tetracycline and chloramphenicol susceptibilities were determined by disc diffusion method according to CLSI M45-A2 criteria [2]. Results: 60 (0.6{\%}) Aeromonas spp. were isolated from 10,666 stool samples. Between 2007-2012; Aeromonas spp. was isolated at the rates of 0.4{\%}, 0.12{\%}, 0.45{\%}, 0.2{\%}, 1.1{\%} and 0.7{\%} respectively. Fortythree (72{\%}) isolates were identified as A. hydrophila/caviae, 8 (13{\%}) as A. sobria, 3 (5{\%}) as A. veronii and 6 (10{\%}) as Aeromonas spp. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes were positive for 25{\%} of the samples in which Aeromonas was isolated. Of the stool samples in which Aeromonas spp. was isolated, approximately 3/4 were watery with mucus and 6{\%} were watery with blood and mucus.

These isolates comprise two major epidemic pulsed-field electrophoresis-defined clones plus two minor clones. In addition to the ESBL-mediated resistance, all strains uniformly showed resistance to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin and tobramycin. The beta-lactamases involved in this resistance phenotype were TEM-1, SHV-1, and CTX-M-15, as demonstrated by isoelectric focusing, PCR amplification, and sequencing. TEM-1 and CTX-M-15 beta-lactamases, as well as the aminoglycoside resistance determinants, were encoded in plasmids that could be transferred to Escherichia coli by conjugation. In three of the infected patients with the predominant clone, cefoxitin resistance development (MICs {\textgreater}128 mg/L) was documented. The analysis of the outer membrane proteins of the cefoxitin-susceptible and cefoxitin-resistant isolates revealed that the former expressed only one of the two major porins, OmpK36, whereas in the latter, the expression of Ompk36 was altered or abolished. This is the first report of CTX-M-15-producing K. pneumoniae in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

3621,yes,chen2009b,article,"Objective: To investigate the mechanism of carbapenem resistance and the occurrence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants qnr and aac(6â²)-Ib-cr in a clinical isolate of Enterobacter cloacae. Methods: An ertapenem-resistant E. cloacae ZY106, which was isolated from liquor puris of a female gastric cancer patient in a Chinese hospital, was investigated. Antibiotic susceptibilities were determined by agar dilution method. Conjugation experiments, isoelectric focusing, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and DNA sequence analyses of plasmid-mediated carbapenemases and quinolone resistance determinants were preformed to confirm the genotype. Outer membrane proteins (OMPs) were examined by urea-sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Urea-SDS-PAGE). Results: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of imipenem, meropenem, and ertapenem for ZY106 were 2, 4, and 16 $\mu$g/ml, respectively. Conjugation studies with Escherichia coli resulted in the transfer of significantly reduced carbapenem susceptibility. ZY106 produced IMP-1 metallo-$\beta$-lactamase and CTX-M-3 extended-spectrum $\beta$-lactamase, and E. coli transconjugant produced IMP-1. Plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinant qnrS1 was detected in ZY106. Transfer of the qnrS1-encoding-plasmid into E. coli by conjugation resulted in intermediate resistance to ciprofloxacin in E. coli transconjugant. Urea-SDS-PAGE analysis of OMPs showed that ZY106 lacked an OMP of approximately 38 kDa. Conclusion: It is the first IMP-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae in China and the first report of a clinical isolate that harbors both blaIMP and qnrS genes as well. The blaIMP-1, blaCTX-M-3, and qnrS1 are encoded at three different plasmids. IMP-1 combined with the loss of an OMP possibly resulted in ertapenem resistance and reduced imipenem and meropenem susceptibility in E. cloacae. {\textcopyright} Zhejiang University and Springer-Verlag GmbH 2009.",L R Chen and H W Zhou and J C Cai and R Zhang and G X Chen,"1673-1581

5811,maybe,elhani2015,article,"Tetracycline resistance has been postulated as a potential phenotypic marker of livestockassociated lineage ST398 amongst meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clinical isolates in some European hospitals. The objective of this study was to determine if this marker could also be applied to Maghrebian countries. In total, 99 MRSA isolates were collected in a Tunisian hospital during January 2011âOctober 2012, and 24 tetracycline-resistant MRSA isolates of this collection were characterized. All isolates were tested for antimicrobial resistance phenotypes and genotypes, molecular typing, and virulence genes. Multilocus sequence typing showed that the majority of the isolates (19/24) belonged to clonal complex CC8 (ST247, n512 isolates; ST239, n56isolates; ST241, n51 isolate). The remaining isolates belonged to CC398 (ST398, n51 isolate), CC5 (ST5 and ST641, n52 isolates), and CC80 (ST728, n52 isolates). Spa typing discriminated MRSA in eight spa types: t052 (n512 isolates), t037 (n55 isolates), t044 (n52 isolates), and t899, t129, t311, t1744 and the new t14712 (n51 isolate each). Three agr groups were found amongst the studied isolates: agr group I (n520 isolates), agr group II (n52) and agr group III (n52 isolates). We report the detection of one MRSA ST398ât899 isolate in the nasal sample of a farmer patient in Tunisia, representing the first report of ST398 in humans in Africa. Tetracycline resistance seems not to be a good phenotypic marker for MRSA ST398 strains in Tunisia, where CC8 was the most prevalent lineage.

Methods: Aliquots from residual specimens obtained from symptomatic (urethritis) and asymptomatic men at ages 18- 52 years, enrolled from seven diverse US clinical sites, including obstetrics and gynecology, family planning, public health and sexually transmitted disease clinics, were tested using a research-use-only transcription mediated amplification (TMA) assay for Mgen (Hologic, Inc.). First-catch urine or urethral swab specimens positive for Mgen by TMAwere evaluated by reverse transcription-PCR and Sanger sequencing of Mgen 23s ribosomal RNA, or mRNA from parC and gyrA genes to identify the presence of macrolide and fluoroquinolone antibiotic resistance-associated mutations (MT- 23s, MT-gyrA, MT-parC, respectively). Results: Of 50 Mgen TMA-positive subjects, 21 (42{\%}) harbored MT-23s mutations at position 2058 (A2058G, A2058C, A2058T) or position 2059 (A2059G). Of these 21, nine subjects (42.9{\%}) were symptomatic. MT-23s mutations were more prevalent in subjects co-infected with Chlamydia (3/8, 37.5{\%}) compared to subjects infected with Mgen alone (3/22, 13.6{\%}). Of 15 subjects with gryA sequencing results, three (20{\%}) had MT-gyrA, while nine of 25 (36{\%}) had MT-parC. Finally, of nine subjects with 23s, gyrA and parC sequencing results, two (22.2{\%}) had MT-23s and either MT-gyrA or MT-parC.

4379,maybe,creighton2013,article,"Staphylococcus saprophyticus is commonly observed in the clinical laboratory as a causative agent of uncomplicated urinary tract infections, most often encountered in young female patients in primary care. It is usually susceptible to antimicrobials used to treat simple cystitis, although resistance, particularly to $\beta$-lactams, has been reported internationally. However, the true resistance prevalence may be underestimated as susceptibility testing for S. saprophyticus is not recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). We report the isolation of a methicillin-and multi-resistant S. saprophyticus and a two year retrospective investigation of S. saprophyticus clinical isolates which revealed the presence of S. saprophyticus infections outside of the urogenital tract and the existence of other multi-resistant isolates.

METHODS: A 77-year-old white man with end-stage multiple myeloma was hospitalized for congestive heart failure and pneumonia. During hospitalization, the patient developed conjunctivitis. Cultures of the eye were directly plated into several media. The bacterium was tested for antibiotic minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) with the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) method. RESULTS: Culture of the affected eye grew Enterococcus faecalis resistant to vancomycin. Topical treatment with moxifloxacin 0.5{\%} (Vigamox; Alcon, Ft. Worth, TX) resulted in clinical resolution despite a MIC showing resistance. CONCLUSION: Clinical resolution of VRE conjunctivitis was shown with topical moxifloxacin therapy in this case. At the same time, we suggest the use of combined topical and systemic therapy for treatment of VRE in immunocompromised patients.

Thirty-two patients acquired the outbreak strain in five intensive care units (ICUs) and two regular wards at a tertiary care hospital within 10 months. The outbreak strain was resistant to penicillins, cephalosporins, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, imipenem and meropenem, and carried the blaOXA-23-like gene. Based on PFGE and rep-PCR typing, it was shown to be related to the pan-European A. baumannii clone II. The most likely mode of transmission was cross-transmission from colonized or infected patients via the hands of health-care workers, with the severity of disease and intensity of care (therapeutic intervention scoring system 28 score .median) being independently associated with acquisition of the outbreak strain (odds ratio 6.67, 95{\%} confidence interval 1.55-36.56). Control of the outbreak was achieved by enforcement of standard precautions, education of personnel, screening of ICU patients for carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii and cohorting of patients.

1449,yes,banerjee2014b,article,"Introduction: Stenotrophomonas multophilia is a ubiquitous organism, which has emerged as an opportunistic pathogen mainly in the immune compromised host. This organism is not a virulent pathogen, but has an amazing ability to survive in a wide range of environments. It is frequently multi resistant to antibiotics. Objectives: The main objectives of our study were to report the emergence of S. multophilia and the risk factors associated for acquiring the pathogen in adult immune compromised patients who were admitted in intensive care unit (ICU) of Apollo Gleneagles Hospital, Kolkata. Materials and Methods: Over an 18 month period of time starting from January 2012 to August 2013, 48 patients were diagnosed to have infection with S. multophilia. Most of these patients had lower respiratory tract infections and few had reported bacteremia as well with this pathogen. All these patients were treated in our ICU and the surveillance was carried out to detect possible source from medical devices (indwelling) that were used.

Italy is usually considered a country characterized by a low prevalence of MDR S. pneumoniae. We describe the occurrence of bacterial meningitis sustained by a MDR S. pneumoniae strain in Italy. The first-line treatment was started with ceftriaxone and dexamethasone, but after the identification of such a resistant strain a second-line regimen was needed. The new regimen was chosen on both susceptibility and pharmacokinetic criteria. Linezolid and levofloxacin were started and a dramatic improvement was observed. A more sensitive anamnesis revealed some elements known to be associated to a MDR S. pneumoniae occurrence (immunesuppression, former antibiotic therapy). So this case should pinpoint our attention on risk factors of MDR for a careful choice of antibiotic therapy in serious pneumococcal infections. {\textcopyright} 2014 Edizioni Scientifiche per l'Informazione su Farmaci e Terapia.",G Cenderello and E Pontali and A Torresin and G Milano and F Ansaldi and M Feasi and D Usiglio and M Mori and G Icardi and G Cassola,"1973-9478

The New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) is a major problem around the world. The purpose of this article is to address the NDM-1 Klebsiella pneumoniae epidemic detected in eight cases in our hospital. METHODS: Bacteria identified in this epidemic were from patients already admitted to the intensive care unit of the Sakarya University Training and Research Hospital during efforts toward establishment of infection surveillance and control program. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of strains was performed using the VITEK 2 system (bioMerieux, France), E-test gradient strips (bioMerieux, France), and the disc diffusion test. For the metallo-beta-lactamase activity, the combined disc diffusion test and modified Hodge test as phenotypic tests were performed. To identify the resistance gene, the Xpert Carba-R kit (Cepheid Inc., USA) and an in-house multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method designed for five common carbapenemase genes (IMP, VIM, KPC, NDM-1, and OXA-48) were employed. The clonal relationship of these strains was explored by the repetitive PCR (rep-PCR, DiversiLab System, bioMerieux, France) method. RESULTS: During the December 2014 to March 2015 period, NDM-1 positive K. pneumoniae strains were detected in eight patients. All of these strains were found to produce NDM-1, while two of them also revealed the presence of OXA-48. The rep-PCR results reveal a clonal proximity of 95 {\%} for six of the eight strains. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest the tendency of NDM-1-producing strains to spread in our country as well. A carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae threat may pose a great risk to our country.

This study provides a comprehensive overview of the molecular epidemiology and genetic diversity of S. aureus strains at the largest university clinic in Ibadan, Nigeria. From 1,300 patients' clinical samples collected at the University Teaching Hospital in Ibadan, Nigeria, during a 1-year-surveillance in 2007, 346 nonduplicate S. aureus isolates were obtained. All isolates underwent antibiotic susceptibility testing, toxin gene analysis, multilocus sequence typing, agr group typing, and spa typing. For methicillin (meticillin)-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing was also performed. Of the 346 isolates, 20.23{\%} were methicillin resistant. Thirty-three patients' isolates (47.15{\%}) fulfilled the definition criteria for community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) according to a review of the medical charts. The majority of MRSA strains analyzed were isolated from surgical or pediatric patients. The commonest types of MRSA infection identified were surgical-site infections ({\textgreater}70{\%}), whereas those for CA-MRSA were conjunctivitis and otitis (19 patients [57.6{\%}]) and accidental skin and subcutaneous tissue infections (14 patients [42.4{\%}]). The methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strains (ST1, ST5, ST15, ST7, ST8, ST25, ST30, ST72, ST80, ST121, and ST508) were heterogeneous by phenotypic and genotypic analyses. The first report of a Panton-Valentine leukocidin-positive ST88 strain (agr III, SCCmec IV) in Nigeria, as well as genetic analyses of this strain, is presented in this study. The ST88 strain was resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole as well as to penicillin and oxacillin.

3518,maybe,chatterjee2016,article,"Background: Acinetobacter species are a heterogeneous group of organisms that have emerged as significant nosocomial pathogens affecting patients with impaired host defenses. Newborns, particularly are very prone to hospital acquired infections. Till date, A. baumannii has been predominantly implicated in neonatal sepsis but äóìother speciesäó within the genus have been reported rarely. The persistence of endemic Acinetobacter strains in hospitals seems to be related to their widespread resistance to antimicrobial agents. Since carbapenems are last resort antibiotics, this study evaluated the dissemination of carbapenem-resistant genes in cases of neonatal septicemia. Methods {\&} Materials: Acinetobacter spp. from blood of septicemic neonates was identified by ARDRA and susceptibility tests were carried out by VITEK 2 system. Extended-spectrum $\beta$- lactamases, AmpCs, oxacillinases and metallo-$\beta$-lactamases were detected phenotypically and genotypically and were subsequently sequenced. Pulso-typing and plasmid characterization were also carried out. Results: A. baumannii was found to be predominant genospecies (72{\%}) followed by A. calcoaceticus, A. lwoffii, 13TU, A. junni, 15TU, A. haemolyticus and 14TU over the 7 years period. Fifty four percent of the total isolates were meropenem-resistant. Comparative analysis of susceptibility tests revealed that carbapenem resistance (meropenem, imipenem) and aminoglycoside resistance (amikacin, gentamicin) was significantly lower in other species of Acinetobacter against ACB (A. calcoaceticus-baumannii) complex. The most prevalent oxacillinases were OXA-51-like (74{\%}), OXA-23-like (50{\%}) and OXA-58-like (15{\%}). New Delhi metallo- $\beta$-lactamase-1 was the dominant MBL (22{\%}). NDM-1-harbouring isolates also possessed blaVIM-2, blaPER-1, blaVEB-2, blaCTX-M-15, armA, aac(6')Ib, aac(6')Ib-cr gene in various combinations. These isolates were clonally diverse (Figure 1) and harboured plasmids of different sizes. Conclusion: This study documents the emergence of Acinetobacter spp. in the nosocomial environment and also the significance of different genospecies of Acinetobacter causing neonatal sepsis over an extended period of time. A unique assessment of the diverse genetic determinants for carbapenem resistance was noted. The emergence of NDM-1 among an already existing repertoire of oxacillinases is a challenge for clinicians and microbiologists alike. As new resistance mechanisms constantly evolve both laboratory detection systems and infection control measures need to be enhanced.

We report the emergence of the newly described resistance mechanism conferred by New Delhi metallo-$\beta$-lactamase 1 (NDM-1) in Austria. NDM-1 positive Enterobacteriaceae (2x Klebsiella pneumoniae and 1x E. coli) has been detected in three patients at the University Hospital of Graz, Austria, with all three cases occurring within the last 6 months. Methods: NDM-1 shares very little identity with other metallob- lactamase (MBL) enzymes and Enterobacteriaceae with NDM-1 show high resistance to nearly all commonly used antibiotics. Primers for PCR detection of NDM-1 were designed based on GenBank (National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) database entry AB571289.1 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/300422615). Results: NDM-1 was detected in isolates of three patients, in two cases in K. pneumoniae, and one patient with NDM-1 positive E. coli. All threecases occurred between December 2009 and August 2010. Patient one (NDM-1 K. pneumoniae), a 30-year-old Austrian male was admitted to our University Hospital in November 2009. History revealed that he had suffered multiple open fractures of his upper and lower left leg and rectal laceration due to a motorcycle accident in Pakistan. In patient two the NDM-1 K. pneumoniae was detected in August 2010, the patient being a 14-year-old Kosovarian boy transferred from Kosovo to the Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Graz, with multiple intraabdominal abscess formations and peritonitis. He had undergone appendectomy in Pristina, Kosovo, in April 2010 and had developed abdominal sepsis consecutively. Patient number three (NDM-1 E. coli), a 56 year old male developed a necrotizing fasciitis when being in India in January 2010, after a short admittance at a hospital in New Delhi the patient was transferred to Austria. Conclusion: Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae with the newly described resistance enzyme NDM-1 have been recently shown to pose the potential of growing to a major public health problem worldwide. We report the emergence of NDM-1 among Enterobacteriaceae in Austria.

This work investigated the presence of NTM in sputum samples of 129 CF patients (2 to 18 years old) submitted to longitudinal clinical supervision at a regional reference center in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. From June 2009 to March 2012, 36 NTM isolates recovered from 10 (7.75{\%}) out of 129 children were obtained. Molecular identification of NTM was performed by using PCR restriction analysis targeting the hsp65 gene (PRA-hsp65) and sequencing of the rpoB gene, and susceptibility tests were performed that followed Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute recommendations. For evaluating the genotypic diversity, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and/or enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequence PCR (ERIC-PCR) was performed. The species identified were Mycobacterium abscessus subsp. bolletii (n = 24), M. abscessus subsp. abscessus (n = 6), Mycobacterium fortuitum (n = 3), Mycobacterium marseillense (n = 2), and Mycobacterium timonense (n = 1). Most of the isolates presented resistance to five or more of the antimicrobials tested. Typing profiles were mainly patient specific. The PFGE profiles indicated the presence of two clonal groups for M. abscessus subsp. abscessus and five clonal groups for M. abscesssus subsp. bolletii, with just one clone detected in two patients.

Clonal analysis (XbaI pulsed-field gel electrophoresis) revealed that all K. pneumoniae isolates belonged to the same clone, but 6 patterns were found among the E. cloacae isolates. Carbapenems were affected to different degrees (minimum inhibitory concentration, {\textless} or = 1 to {\textgreater} 8 microg/mL), as were aminoglycosides and ciprofloxacin.

16191,maybe,paulo2015,article,"BACKGROUND-AIM Raoultella ornithinolytica was first described in 1989 by Sakazaki Et al. This bacterium is a gram-negative encapsulated aerobic bacillus belonging to family Enterobacteriaceae that is found in aquatic environments. It has the ability to convert histidine to histamine so the infection with this microorganism causes lesions of redness and flushing of the skin. There are only a few reports of human infection by R. ornithinolytica in the literature. METHODS A 33-year-old caucasian male came to our ER due to extensive edema and redness in the left hand after trauma, also presenting fever (38,6C). The patient's medical history is very important because he is haemophilic, hepatitis C positive and has a drug addiction background. The CT scan showed difused edema of the subcutaneous cellular tissue without signs of fracture or necrosis. RESULTS The collection of a sample of pus, cultures and then identification with Vitek 2 System ( BioM{\'{e}}rieux, France), made possible to isolate Raoutella ornythinolytica resistant to Ampicillin and sensible to Amoxicillin + Clavulanic acid, Cefuroxime, Gentamicin and Ciprofloxacin. Flucloxacillin empirical antimicrobial therapy was then switched to amoxicilin + clavulanic acid for 13 days. After the patient presented a new episode of fever we made new cultures that provided the isolation of Enterobacter cloacae sp resistant to Ampicillin, Amoxicillin + Clavulanic acid and sensible to Cefuroxime, Gentamicin and Ciprofloxacin. There was a good clinical evolution with antibiotic treatment and local care of the lesion, and his analytical status significantly improved: white blood cell count of 7,7ÍÜ10 9/L, hemoglobin of 12,6 g/dL, platelet count of 226000ÍÜ10 9/L, serum sodium of 142 mEq/L, potassium of 5.3 mEq/L, urea of 40 mEq/L, and creatinine of 0,61 mg/dL.

14062,maybe,mishra2013b,article,"BACKGROUND: Infections caused by bacteria such as multidrug resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter spp. and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) constitute a worldwide pandemic. Without gathering information about these strains, we cannot reduce the morbidity and mortality due to infections caused by these notorious bugs. METHODS: This study was conducted to identify the status of MDR Acinetobacter spp. and MRSA in a tertiary care centre of Nepal. Sputum, endotracheal aspirate and bronchial washing specimens were collected and processed from patients suspected of lower respiratory tract infection following standard microbiological methods recommended by the American Society for Microbiology (ASM). Double disk synergy test method was employed for the detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) in Acinetobacter isolates. Methicillin resistance in S. aureus was confirmed by using cefoxitin and oxacillin disks. RESULTS: Different genomespecies of Acinetobacter were isolated; these consisted of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus baumannii complex and A. lwoffii. Around 95{\%} of Acinetobacter isolates were MDR, while 12.9{\%} were ESBL-producer. Of the total 33 isolates of S. aureus, 26 (78.8{\%}) were MDR and 14 (42.4{\%}) were methicillin resistant.

14062,maybe,mishra2013b,article,"BACKGROUND: Infections caused by bacteria such as multidrug resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter spp. and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) constitute a worldwide pandemic. Without gathering information about these strains, we cannot reduce the morbidity and mortality due to infections caused by these notorious bugs. METHODS: This study was conducted to identify the status of MDR Acinetobacter spp. and MRSA in a tertiary care centre of Nepal. Sputum, endotracheal aspirate and bronchial washing specimens were collected and processed from patients suspected of lower respiratory tract infection following standard microbiological methods recommended by the American Society for Microbiology (ASM). Double disk synergy test method was employed for the detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) in Acinetobacter isolates. Methicillin resistance in S. aureus was confirmed by using cefoxitin and oxacillin disks. RESULTS: Different genomespecies of Acinetobacter were isolated; these consisted of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus baumannii complex and A. lwoffii. Around 95{\%} of Acinetobacter isolates were MDR, while 12.9{\%} were ESBL-producer. Of the total 33 isolates of S. aureus, 26 (78.8{\%}) were MDR and 14 (42.4{\%}) were methicillin resistant. CONCLUSIONS: A large number of MDR Acinetobacter spp. and MRSA has been noted in this study.

9323,maybe,iosifidis2012,article,"We present a polyclonal outbreak of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) colonization in a pediatric oncology department and the role of a bundle of actions. After the occurrence of VRE bloodstream infections in 2 patients, an active surveillance of VRE colonization was started. Enhanced infection control measures and closure of the department to new admissions for the first 3 months were implemented. Among 32 patients screened for VRE, 21 were found colonized. Daily prevalence of VRE colonization among hospitalized patients ranged from 40{\%} to 75{\%}, but no new VRE infections occurred. Monthly incidence of VRE colonization decreased from 2.5 to 0.6 cases per 100 occupied bed-days at the end of this outbreak by the implementation of the above-mentioned measures. All VRE isolates tested were Enterococcus faecium carrying VanA gene. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis showed a polyclonal outbreak. A case-control study did not show any particular risk factors for colonization. High use of glycopeptide was noted before study outbreak that was drastically decreased during the study but only temporarily. Control of VRE in pediatric oncology departments with high colonization rates is challenging and requires a multifaceted strategy. Polyclonal spread of VRE found in this study suggests a possible effect of prior antimicrobial overuse and the critical need for antimicrobial stewardship especially in the era of multidrug-resistant bacteria.

METHODS: The antibiotic susceptibility of 7814 enterobacteriaceae strains collected among patients, during 1997/1998 and 2006/2007 periods, were analysed as well as the consumption of the third generation cephalosporins, imipenem and fluoroquinolones.

The resistance by the ESBL production mechanism is predominant especially for Enterobacter cloacae and Escherichia coli.

Thus, antibacterial susceptibility data among intra-abdominal infection pathogens is important to define current prevalence of resistance. Methods: During 2009-2011, a total of 902 organisms derived from intra-abdominal sources, were isolated and susceptibility tested using Kirby-Bauer (KB) method, and tested for susceptibility to antibiotics according to the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. Results: Of the 902 clinical isolates, gramnegative bacilli and gram-positive cocci accounted for 83.6{\%} and 16.4{\%} respectively. Escherichia coli was the species isolated most commonly (41.4{\%}), and 8.6{\%} of these were extended-spectrum $\beta$-lactamase (ESBL)- positive. The other common pathogens were Klebsiella pneumonia (12.3{\%}), pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.8{\%}), acinetobacter baumannii (10.3{\%}) and staphylococci (6.9{\%}). ESBLs-producing strains accounted for 56.2{\%} and 52.5{\%} of escherichia coli and klebsiella spp. respectively. Methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) accounted for 44.7{\%} and methicillin-resistant coagulase negative staphylococci accounted for 38.2{\%} in staphylococcus aureus and coagulase negative staphylococci. Overall, Carbapenems were the antibiotic most active against enterobacteriaceae for which it has breakpoints ({\textgreater}96.6{\%}) followed by amikacin (91.0{\%}), and piperacillin-tazobactam (89.3{\%}), whereas rates of resistance to ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin were documented to be 29.7{\%}, 23.6{\%}, 21.5{\%}, and 20.1{\%}, respectively. Vancomycin was the most potent antimicrobial against gram positive cocci. Amphotericin B was the most active antibiotic against fungi. No vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus. aureus (VISA) or Vancomycinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA) isolate was found. Conclusions: This study documented substantial resistance to standard antimicrobial therapy among bacterial commonly isolated from intraabdominal infection in Northeast China.

869,yes,antoniadou2007,article,"OBJECTIVES: Infections due to multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative pathogens in the ICU have prompted the use of colistin, an antibiotic forgotten for decades. The aim of this retrospective observational study was to record and present the emergence of colistin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKB) in a Greek ICU. METHODS: In a new university tertiary hospital, the first patients admitted in the ICU were already colonized or infected with MDR pathogens, and this led to frequent colistin use as part of empirical or microbiologically documented therapy. Colistin resistance was defined as MIC {\textgreater}4 mg/L by the Etest method. All CRKB isolated in surveillance cultures or clinical specimens in the ICU during the period 2004-5 were recorded along with patients' characteristics. RESULTS: Eighteen CRKB were isolated from 13 patients over a 16 month period, representing either colonizing or infective isolates. Patients' mean age was 70 years, with a mean APACHE II score at admission of 22. They all had a long hospitalization (median 69 days) and a long administration of colistin (median 27 days). Colistin-resistant isolates were implicated as pathogens in two bacteraemias, a ventilator-associated pneumonia and two soft tissue infections. Repetitive extragenic palindromic PCR identified six distinct clones, and horizontal transmission was also documented. CONCLUSIONS: Selective pressure due to extensive or inadequate colistin use may lead to the emergence of colistin resistance among K. pneumoniae isolates, jeopardizing treatment options in the ICU, potentially increasing morbidity and mortality of critically ill patients and necessitating prudent use of colistin.",A Antoniadou and F Kontopidou and G Poulakou and E Koratzanis and I Galani and E Papadomichelakis and P Kopterides and M Souli and A Armaganidis and H Giamarellou,"0305-74531460-2091",Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy,",*Intensive Care Units,APACHE,Acinetobacter baumannii,Aged,Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology,Apache,Bacteremia/microbiology,Bacterial/*genetics,Colistin/*pharmacology,Drug Resistance,Drug Utilization,Etest,Female,Genes,Greece,Humans,Klebsiella Infections/*microbiology,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Klebsiella pneumoniae/*drug effects/*genetics,Male,Multigene Family/*genetics,Pseudomonas aeruginosa,Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction,aged,analytic method,animal cell,antibiotic resistance,article,bacteremia,bacterial colonization,bacterial infection,bacterium culture,bacterium isolate,bacterium isolation,clinical article,colistin,controlled study,critically ill patient,disease transmission,drug use,hospital admission,human,imipenem,intensive care unit,length of stay,medical decision making,minimum inhibitory concentration,morbidity,mortality,multidrug resistance,nonhuman,observational study,polymerase chain reaction,soft tissue infection,tetracycline,tigecycline,treatment duration,university hospital,ventilator associated pneumonia",786--790,{Colistin-resistant isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae emerging in intensive care unit patients: first report of a multiclonal cluster},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l47073420 http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jac/dkl562 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=03057453{\&}id=doi:10.1093{\%}2fjac{\%}2fdkl562{\&}atitle=colistin-resistant+isolates,59,2007,4,"from duplicate 2 (colistin-resistant isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae emerging in intensive care unit patients: first report of a multiclonal cluster - antoniadou, a; kontopidou, f; poulakou, g; koratzanis, e; galani, i; papadomichelakis, e; kopterides, p; souli, m; armaganidis, a; giamarellou, h)antoniadou, anastasiakontopidou, florapoulakou, garifaliakoratzanis, evangelosgalani, irenepapadomichelakis, evangeloskopterides, petrossouli, mariaarmaganidis, apostolosgiamarellou, helenjournal articleenglandj antimicrob chemother. 2007 apr;59(4):786-90. epub 2007 feb 16.",10.1093/jac/dkl562,2/20/07,eng,17307769,yes,allison,yes,nchedo,nchedo,zach_1,yes,zm_1.csv,NA,NA,zm_1_1.mex,yes,journal

Results: The spa-types identified among the 27 TetR MRSA isolates were (no strains): t011 (12), t1197 (1), t3934 (2), t002 (1), t008 (1), t067 (3), t127 (2), t1381 (1), t2220 (2), and 2 new spa-types (t7613, t7577). Fifteen strains (55.6{\%}) were included in spa types related to the livestock-associated sequence type ST398 (t011, t1197 and t3934). These strains and one strain with a new spa-type (t7577) were typed as SCCmecV and agrI. The other strain with a new spa-type (t7613) presented a non-typable SCCmec and agrI. The remaining 10 MRSA strains were typed as SCCmecIV and agrI, agrII or agrIII. The following genes were detected (no strains): ermB (7), ermC (13), ermT (2), msrA/msrB (4), mphC (5), tetK (16), tetM (27), aac(6)aph(2) (5), dfrA (2) and mupA (3). Mutation in quinolone targets were studied in 10 ciprofloxacin resistant ST398 strains and all of them showed S80F amino acid change in GrlA, six also presented S84L, two S84A, one E84G and one no mutation in GyrA. Two strains were PVL positive (t7613 and t008) and 20 strains were cna positive. None of them presented tst, eta, etb and etd genes. Conclusion: More than half of TetR MRSA studied corresponded to spa types associated to the genetic lineage ST398. Tetracycline resistance could be a good initial marker to think about potential ST398, although this resistance can also be detected in other lineages. In addition, PVL positive MRSA were also detected in this collection.",C Lozano and A Rezusta and E GÌ_mez-Sanz and C Colmenarejo and R BÌÁez and D Benito and M Revillo and M Zarazaga and C Torres,1198-743x,Clinical Microbiology and Infection,"amino acid,antibiotic agent,antibiotic resistance,antibiotic sensitivity,ciprofloxacin,gene,hospital,human,livestock,marker,methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus,mutation,patient,quinolone,tetracycline,virulence,virulence factor",s204--s205,{Clonal lineages of tetracycline-resistant MRSA strains isolated in a Spanish hospital during 2009.

While all strains were sensitive to erythromycin (MIC 0.5-4 mg l(-1)), 35 isolates (85.4 {\%}) exhibited resistance to ciprofloxacin (MIC 8-64 mg l(-1)). All resistant strains carried the Thr-86 to Ile mutation in the gyrase A (gyrA) gene, as shown by mismatch amplification mutation assay (MAMA) and confirmed by sequencing. Based on the partial sequences of gyrA, resistant isolates carried 10 distinct alleles, eight of them representing new variants. Strains were assigned to 30 MTs based on the combined results of PFGE and flaA PCR-RFLP typing. Eight of the 35 ciprofloxacin-resistant strains, isolated over a period of more than 1 year, represented the largest MT, also carrying the same allelic variant of the gyrA gene. These results show that the local incidence of fluoroquinolone resistance among C. jejuni is one of the highest reported worldwide. It was also demonstrated that stable MTs could persist for a relatively long time among the clonally unrelated antibiotic-resistant isolates of C. jejuni.

2989,yes,camins2007,article,"BACKGROUND: Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus organisms (VRE) have emerged as common nosocomial pathogens, but few population-based data are available on the impact of invasive VRE infections. METHODS: We assessed the incidence of invasive VRE infections and predictors of mortality among patients identified during prospective, population-based surveillance performed in the metropolitan statistical area (MSA) of Atlanta, Georgia. RESULTS: From July 1997 through June 2000, a total of 192 patients who resided in the Atlanta MSA developed an invasive VRE infection, for a rate of 1.57 cases per 100,000 person-years. The incidence of invasive VRE disease significantly increased from 0.91 cases per 100,000 person-years during the first year of the study to 1.73 cases per 100,000 person-years during the third year of the study (P{\textless}.001). Rates of invasive VRE infection were significantly higher among African American patients than white patients (2.59 vs 0.70 cases per 100,000 person-years; P{\textless}.001). Blood was the most common sterile site from which VRE was recovered (161 [83{\%}] of 193 isolates), followed by deep surgical sites (17 [9{\%}]), peritoneal fluid (10 [5{\%}]), pleural fluid (3 [2{\%}]), and cerebrospinal fluid (1 [0.5{\%}]). In multivariate analysis, a Charlson comorbidity index of 5 or greater, previous receipt of antibiotic therapy, having 2 or more sets of blood cultures positive for VRE, and receipt of central parenteral nutrition were independent predictors of mortality, whereas receipt of an antibiotic with in vitro activity against the VRE isolate was associated with a decreased risk of mortality. Molecular typing revealed 38 different pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns, but the 2 most common pulsed-field gel electrophoresis types were found at 3 Emory University-affiliated hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of invasive VRE infection significantly increased in the Atlanta MSA during the 3-year study period, with significant racial disparities detected. Receipt of an antimicrobial agent with in vitro activity against VRE was associated with a lower mortality rate.

In Thailand, CDI exhibits low recurrence and mortality and its molecular epidemiology is unknown. CDI surveillance was conducted in a tertiary facility (Siriraj Hospital, Bangkok). A total of 53 toxigenic C. difficile strains from Thai patients were analyzed by multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), PCR ribotyping, and pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The mean age of the cohort was 64 years and 62.3{\%} were female; 37.7{\%} of patients were exposed to {\textgreater} two antibiotics prior to a diagnosis of CDI, with beta-lactams the most commonly used drug (56.3{\%}). Metronidazole was used most commonly (77.5{\%}; success rate 83.9{\%}), and non-responders were treated with vancomycin (success rate 100{\%}). None of the isolates carried binary toxin genes. Most isolates (98.2-100{\%}) were susceptible to metronidazole, vancomycin, tigecycline and daptomycin. There were 11 sequence types (STs), 13 ribotypes (RTs) and four PFGE types. Six previously identified STs (ST12, ST13, ST14, ST33, ST41 and ST45) and five novel STs unique to Thailand (ST66, ST67, ST68, ST69 and ST70) were identified. PCR RTs UK 017 (ST45) (45.3{\%}) and UK 014/020 (ST33) (24.5{\%}) were the most common. High concordance was observed between the MLST and ribotyping results (p{\textless}0.001). C. difficile isolates from Thai patients were highly susceptible to standard antimicrobial agents.

The patient was treated for 3 months for skin infection with clarithromycin monotherapy. Since her condition deteriorated, the antibiotic therapy was switched to intravenously administered clindamycin, cloxacillin, and meropenem. Due to further deterioration and isolation of M. chelonae from the blood culture, antimicrobial therapy was changed to azithromycin and amikacin. Drug-test sensitivity was performed, and the isolate was susceptible to clarithromycin only. The patient's deteriorating status prevented orally administered medication with clarithromycin (parenteral formulation is not registered in Croatia). The same antibiotic regime was continued until the isolation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. In addition, extensive calcifications in her brain were found on a computed tomography (CT) scan, which suggested Fahr's syndrome. Despite all measures and supportive care, the patient developed multiorgan failure and eventually died. There has been an increase in the number of infections by rapidly growing mycobacteria, but only a few cases of severe systemic infection with M. chelonae have been described. If the infection is diagnosed early and a patient is treated with appropriate drugs, dissemination can be avoided despite immunosuppression.

DNA sequencing revealed that this integron carries three gene cassettes that confer resistance to antimicrobials, aacA4, bla (OXA-56), and aadA7, and an orf1 encoding a putative transposase. All 13 SPM-producing P. aeruginosa isolates had closely related pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) profiles, designated as clonal group A, suggesting nosocomial spread of the strain. This clonal group was the same as that observed in other SPM-1-producing P. aeruginosa isolates from distinct Brazilian states. The dissemination of this clone throughout Brazil could not be explained by transfer of infected patients and/or sharing of common health-care staff. It is likely that the spread of these strains occurred indirectly via the community.",A P Carvalho and R M Albano and D N {de Oliveira} and D A Cidade and L M Teixeira and A {Marques Ede},"1076-6294 (print)1076-6294",Microb Drug Resist,"Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology,Base Sequence,Brazil/epidemiology,Carbapenems/*pharmacology,Colony Count, Microbial,Disease Outbreaks,Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial/*genetics,Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field,Genes, Bacterial,Hospitals, Teaching,Humans,Integrons,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Molecular Sequence Data,Pseudomonas Infections/epidemiology/*microbiology,Pseudomonas aeruginosa/*drug effects/enzymology/is,beta-Lactamases/*genetics",103--108,"{Characterization of an epidemic carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa producing SPM-1 metallo-beta-lactamase in a hospital located in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil}",NA,12,2006,2,"carvalho, ana paula d'alincourtalbano, rodolpho mattosde oliveira, denise nevescidade, daniela anhel de paulateixeira, lucia martinsmarques, elizabeth de andradejournal articleresearch support, non-u.s. gov'tunited statesmicrob drug resist. 2006 summer;12(2):103-8.",10.1089/mdr.2006.12.103,8/23/06,eng,16922625,maybe,brooke,no,erica,allison,zach_1,yes,zm_1.csv,NA,NA,zm_1_1.mex,yes,journal
496,yes,alexander2011,article,"OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively review trends in clindamycin resistance among Staphylococcus aureus head and neck abscesses between January 2000 and June 2008. METHODS: Between January 2000 and June 2008, inpatient and outpatient S aureus isolates were reviewed for antibiotic susceptibility. In particular, cultures from 153 abscesses in the head and neck region were assessed for clindamycin and methicillin resistance patterns. RESULTS: Annual clindamycin resistance rates for all S aureus isolates, and specifically for S aureus head and neck abscesses, revealed concerning levels of clindamycin and methicillin resistance. After 2002, the mean clindamycin resistance rate in head and neck abscesses was approximately 27{\%}. The number of new cases of methicillinresistant S aureus per year increased from four cases in 2000 to 44 cases in 2007. CONCLUSION: Antibiotic resistance should be considered following failed empirical therapy of head and neck abscesses with clindamycin. {\textcopyright}2011 Pulsus Group Inc.

9937,maybe,kaase2011,article,"Objectives: To analyse the mechanisms responsible for carbapenem resistance in one Acinetobacter baumannii isolate recovered from a patient transferred to Germany from an Egyptian hospital. Methods: PCR and sequencing were used to search for $\beta$-lactamase and 16S RNA methylase genes. Multilocus sequence typing was used to determine the sequence type (ST) of the isolate. Results: Sequencing of the PCR product obtained using primers for blaNDM-1 revealed a variant of NDM-1 that had a C to G substitution at position 82 resulting in an amino acid substitution of proline to alanine at position 28. This variant was designated NDM-2. Genes encoding extended-spectrum $\beta$-lactamases or 16S RNA methylase were not detected. The strain lacked detectable plasmids and blaNDM-2 was not transferred by conjugation. MLST showed that the isolate belonged to a new ST, ST103. Conclusions: This work further underlines the spread of NDM carbapenemases in A. baumannii, and the spread of the corresponding gene in the Middle East. It also describes the first variant of NDM-1. {\textcopyright} The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy.

Observation A masculin infant was born at full term pregnancy to a healthy mother by cesarian section because of rupture of membranes and acute fetal distress. He was normal within 48 h of life and C reactive protein (CRP) was negative, so he was discharged from the hospital. He presented at the age of 3 days erythematous pultaceous lesions of the face without fever. He was hospitalised at the age of 5 days. On examination, we noted on his face, neck and back multiple shallow erosions and flaccid pus-filled bullae, varying in size. Investigations including complete hemogram, renal function tests and CRP had results within normal limits. A smear from a pustular lesion and blood culture were done. The infant was started on intravenous oxacillin (100 mg/kg/day) and gentamicin (5 mg/kg/day). The culture of the two samples was positive for MRSA which was resistant to kanamycin and fusidic acid. Antibiotic therapy was modified by vancomycin and pristinamycin for total treatment duration of 14 days. The outcome was favourable with rapid regression of skin lesion. Search by PCR of the mecA gene and the gene encoding Panton-Valentine Leukocidine was positive for the 2 strains of MRSA isolated from blood culture and pustule.

The objective was analyze clinical, epidemiological, microbiological and outcome features of neonates with CA-Sa infection Methods {\&} Materials: Prospective observational study. We included previously healthy patients (p) ä_ 30 days of age admitted in the neonatal unit with CA-Sa infection from 2006 to 2014. We defined CA-Sa infection based on CDC guidelines. Results: We included 37 healthy neonates with CA-Sa infection. Twenty nine (78{\%}) were born by vaginal labor. Mean gestational age was 39 weeks (r: 35-41), weight 3279 grams (r: 2500-4450). Patients had less than 3 birth hospital days in 95{\%} of cases. Contact with parental soft tissue infections were present in 38{\%}, 65{\%} of them were associated with maternal forunculosis. Nineteen p (51{\%}) were female. Mean age at admission was 18 days (r: 4-30). Thirty four p (92{\%}) had skin and soft tissue involved at admission, with celulitis, bullous impetigo, pustulosis, chest, facial/neck, inguinal and goin abscesses and mastitis. Fifteen p (40{\%}) also had invasive disease: sepsis, omphalitis, osteoarthritis, orbital cellulitis, cerebral abscess, meningitis, liver abscess and necrotizing pneumonia. Only 3p with invasive disease (osteoarthritis: 1p, otitis:1p and pleuropulmonar infection: 1p) didn't have skin and soft tissue manifestation at admission. Positive culture was obtained in 33p (89{\%}) from purulent effusion, and 4 (11{\%}) from blood culture alone. Between 37 CA-Sa infections, 27 (72{\%}) were MRSA and 11{\%} were clindamycin resistant too. All patients were treated with antibiotics and in 24p (65{\%}) surgical drainage was performed. Thirty four p (92{\%}) received sequential parenteral -oral treatment with a mean duration of 21 days (r: 1-60d). Median hospital stay was 12 days (r: 4-60). One patient (2, 7{\%}) died because of sepsis and necrotizing pneumonia.

2144,maybe,billstrom2010,article,"AIMS: To screen for the globally spread cluster of Enterococcus faecium, clonal complex 17 (CC17) and characterize the genetic profile of Swedish clinical Ent. faecium isolates. METHODS: A total of 203 consecutive isolates collected from 2004 to 2007 from patients with bacteraemia in Sweden. All isolates were genotyped using multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) and 20 isolates representing different MLVA types (MT) were chosen for multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Minimal inhibitory concentrations against clinically relevant antibiotics were determined with agar dilution. Presence of the virulence genes esp and hyl was investigated using PCR. RESULTS: A total of 65{\%} (n = 109) of all isolates belonged to MT-1, and the second most common MLVA type was MT-159 (13{\%}, n = 21). MLST analysis confirmed the presence of CC17 during the entire study period. The number of isolates resistant to gentamicin and vancomycin, as well as the presence of hyl, increased significantly during the investigation period. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that nosocomial infections caused by Ent. faecium CC17 are commonly occurring in Sweden.

2419,maybe,borgia2012a,article,"Background.New Delhi metallo-{\ss}-lactamase (NDM) has emerged worldwide in clinically relevant gram-negative bacteria. We report an outbreak of NDM-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae in patients with no prior travel history to endemic regions.Methods.Five NDM-1-producing K. pneumoniae colonizing and/or clinically infecting patients in a community tertiary hospital were detected between October and November 2011. NDM-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae (K. pneumoniae and Escherichia coli) were clinically and epidemiologically characterized, including susceptibility profiles, molecular typing, and molecular characterization of plasmids and resistant determinants.Results.Five patients were identified carrying NDM-1-producing K. pneumoniae, all of them epidemiologically linked with each other. K. pneumoniae were confirmed to belong to the same clone, exhibiting multidrug-resistant phenotypes. One patient was positive for NDM-1-producing E. coli in blood and E. coli and K. pneumoniae in rectal specimens, both containing the same blaNDM plasmid, suggesting horizontal transfer between species in the patient. No environmental sources of these strains were found. Detection of positive isolates directly from rectal specimens allowed the rapid identification and isolation of colonized patients.Conclusions.We report a NDM-1-producing K. pneumoniae outbreak in Ontario, Canada.

The resistance in 828 untreated adults, 124 treated adults and 105 untreated children was, respectively, 26.5, 50.8 and 16.2{\%} for metronidazole; 18.4, 45.2 and 19{\%} for clarithromycin; 1, 2.4 and 0{\%} for amoxicillin; 4.4, 10.6 and 1.9{\%} for tetracycline; and 9, 14.5 and 5.8{\%} for ciprofloxacin. Triple resistance to the evaluated agents was uncommon and was detected in 1{\%} of the untreated children, 3.5{\%} of the untreated adults and 13.6{\%} of the treated adults. Five H. pylori strains were resistant to amoxicillin, metronidazole and clarithromycin, two of them exhibiting quadruple resistance. Resistance to four of the five antibacterials tested was found in 0.7{\%} of the untreated and 1.8{\%} of the treated adults. The overall level of multidrug resistance in the treated adults (15.4{\%}) was higher than that in the untreated adults (4.2{\%}, P=0.0001) and the untreated children (1{\%}, P=0.0001). The presence of multidrug H. pylori resistance in Bulgaria could be associated with many factors, among them the slightly increasing national use of macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramins and of quinolones since 2000, the significant increase in primary H. pylori clarithromycin resistance, the high tetracycline use between 1994 and 1999, and, in individual cases, the use of azithromycin-based regimens or reuse of nitroimidazoles. In conclusion, for the first time in a European country during the last 5 years, H. pylori strains harbouring a worrying quadruple antibacterial resistance were found in treated as well as in untreated patients.

A subset of 138 suspected extended-spectrum cephalosporinase (ESC) producers were examined for genes encoding cephalosporin resistance. Forty-three isolates harboring bla(CTX-M-14) or bla(CTX-M-15) were analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and plasmids containing these genes were typed using PCR-based replicon typing (PBRT). Thirteen phylogroup B2 bla(CTX-M-14)- and bla(CTX-M-15)-positive isolates were analyzed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). A frequent occurrence of resistance ({\textgreater}46{\%}) was observed toward cephalosporins, gentamicin, and fluoroquinolones. Among the 222 isolates, 4 qnrS1, 4 qepA, and 16 aac(6')-Ib-cr genes were confirmed. Four major phylogroups (A, B1, B2, and D) and nontypeable isolates (NTs) were found among the isolates, with phylogroup D (54{\%}) being the most common phylogroup. A total of 110 (80{\%}) of the 138 screened isolates harbored bla(CTX-M) genes, with bla(CTX-M-14) (71{\%}) and bla(CTX-M-15) (24{\%}) being the most prevalent of these genes. Nine of the 13 CTX-M-15- or CTX-M-14-containing B2 isolates belonged to ST131.

Here we report a case of successfully treated multiple liver abscess due to CRKP in a liver transplanted patient. Case report A 65-year-old Caucasian woman underwent liver transplant. The patient had no significant medical background except for chronic renal failure; pretransplant cultures resulted negative for MDR bacteria. The postoperative course (p.o.) was characterized by biliary anastomotic-fistula which required an hepaticojejunostomy. During the p.o. course an ESBL-producing E. Aerogenes and K. Pneumoniae resistant to all the antibiotics tested (apart for intermediate sensitivity to gentamycin and tygecicline) were isolated from throat swabs. The patient despite being colonized by CRKP was doing well and discharged. Two months later, she was readmitted for the abrupt onset of fever. A CT scan revealed the presence of multiple abscesses in the liver graft (max diameter 3.5 cm). Teicoplanin, anidulafungin and a weaning of the immunosuppressive therapy were the initial empiric therapy. Blood cultures resulted positive for both E. coli and Klebsiella Pneumoniae, confirming the previous isolated colonizating microorganisms. Fluid samples from the percutaneous drain in the liver abscesses tested positive for the same CRKP strain. The treatment strategy consisted of prolonged antimicrobial combination (meropenem, tygecycline and gentamicin) and drainage of the abscesses As long-time therapy and to preserve renal function, the antimicrobial therapy was then switched to ertapenem and tigecycline. On p.o. day 88, a PET-CT revealed a good response with substantial recovery and only residual activity; the therapy for CRKP was stopped and the patient discharged in good clinical condition. At the moment the patient is doing well with complete recovery of the liver lesions.

6995,maybe,garland2011,article,"Intrapartum chemoprophylaxis for pregnant group B streptococcus (GBS) carriers reduces vertical transmission, with a resultant decrease in neonatal as well as maternal morbidity from invasive GBS infection. Current Australian guidelines recommend penicillin for intrapartum prophylaxis of GBS carriers, with erythromycin or clindamycin for those with a beta-lactam allergy. Recent reports globally suggest that resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin may be increasing; hence, a study was undertaken to promote an evidence base for local clinical guidelines. Samples collected for standardized susceptibility testing included 1160 invasive GBS isolates (264 isolates retrospectively from 1982 to 2001 and prospectively from 2002 to 2006, plus 896 prospectively collected colonizing GBS isolates gathered over a 12 month period from 2005 to 2006) from 16 laboratories around Australia. All isolates displaying phenotypic macrolide or lincosamide resistance were subsequently genotyped. No isolates showed reduced susceptibility to penicillin or vancomycin. Of the invasive isolates, 6.4 {\%} demonstrated phenotypic erythromycin resistance and 4.2 {\%} were clindamycin resistant. Of the erythromycin-resistant isolates, 53 {\%} showed cross-resistance to clindamycin. Very similar results were found in colonizing specimens. There was no statistically significant change in macrolide-resistance rates over the two study periods 1982-2001 and 2002-2006. Genotyping for macrolide and lincosamide-resistant isolates was largely consistent with phenotype. These findings suggest that penicillin therapy remains an appropriate first-line antibiotic choice for intrapartum GBS chemoprophylaxis, with erythromycin and/or clindamycin resistance being low in the Australian population. It would, nevertheless, be appropriate for laboratories screening for GBS in obstetric patients to consider macrolide sensitivity testing, particularly for those with beta-lactam allergy, to ensure appropriate chemoprophylaxis.",S M Garland and E Cottrill and L Markowski and C Pearce and V Clifford and D Ndisang and N Kelly and A J Daley,0022-2615,J Med Microbiol,"*Drug Resistance, Bacterial,Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology,Australia,Female,Genes, Bacterial,Humans,Infant, Newborn,Pregnancy,Streptococcal Infections/*microbiology,Streptococcus agalactiae/*drug effects/*isolation",230--235,{Antimicrobial resistance in group B streptococcus: the Australian experience},NA,60,2011,pt 2,"1473-5644garland, suzanne mcottrill, erinmarkowski, lisapearce, chrisclifford, vanessandisang, danielkelly, nigeldaley, andrew jaustralasian group for antimicrobial resistance-gbs resistance study groupjournal articleenglandj med microbiol. 2011 feb;60(pt 2):230-5. doi: 10.1099/jmm.0.022616-0. epub 2010 oct 28.",10.1099/jmm.0.022616-0,10/30/10,eng,21030500,maybe,cale,no,allison,zach,zach_2,yes,zm_2.csv,NA,NA,zm_2_1.mex,yes,journal

7585,yes,gottig2013,article,"OBJECTIVES: This study characterized a new variant of the New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM). METHODS: A multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli isolate was recovered from the wounds, throat and rectum of a Yemeni patient who presented at the Frankfurt University Hospital in Germany. The presence of beta-lactamase genes was analysed by PCR and sequencing. The isolate was further characterized by susceptibility testing, conjugation and transformation assays and plasmid analysis. RESULTS: The E. coli isolate was resistant to all beta-lactams including carbapenems. By PCR analysis, the beta-lactamase genes blaCMY-2, blaCTX-M-15, blaTEM-1 and blaNDM were identified. Sequencing revealed a blaNDM gene that differed from blaNDM-1 by two point mutations at positions 388 (G--{\textgreater}A) and 460 (A--{\textgreater}C) corresponding to amino acid substitutions Asp130Asn and Met154Leu, respectively. This NDM variant was identified as NDM-7. The blaNDM-7 gene was located on a self-transferable IncX3 plasmid of 60 kb. E. coli TOP10 transformants harbouring NDM-7 showed higher MICs of beta-lactams including carbapenems compared with transformants harbouring NDM-1. Multilocus sequence typing analysis revealed that the E. coli isolate belonged to a novel sequence type (ST599). CONCLUSIONS: This study identified a novel NDM variant in E. coli, NDM-7, possessing a high ability to hydrolyse beta-lactam antibiotics. Given the diversity of NDM variants located on self-transferable plasmids found in different Gram-negative species and isolated in different countries, the blaNDM gene will most likely efficiently disseminate worldwide.",S Gottig and A G Hamprecht and S Christ and V A Kempf and T A Wichelhaus,0305-7453,J Antimicrob Chemother,"Bacterial Proteins/*genetics/*secretion,Conjugation, Genetic,DNA, Bacterial/genetics,Enterobacteriaceae,Escherichia coli Infections/*microbiology,Escherichia coli/*drug effects/*enzymology/genetic,Genotype,Germany,Humans,IncX3,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Multilocus Sequence Typing,Ndm-1,Pharynx/microbiology,Plasmids,Polymerase Chain Reaction,Rectum/microbiology,Transformation, Bacterial,Wounds and Injuries/microbiology,antibiotic resistance,beta-Lactamases/*genetics/*secretion,carbapenems",1737--1740,"{Detection of NDM-7 in Germany, a new variant of the New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase with increased carbapenemase activity}",NA,68,2013,8,"1460-2091gottig, stephanhamprecht, axel gchrist, sarakempf, volkhard a jwichelhaus, thomas ajournal articleresearch support, non-u.s. gov'tenglandj antimicrob chemother. 2013 aug;68(8):1737-40. doi: 10.1093/jac/dkt088. epub 2013 apr 3.",10.1093/jac/dkt088,4/6/13,eng,23557929,yes,jake,yes,erica,erica,zach_2,yes,zm_2.csv,NA,NA,zm_2_1.mex,yes,journal

The incidence of community-acquired infection due to such bacteria is increasing, but few cases of infant upper urinary tract infection (UUTI) have been reported in Japan. We treated four infants with UUTI caused by ESBL-producing Escherichia coli, as determined by genotyping. Using medical records, we retrospectively evaluated the clinical course, antibiotic use and efficacy, antimicrobial susceptibility results, and the presence of underlying disease. One of the four had been previously hospitalized for occult bacteremia. Two developed UUTI after antibiotic treatment, indicating that previous antibiotic use may have been a risk factor in these cases. We could not identify the infection route in all cases. Two of the four had bilateral vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Renal scintigraphy was done in three. Although an initial dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) defect was detected in all four, only one had renal scarring. E. coli isolates from all four showed PCR signals for blaCTX-M-; one isolate positive for the blaCTX-M3 group and three positive for blaCTX-M14. Antimicrobial susceptibility test results showed all isolates to be resistant to cephalosporins, but discrepancies existed between antimicrobial susceptibility results and actual clinical efficacy. Clinically, cefazolin (CEZ) was effective in two subjects and ceftazidime (CAZ) effective in one. Panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP) was effective in one. None of the four developed sepsis or meningitis.

8670,maybe,hirsch2010a,article,"Bacteria producing Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases (KPCs) are rapidly emerging as a cause of multidrug-resistant infections worldwide. Bacterial isolates harbouring these enzymes are capable of hydrolysing a broad spectrum of beta-lactams including the penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems and monobactam. Detection of isolates harbouring carbapenemases can be inconsistent using automated systems, often requiring subsequent confirmatory tests. Phenotypic methods utilizing boronic acid disc tests have demonstrated promising results and appear practical for use in clinical microbiology laboratories. Treatment of infection caused by KPC bacteria is particularly worrisome as the carbapenems are often agents of the last resort for resistant Gram-negative infections. The optimal treatment of infections caused by KPC bacteria is not well established and clinical outcome data remain sparse. We reviewed the current literature regarding clinical outcomes following KPC infections, with a specific effort to summarize the clinical data available for specific antimicrobial agents. A total of 15 papers involving 55 unique patient cases were reviewed. While the total number of patients is relatively small, some useful insights could still be gathered to guide clinicians in the management of KPC infections. Tigecycline and the aminoglycosides were associated with positive outcomes in the majority of cases. Clinical success rates were low when the polymyxins were used as monotherapy, but were much higher when they were used in combination.

A total of 39 carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates collected from patients receiving care at 5 teaching hospitals in Jiangxi province, central China, were analyzed for carriage of resistance genes, including blaNDM-1. Two carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates (NC12 and NC18) were found to harbor blaNDM-1. In addition to blaNDM-1, NC12 also carried blaSHV-1, while NC18 harbored additional resistance genes, including blaSHV-12, blaCTX-M-14, armA and blaTEM-1. NC12 and NC18 belonged to ST15 and novel ST1031 and were clonally unrelated. Carbapenem resistance for NC12 could be transferred to Escherichia coli recipients through conjugation and chemical transformation, while carbapenem resistance for NC18 was only transferred to E. coli recipients by chemical transformation. The EcoR1-digested DNA pattern of plasmids from the transformants of NC12 was identical to that for NC18. Taken together, this is the first report of blaNDM-1 carriage by K. pneumoniae clinical isolates in mainland China, indicating that blaNDM-1 is disseminated among Enterobacteriaceae in China.

9049,maybe,huang2015c,article,"BACKGROUND: Carbapenem resistance among the Enterobacteriaceae is a serious healthcare challenge. bla IMI is a carbapenemase gene mediating resistance to carbapenems but has not been commonly found. A bla IMI-carrying Enterobacter cloacae, which was also resistant to colistin, is reported here. FINDINGS: E. cloacae strain WCHECl-1060 was recovered from a blood sample of a leukemia patient, who was not previously exposed to colistin. Strain WCHECl-1060 belongs to a new sequence type, ST410, and was resistant to carbapenems and colistin but was susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins. A new allelic variant of bla IMI-1, which has two silent mutations compared to the original bla IMI-1 variant, was found in strain WCHECl-1060. Conjugation and transformation experiments failed to transfer bla IMI-1, suggesting a likely chromosome origin. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first report of an IMI-1 carbapenemase-producing colistin-resistant E. cloacae in China. Microbiological laboratories should be aware of the unusual carbapenem-resistant but third-generation cephalosporin-susceptible profiles of these IMI-producing isolates.

Although they are mostly plant pathogens, R. radiobacter may cause human infections. The aim of this report was to present a case of R. radiobacter bacteremia treated with levofloxacin. Twenty-seven year old male patient had fever after receiving chemotherapy due to osteosarcoma. The infection focus could not be detected in the initial physical examination. Blood cultures were obtained from peripheral veins and central catheter and levofloxacin (500 mg/day) was started as empirical therapy. His fever resolved on the next day. Meanwhile cultures of blood (Bact/Alert automated systems, bioMerieux, Durham, NC) obtained from peripheral veins and central catheters yielded bacteria which were identified as R. radiobacter by VITEK 2 (bioMerieux Inc, Mercy L'etoil, France). The strain was resistant to amikacin and sensitive to ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, meropenem and piperacillin/tazobactam. The patient was diagnosed as catheter-related bacteremia and the treatment was continued for 14 days. His catheter was not removed since subsequent cultures did not reveal any bacterial growth. In conclusion this case suggests that R. radiobacter may cause infections especially in immunocompromised patients with catheters or prosthetic devices.

Materials and methods: During 2013-2014 we have isolated 15 cases of Salmonella enterica serotype Virchow from stool samples of patients admitted in Maharishi Valmiki Infectious Diseases Hospital (MVIDH), Kingsway Camp, Delhi, India. Rectal swab samples were processed as per WHO guidelines (CDC/WHO/ USAID, 2003). Antibiotic sensitivity test and MIC Antimicrobial sensitivity and MIC of all 15 Salmonella enterica serotype Virchow isolates were carried out by Kirby-Bauer ((Bauer et al., 1966; CLSI, 2013) disk diffusion method using commercially available antibiotic disks and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was carried out by agar dilution method as per CLSI guidelines 2013(CLSI, 2013). Results: Conformation of isolates. All 15 Salmonella enterica serotype Virchow was serologically confirmed Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Virchow (6,7,r:1,2) according to White-Kauffmann-Le Minor scheme. Antibiotic sensitivity assay All Salmonella enterica serotype Virchow were 100{\%} resistant to amikacin, gentamicin, nalidixic acid followed by cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin and 100{\%} sensitive to ampicillin, norfloxacin, ceftriaxone, chloramphenicol, and imipenem. The MIC of gentamicin resistant isolates having MIC of ä´512 $\mu$g/ml. Conclusion: In 2013 we have only got two Salmonella enterica serotype Virchow but in 2014 suddenly it emerged in Delhi NCR and all are gentamicin and amikacin resistant. The same clone emerged in both humans and poultry, indicating that poultry was probably the main source for Salmonella serovar Virchow in the food chain. Heightened awareness and coordinated approach by national and international health, food, and agriculture authorities is necessary to implement measures to monitor and limit spread of this strain.

Methods: The tissue samples were collected by gastroscope biopsy from the outpatients and inpatients with gastric diseases from 2010 to 2012. 320 tissue samples cultured in microaerobic condition were identified as typical H. pylori strains by biochemical and slice checking methods. E-test method was used to measure the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of these identified H. pylori strains resistant to metronidazole, clarithromycin, tetracycline, Levofloxacin and amoxicillin. Drug sensitivity tests of furazolidone was performed by means of Kirby-Bane. Results: Among 320 H. pylori strains, the resistance rate to metronidazole was 71.25{\%}(228/320), and the MIC ranged from 0.016 mg/L to beyond 256 mg/L; to tetracycline, 5.31{\%}(17/320),MIC ranged from 0.016 mg/L to 32 mg/L;to clarithromycin, 16.88{\%}(54/320),MIC ranged from 0.016 mg/L to beyond 256 mg/L; to Levofloxacin, 14.38{\%}(46/320), MIC from 0.02 mg/L to beyond 256 mg/L; amoxicillin 1.25{\%}(4/320), MIC from 0.016 mg/L to 2 mg/L; furazolidone 0{\%}(0/320).

Materials and Methods: A multi resistant Morganella morganii SM12012 isolate was recovered from pus from a patient hospitalized in the intensive care unit at the Military hospital, Tunisia. Antibiotic susceptibility was tested with the agar disk diffusion method according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. ESBLs were detected using a standard double-disk synergy test. The characterization of beta-lactamases and associated resistance genes were performed by isoelectric focusing, polymerase chain reaction and nucleotide sequencing. Results: The antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed the high resistance to penicillins, cephalosporins (MICs: 64-512 $\mu$g/ml) and fluoroquinolones (MICs: 32-512 $\mu$g/ml). But M. morganii SM12012 isolate remained susceptible to carbapenems (MICs: 4-{\textless}0.25 $\mu$g/ml). The double-disk synergy test confirmed the phenotype of extended-spectrum $\beta$-lactamases (ESBLs). Three identical $\beta$-lactamases with pI values of 6.5, 7.8 and superior to 8.6 were detected after isoelectric focusing analysis. These $\beta$-lactamases genes can be successfully transferred by the conjugative plasmid. Molecular analysis demonstrated the co-production of bla DHA-1, bla CTX-M-15 and qnrS1 genes on the same plasmid. The detection of an associated chromosomal quinolone resistance revealed the presence of a parC mutation at codon 80 (Ser80-lle80). Conclusion: This is the first report in Tunisia of nosocomial infection due to the production of CTX-M-15 and DHA-1 $\beta$-lactamases in M. morganii isolate with the association of quinolone plasmid resistance.

Methods: Eight intensive care unit (ICU) patients infected/colonized by extended-spectrum $\beta$-lactamase (ESBL)-producing P. stuartii between March and May 2011 were included. Molecular epidemiology was studied by PFGE. Antibiotic resistance genes were analysed by PCR and sequencing and the plasmid incompatibility group by a PCR-based replicon typing scheme. Results: Eight patients were colonized with ESBL-producing P. stuartii isolates. All these isolates were clonally related and found to carry blaOXA-48, blaPER-1, blaCMY-4, qnrA6 and aac-6Û_-Ib genes on the same self-conjugative IncA/C plasmid. The same strain was also cultured from environmental samples in the ICU. All these isolates were susceptible to carbapenems. Only one colonized patient developed P. stuartii pleurisy and was effectively treated with imipenem alone. Conclusions: This is the first report of an outbreak due to P. stuartii isolates carrying blaOXA-48 in Tunisia. The simultaneous expression of various resistance genes (blaOXA-48, blaCMY-4, blaPER-1, qnrA and aac-6Û_-Ib) by P. stuartii isolates is alarming. {\textcopyright} The Author 2012.

14299,yes,moodley2015,article,"Multidrug resistant organisms such as vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) are an increasing threat to healthcare worldwide. This organism has been detected worldwide in adult and paediatric patients since the first description in 1986, with the first laboratory detection in South Africa in 1993. VRE were isolated, identified and their antimicrobial susceptibility profiles determined using the Vitek 2 system, from February-November 2013. Vancomycin MIC's were determined using the Etest method. Isolates were screened for the vanA/B/C genes with conventional PCR. Positive isolates were compared using pulsedfield gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Two patients with blood stream infections (BSI) cultured VRE, two days apart, in February 2013, at Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital. This was the first incidence of VRE at this facility and indicated the possibility of an outbreak. Active surveillance and heightened infection control were instituted to limit spread. 29 patients were subsequently screened for colonization with VRE, of which 2 were positive. In September and November 2013, 2 additional VRE were obtained from two patients with BSI's. Screening Results of 26 patients revealed 6 colonized patients. PCR Results indicated that all the VRE isolated possessed the vanA gene, which confers high-level resistance to glycopepetides. PFGE Results indicated a high level of genetic diversity between all the isolates. The initial 2 isolates shared high levels of genetic relatedness (92.5{\%}), indicating likely patient-to-patient transmission of the same clone. A second isolate from patient 2 shared 97.9{\%} homology with the isolate from patient 3. Two isolates from patient 4 had low homology with each other (61.1{\%}) and very low homology with other strains tested. Five of the screening isolates shared high levels of relatedness (?90{\%}) indicating possible spread during the outbreak. An outbreak of VRE in a paediatric hospital was detected.

We performed a study to identify the resistance phenotypes to beta-lactam antibiotics of the Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae strains involved in infectious pathology. Methods. We performed a retrospective study of the strains isolated from patients hospitalized in the Clinical Hospital of Infectious and Tropical Diseases ÛÏDr. Victor BabeÙ.Û between January and September 2012. Antibioresistance phenotypes were identified through the standard diffusion method and the confirmation and determination of MIC values were made with the VITEK2C and E-test, according to CLSI 2011-2012. The ÛÏChampagne corkÛ synergism test induced by clavulanic acid was performed through the DDD method (Double Disc Diffusion), for the screening of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL)-producing strains. The resistance to beta-lactams (first thru third generation cephalosporins, monobactams, cephamycins; with the exception of fourth generation cephalosporins and carbapenems) produced by beta-lactamase AmpC were identified through screening of resistance to cefoxitin (30 Hg/disc), VITEK2C (MIC cefoxitin {\textgreater}8 ng/mL) and confirmed through the E-test method (AmpC-strip: cefotetan/ cefotetan plus cloxacillin CN/CNI). The modified Hodge-test was used for confirmation of resistance strains to carbapenems (MEM 30ug/disc, CMI ETP {\textgreater}8 ng/mL). Internal quality control: E coli ATCC 25923. Results. 320 Klebsiella pneumoniae and 57 Enterobacter cloacae strains were studied; 47.8{\%} were ESBL-positive K pneumoniae strains. Out of the 320 ESBL-positive Kpneumoniae isolates, 49 were resistant to cefoxitin: 0.6{\%} produced plasmid AmpC cephalosporinase (CN/CNI{\textgreater}8, E-test) and 14.7{\%} were resistant to cephamycins by impermeability mechanisms. 5{\%} of K pneumoniae strains presented ESBL-positive/CTX-M-like (cefotaximase). For 22/320 (6.8{\%}) K pneumoniae with MIC for ertapenem (ETP) {\textgreater}8ug/mL (resistant to imipenem/IPM, meropenem/MEM), the modified Hodge test and the screening IP/IPI (E-test) were performed: 5.6{\%}/ non-carbapenemases producing strains (porin loss and impermeability mechanisms); 0.6{\%} MBL-positive K pneumoniae; 0.6{\%} KPC-positive. 19.3{\%} of Enterobacter cloacae strains were ESBL-positive; 5.2{\%} ESBL-negative isolates were plasmid AmpC cephalosporinase-producing strains; 7.0{\%} metallo-beta-lactamases /MBL)-positive isolates. Conclusion. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae represent a continuous challenge in identification of the resistance mechanisms to beta-lactams; these strains are usually multidrug resistant and for this reason the therapeutical options are very limited.

The aim of this study was to analyze carbapenem-resistant isolates of Enterobacter cloacae that have emerged for the first time in the intensive care unit (ICU) at the University Hospital Centre Split, Croatia. The strains were selected in the period between June and August 2012, according to their susceptibility patterns to carbapenems. Resistant isolates were screened for metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) production with the use of the imipenem-EDTA disk synergy test, and positive findings were confirmed by PCR. The type of VIM beta-lactamase gene was determined by sequencing of PCR products. The genetic relatedness was evaluated using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis. The demographic and clinical data were retrospectively analyzed from medical records. Five patients were infected and one patient was colonized with a single clone of multidrug-resistant VIM-1-producing E. cloacae susceptible only to colistin. Three cases of lower respiratory tract infections, one case of bacteremia, and one case of intra-abdominal infection were identified. All cases were hospital-acquired after prolonged stay in ICU. All patients had serious underlying diseases and received a broad-spectrum antibiotic. Four patients died and two had unimprovable medical condition at the time of discharge from the hospital.

In Thailand, carbapenemase-producing CRE isolates have been reported increasingly, whereas information of other resistance mechanisms is limited. Therefore, we characterized carbapenemase-negative ertapenem-resistant Escherichia coli (CNEREc) isolates collected between 2010 and 2014 from a Thai university hospital. Methods: Eight non-repetitive CNEREc isolates with ertapenem MICs of {\textgreater}1 $\mu$g/ml were detected for extended-spectrum $\beta$-lactamase (ESBL) and AmpC $\beta$-lactamase (AmpC) production by phenotypic tests and PCR methods. The ompC and ompF were detected by PCR and nucleotide sequencing. Clonal relatedness was performed by ERIC-PCR. Results: The ertapenem, imipenem and meropenem MIC ranges for the 8 isolates were 2-32, 0.125-8 and 0.125-4 $\mu$g/mL, respectively. Seven isolates produced CTX-M type ESBLs, whereas no AmpC was found. All isolates exhibited the ompF and two isolates did not contain the ompC.

There have been numerous reports of the emergence of colistin resistance in patients, most of whom had previously received colistin therapy or with acquisition via nosocomial transmission. However, there are also ample reports of colistin resistance in humans who have not received the drug previously or without nosocomial transmission. We have also observed a similar occurrence in our study involving colistin resistance from several countries along with a similar phenomenon being reported by researchers. The observation of colistin resistance in humans without prior colistin exposure is of particularly great clinical importance and concern because of the current importance of colistin in clinical medicine. Colistin use and colistin-resistant bacteria in animals have been recently reported, suggesting that animals could also be a source of transmission of colistin-resistant bacteria to humans.

16150,yes,pathak2012a,article,"Background: Recent reports of the rapid evolution of bacterial resistance in India require urgent antibiotic stewardship programs. This study aimed to define the magnitude and pattern of resistance of bacterial pathogens to guide empirical therapy. Methods: We prospectively collected consecutive, clinically significant, and nonduplicate bacterial isolates from each patient from two hospitals in Ujjain, India. The antibiotic susceptibility of the bacteria was tested using a disc diffusion method as recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. Results: A total of 716 pathogens were isolated from 2568 patients (median age, 25 years; range, 0 days to 92 years). Gram-negative infections were predominant (62{\%}). The isolated pathogens included Staphylococcus aureus (n = 221; 31{\%}), Escherichia coli (n = 149; 21{\%}), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 127; 18{\%}), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 107; 15{\%}). Common diagnoses included abscesses (56{\%}), urinary tract infections (14{\%}), blood stream infections (10{\%}), pneumonia (10{\%}), and vaginal infections (10{\%}). In E. coli isolates, 69{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 61.6-76.6) were extended-spectrum $\beta$-lactamase (ESBL) producers and 41{\%} (95{\%} CI 31.6-50.5) of K. pneumoniae isolates were ESBL producers. These isolates had a high resistance to fluoroquinolones and $\beta$-lactams, except for imipenem and piperacillin-tazobactam. Salmonella typhi remained sensitive to third-generation cephalosporins. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) constituted 30{\%} of all S. aureus isolates and showed resistance to ciprofloxacin (81{\%}), cotrimoxazole (76{\%}), and levofloxacin (60{\%}). Conclusion: Our results showed a high prevalence of ESBL among Gram-negative bacterial isolates and a high prevalence of MRSA among S. aureus isolates. Carbapenems provided the broadest coverage for Gram-negative bacteria, while glycopeptides were the most effective against MRSA; however, both classes of drugs need to be used judiciously. This study will help in planning future antibiotic stewardship programs. {\textcopyright} 2012 Pathak et al, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.",A Pathak and Y Marothi and V Kekre and K Mahadik and R Macaden and C S Lundborg,1178-6973,Infection and Drug Resistance,"Escherichia coli,India,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Pseudomonas aeruginosa,Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi,Staphylococcus aureus,adult,aged,antibiotic resistance,article,bacterial pneumonia,bacterial virulence,bacterium isolation,beta lactam,bloodstream infection,carbapenem,cephalosporin,ciprofloxacin,controlled study,cotrimoxazole,disease surveillance,disk diffusion,extended spectrum beta lactamase,extended spectrum beta lactamase producing Enterob,female,human,infant,levofloxacin,major clinical study,male,methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus,microbial sensitivity test,nonhuman,prevalence,prospective study,quinoline derived antiinfective agent,urinary tract infection,vaginitis",65--73,"{High prevalence of extended-spectrum $\beta$-lactamase-producing pathogens: Results of a surveillance study in two hospitals in Ujjain, India}",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l364869568 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=11786973{\&}id=doi:{\&}atitle=high+prevalence+of+extended-spectrum+$\beta$-lactamase-producing+pathogens{\%}3a+results+of+a+,5,2012,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,maybe,melanie,yes,nchedo,nchedo,zach_2,yes,zm_2.csv,NA,NA,zm_2_1.mex,yes,journal

Both cases presented as infection in community-dwelling individuals in Australia and were associated with travel to the Indian Subcontinent. One isolate of Escherichia coli harbored the previously undescribed enzyme variant blaNDM-3, differing from blaNDM-1 by a single nonsynonymous SNP conferring a putative peptide sequence change at the 95th position (ASP ÕASN). The second was an Enterobacter cloacae harboring blaNDM-1. Further genetic characterization included identification of additional $\beta$-lactamase and aminoglycoside resistance genes. Legacy antimicrobials were used for treatment. Oral therapy with nitrofurantoin was successful in one case, while combination of colistin and rifampicin was required in the second patient.

17889,maybe,rossney2007,article,"Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) carrying pvl is an emerging problem worldwide. CA-MRSA tends to harbor staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec type IV (SCCmec IV), to be non-multiantibiotic resistant, and to have different genotypes from the local hospital-acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA). However, in Ireland, 80{\%} of HA-MRSA isolates have the non-multiantibiotic-resistant genotype ST22-MRSA-IV. This study investigated MRSA isolates from Ireland (CA-MRSA, health care-associated MRSA, and HA-MRSA) for the carriage of pvl and determined the genotypic characteristics of all pvl-positive isolates identified. All 1,389 MRSA isolates were investigated by antibiogram-resistogram typing and SmaI DNA macrorestriction analysis. pvl-positive isolates were further characterized by multilocus sequence typing and SCCmec, agr, and toxin gene typing. Twenty-five (1.8{\%}) MRSA isolates belonging to six genotypes (ST30, ST8, ST22, ST80, ST5, and ST154) harbored pvl. Nineteen of these (76{\%}) were CA-MRSA isolates, but a prospective study of MRSA isolates from 401 patients showed that only 6.7{\%} (2/30) of patients with CA-MRSA yielded pvl-positive isolates. Thus, pvl cannot be used as a sole marker for CA-MRSA. Fifty-two percent of pvl-positive MRSA isolates were recovered from patients with skin and soft tissue infections; thirty-six percent were from patients of non-Irish ethnic origin, reflecting the increasing heterogeneity of the Irish population due to immigration. All 25 pvl-positive isolates carried SCCmec IV; 14 (56{\%}) harbored SCCmec IV.1 or IV.3, and the remaining 11 isolates could not be subtyped.

This report describes the first KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates identified in Norway (n=6) and the second isolate from Sweden. METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility profiles were determined using Etest. PCR and sequencing were used to determine the bla(KPC) variant, the surrounding genetic structure and the presence of AmpC and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase genes. PFGE and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) were used for epidemiological comparisons. Localization of bla(KPC) was investigated by S1 nuclease digestion, followed by PFGE and Southern blot hybridization. RESULTS: All isolates expressed a multidrug-resistant phenotype with some variability in the carbapenem susceptibility profile. The Norwegian isolates carried bla(KPC-2), while the Swedish isolate carried bla(KPC-3). All isolates carried TEM-1, but were negative for bla(CTX-M) and bla(AmpC) genes. SHV-11 and SHV-12 were detected in the Norwegian isolates, while the Swedish isolate carried only SHV-11. Isolates from four patients were associated with import from Greece (n=3) and Israel. The other isolates were probably associated with local transmissions. PFGE and MLST showed that the isolates were clonally related, with three isolates displaying ST258, a single locus variant of ST11 previously associated with the clonal spread of CTX-M-15-producing K. pneumoniae in Hungary.

The analysis by electron microscopy showed that the isolates presented morphological and ultrastructural cellular changes when subjected to a clinically relevant concentration of antimicrobials alone or in combination. When subjected to meropenem, they presented retraction of the cytoplasmic material, rupture of the cell wall and extravasation of the cytoplasmic content. When submitted to polymyxin B, the isolates showed condensation of the ribosomes, DNA clotting, cell wall thickening and the presence of membrane compartment.

18812,maybe,sendi2016,article,"Streptococcus agalactiae (group B Streptococcus [GBS]) is a leading cause of sepsis in neonates. The rate of invasive GBS disease in nonpregnant adults also continues to climb. Aminoglycosides alone have little or no effect on GBS, but synergistic killing with penicillin has been shown in vitro. High-level gentamicin resistance (HLGR) in GBS isolates, however, leads to the loss of a synergistic effect. We therefore performed a multicenter study to determine the frequency of HLGR GBS isolates and to elucidate the molecular mechanisms leading to gentamicin resistance. From eight centers in four countries, 1,128 invasive and colonizing GBS isolates were pooled and investigated for the presence of HLGR. We identified two strains that displayed HLGR (BSU1203 and BSU452), both of which carried the aacA-aphD gene, typically conferring HLGR. However, only one strain (BSU1203) also carried the previously described chromosomal gentamicin resistance transposon designated Tn3706. For the other strain (BSU452), plasmid purification and subsequent DNA sequencing resulted in the detection of plasmid pIP501 carrying a remnant of a Tn3 family transposon. Its ability to confer HLGR was proven by transfer into an Enterococcus faecalis isolate. Conversely, loss of HLGR was documented after curing both GBS BSU452 and the transformed E. faecalis strain from the plasmid. This is the first report showing plasmid-mediated HLGR in GBS. Thus, in our clinical GBS isolates, HLGR is mediated both chromosomally and extrachromosomally.",P Sendi and M Furitsch and S Mauerer and C Florindo and B C Kahl and S Shabayek and R Berner and B Spellerberg,"1098-65960066-4804",Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy,"DNA flanking region,DNA sequence,Streptococcus agalactiae,adult,antibiotic resistance,article,bacterial gene,bacterial strain,bacterium identification,case report,chromosomal parameters,ciprofloxacin,genetic variability,gentamicin,group B streptococcal infection,high level gentamicin resistance,human,male,nonhuman,nucleotide sequence,priority journal,transposon",1702--1707,{Chromosomally and extrachromosomally mediated high-level gentamicin resistance in Streptococcus agalactiae},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l608798000 http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/aac.01933-15 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=10986596{\&}id=doi:10.1128{\%}2faac.01933-15{\&}atitle=chromosomally+and+extrac,60,2016,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,maybe,jake,no,erica,allison,zach_2,yes,zm_2.csv,NA,NA,NA,yes,journal
18873,maybe,serwin2014,article,"Gonorrhoea, according to the latest World Health Organization (WHO) estimates in 2008, is the most frequent bacterial sexually transmitted infection globally, accounting for 106.1 million new cases among adults. Of those cases, 3.4 (3.2{\%}) million were in the WHO European Region. In the European Union and European Economic Area, the incidence of reported cases was 12.6 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2011. The highest incidences were noted in the United Kingdom (37.1), Latvia (24.4) and Ireland (18.6). However, in Poland from 2000 to 2011 the reported incidence declined and was only 0.8-0.9 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2011, that might indicate a suboptimal diagnostics and incomplete case reporting and epidemiological surveillance. A study surveying the diagnostics for gonorrhoea and the case reporting system, including the local and national epidemiological surveillance, in Poland is recommended. The high resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae to nearly all antimicrobials introduced for treatment of gonorrhoea is an exceedingly serious problem globally. A few years ago the first extensively-drug resistant N. gonorrhoeae strains with high-level resistance to ceftriaxone, the last remaining option for first-line empirical monotherapy, were reported. Due to this emergent situation, in 2012 the WHO and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) launched a global action plan and regional response plan, respectively, to combat the spread of multidrug resistant N. gonorrhoeae. Additionally, an updated European guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of gonorrhoea, recommending treatment with ceftriaxone together with azithromycin, was published in 2012. Worryingly, no antimicrobial susceptibility data for N. gonorrhoeae strains circulating in Poland have been internationally reported in several decades. It is imperative to implement some regular and quality assured antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance for N. gonorrhoeae in Poland and the official Polish treatment guidelines (from 1970s) recommending penicillin G as first-line treatment for gonorrhoea need to be promptly revised.",A B Serwin and M Koper and M Unemo,"0033-2100 (print)0033-2100",Przegl Epidemiol,",*Drug Resistance,Adolescent,Adult,Aged,Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use,Azithromycin/therapeutic use,Bacterial,Ceftriaxone/therapeutic use,Epidemiological Monitoring,Europe,Europe/epidemiology,Female,Forecasting,Gonorrhea/*drug therapy/*epidemiology,Humans,Incidence,Internationality,Male,Middle Aged,Neisseria gonorrhoeae,Neisseria gonorrhoeae/drug effects,Penicillin G/therapeutic use,Poland,Poland/epidemiology,United Kingdom,United Kingdom/epidemiology,World Health Organization,Young Adult,adolescent,adult,aged,antibiotic resistance,antiinfective agent,article,azithromycin,ceftriaxone,drug effect,epidemiological monitoring,female,forecasting,gonorrhea,human,incidence,international cooperation,male,middle aged,penicillin G,world health organization,young adult","39--44,127--131",{Gonorrhoea in 21st century--international and Polish situation},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l373849768 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=00332100{\&}id=doi:{\&}atitle=gonorrhoea+in+21st+century--international+and+polish+situation.{\&}stitle=przegl+epidemi,68,2014,1,"from duplicate 1 (gonorrhoea in 21st century--international and polish situation - serwin, a b; koper, m; unemo, m)serwin, agnieszka beatakoper, martaunemo, magnusjournal articlepolandprzegl epidemiol. 2014;68(1):39-44, 127-31.",NA,7/10/14,"engpol",25004630,yes,erica,no,mushtaq,zach,zach_2,yes,zm_2.csv,NA,NA,zm_2_1.mex,yes,journal

A case of persistent methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) bacteremia in the setting of right-sided endocarditis in a 38-year-old man with a history of intravenous drug use is presented. He developed de novo resistance to daptomycin during therapy after several courses of antibiotics, with subsequent clinical failure. Isolates were identified by molecular characterization to be community-acquired MRSA 10 (USA300). To the authors' knowledge, the present case was the first in Canada to involve the de novo development of daptomycin resistance with clinical failure due to MRSA during therapy for endocarditis. Clinicians and microbiologists must be aware of this phenomenon given the implications for treatment and transmission of the strain. It also raises questions regarding the use of daptomycin in settings of heavily pretreated patients with persistent MRSA bacteremia. {\textcopyright}2010 Pulsus Group Inc.

ST398 BSI incidence showed a seven-fold increase during the study period (0.002 per 1,000 patient days in 2007 vs. 0.014 in 2010). ST398 BSI isolates differed from the pig-borne multiresistant clone: 17/18 BSI isolates were methicillin susceptible and none was of t011, t034 or t108 pig-borne spa-types. ST398 BSI isolates had homogenous resistance patterns (15/18 with only Ery(r)) and prophagic content (all harboured the hlb-converting Sau3int phage). The clustering of BSI and pig-borne isolates by spa-typing and MLVA, the occurrence of Sau3int phage in BSI isolates and the lack of this phage in pig-borne isolates suggest that the emergence of BSI isolates could have arisen from horizontal transfer, at least of the Sau3int phage, in genetically diverse MSSA ST398 isolates. The acquisition of the phage likely plays a role in the increasing ability of the lysogenic ST398 isolates to colonize human. The mode of acquisition of the non pig-borne ST398 isolates by our 18 patients remains unclear. ST398 BSI were diagnosed in patients lacking livestock exposure and were significantly associated with digestive portals of entry (3/18 [16.7{\%}] for ST398 vs. 19/767 [2.5{\%}] for non ST398 BSI; p = .012).

METHODS: Susceptibility testing against first- and second-line drugs was performed on isolated Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains. Subsequently, the strains identified as XDR or TDR M tuberculosis were subjected to spoligotyping and variable numbers of tandem repeats (VNTR). RESULTS: Of 146 MDR-TB strains, 8 XDR isolates (5.4{\%}) and 15 TDR isolates (10.3{\%}) were identified. The remaining strains were either susceptible (67{\%}) or had other resistant patterns (20{\%}). Overall, the median of treatments and drugs previously received by MDR-TB patients was two courses of therapy of 15 months' duration with five drugs (isoniazid [INH], rifampicin [RF], streptomycin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide). The median of in vitro drug resistance for all studied cases was INH and RF. The XDR or TDR strains were collected from both immigrants (Afghan, 30.4{\%}; Azerbaijani, 8.6{\%}; Iraqi, 4.3{\%}) and Iranian (56.5{\%}) MDR-TB cases. In such cases, the smear and cultures remained positive after 18 months of medium treatment with second-line drugs (ethionamide, para-aminosalicylic acid, cycloserine, ofloxacin, amikacin, and ciprofloxacin). Spoligotyping revealed Haarlem (39.1{\%}), Beijing (21.7{\%}), EAI (21.7{\%}), and CAS (17.3{\%}) superfamilies of M tuberculosis. These superfamilies had different VNTR profiles, which eliminated the recent transmission among MDR-TB cases.

21983,maybe,voulgari2013,article,"Objectives: First detected in Enterobacteriaceae isolates in Turkey, the OXA-48 carbapenemase has gradually disseminated in the wider Mediterranean area and Europe. Despite reports from other European regions, until now no such isolates have been detected in Greece. We describe the characteristics of the first outbreak caused by OXA-48-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae in Greece. Methods: From December 2011 to March 2012, 13 ertapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates, which were positive by the modified Hodge test while remaining negative by phenotypic screening for metallo-$\beta$-lactamase (MBL) and KPC production, were recovered from nine patients. Patient records were retrieved to access patterns of acquisition. Resistance genes were identified by PCR and sequencing. ompK35, ompK36 and the genetic environment of the blaOXA-48 gene were investigated. Plasmid profiling, conjugation experiments, PFGE and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) were performed. Results: All isolates harboured the blaOXA-48 gene along with the blaCTX-M-15 and blaOXA-1 genes. The blaOXA-48 gene was located on a self-transferable IncL/M-type plasmid of {\~{}}62 kb, which harboured no other resistance genes. IS1999 was located upstream of the blaOXA-48 gene. Genetic disruptions of the ompK35 and ompK36 genes were not detected. The isolates belonged to a unique PFGE clone and MLST assigned them to sequence type ST11. All cases were characterized as hospital acquired and none of them was linked to immigration or history of travel in endemic areas. Conclusions: Carbapenem resistance due to MBL and KPC carbapenemases is currently on an endemic scale in Greece and this report highlights the wider undetected dissemination of yet another carbapenemase in this region. {\textcopyright} The Author 2012.

22703,maybe,wormser2010,article,"Background. Babesiosis is an emerging tickborne malaria-like infection principally caused by Babesia microti. This infection typically resolves either spontaneously or after administration of a 7-10-day course of azithromycin plus atovaquone or clindamycin plus quinine. Although certain highly immunocompromised patients may respond suboptimally to these drug regimens, unlike the situation with malaria there has been no reported evidence that the cause of treatment failure is infection with drug-resistant strains of B. microti. Methods. Emergence of drug resistance in B. microti was defined as the development of a microbiologic relapse (recurrent parasitemia or a marked increase in parasitemia) in association with both clinical and laboratory abnormalities indicative of active babesiosis in a patient after ä´ 28 days of uninterrupted antibabesia drug therapy and while still receiving treatment. Results. The clinical case histories of 3 highly immunocompromised patients who received a subcurative course of azithromycin-atovaquone associated with the eventual development of resistance to this drug regimen are described. One of the 3 patients died of complications related to babesiosis. Conclusions. B. microti may become resistant to azithromycin-atovaquone during the treatment of babesiosis with this combined drug regimen in highly immunocompromised patients. Although research is needed to de-termine the optimal therapy for highly immunocompromised patients with babesiosis, reducing the level of immunosuppression when possible would appear to be a desirable strategy. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

23199,maybe,yu2014a,article,"BACKGROUND: Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) infection is a serious public health problem. The third-generation extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ESCs) have been used as the first-line treatment for NG infection for almost three decades. However, in recent years, treatment failures with the oral third-generation ESCs have been reported worldwide. This study aimed to estimate worldwide susceptibility rates of NG to cefixime and cefpodoxime by analyzing data from all relevant published studies. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Two researchers independently searched five databases to identify studies on susceptibilities of NG to cefixime and cefpodoxime published between January 1, 1984 and October 15, 2012. A fixed-effect model was used to perform group analysis, and a chi2 test was employed to make subgroup comparison. Publication bias was assessed with the Begg rank correlation test. The pooled susceptibility rate of NG isolates to cefixime was 99.8{\%} (95{\%} CI: 99.7{\%}-99.8{\%}). The cefixime susceptibility rate of NG isolates from men was significantly lower than that from patients without information of gender or from men and women; the susceptibility rate of NG isolates from Asia was significantly lower than that from other continents; and the susceptibility rate of NG isolates collected before or during 2003 was significantly higher than that after 2003. The pooled susceptibility rate of NG isolates to cefpodoxime was 92.8{\%} (95{\%} CI: 89.0{\%}-95.3{\%}), which was lower than that to cefixime (92.8{\%} vs. 99.8{\%}, chi2 = 951.809, P{\textless}0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The susceptibility rate of NG isolates to cefixime varied with the gender of patients and geographical location from which NG isolates were collected, and declined with time. The reported lower susceptibility rate of NG isolates to cefixime and associated treatment failures, as well as the emergence of NG strains with cephalosporin resistance call for the more effective control of NG infection and the development of new antibiotics.",R X Yu and Y Yin and G Q Wang and S C Chen and B J Zheng and X Q Dai and Y Han and Q Li and G Y Zhang and X Chen,1932-6203,PLoS ONE,",Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use,Asia,Cefixime/*therapeutic use,Ceftizoxime/*analogs {\&} derivatives/therapeutic use,Female,Gonorrhea/*drug therapy/epidemiology/*microbiology,Humans,Male,Neisseria gonorrhoeae,Neisseria gonorrhoeae/isolation {\&} purification/*me,antibiotic sensitivity,article,bacterial strain,bacterium isolate,cefixime,cefpodoxime,controlled study,data base,drug screening,female,gender,geography,human,male,meta analysis (topic),minimum inhibitory concentration,nonhuman,patient information,population research,systematic review",e87849,{Worldwide susceptibility rates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates to cefixime and cefpodoxime: A systematic review and meta-analysis},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l373071452 http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0087849 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=19326203{\&}id=doi:10.1371{\%}2fjournal.pone.0087849{\&}atitle=worldwid,9,2014,1,"from duplicate 2 (worldwide susceptibility rates of neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates to cefixime and cefpodoxime: a systematic review and meta-analysis - yu, r x; yin, y; wang, g q; chen, s c; zheng, b j; dai, x q; han, y; li, q; zhang, g y; chen, x)1932-6203yu, rui-xingyin, yuepingwang, guan-qunchen, shao-chunzheng, bing-jiedai, xiu-qinhan, yanli, qizhang, guo-yichen, xiangshengjournal articlemeta-analysisresearch support, non-u.s. gov'treviewunited statesplos one. 2014 jan 31;9(1):e87849. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0087849. ecollection 2014.",10.1371/journal.pone.0087849,2/6/14,eng,24498212,yes,erica,maybe,zach,zach,zach_2,yes,zm_2.csv,NA,NA,NA,yes,journal

In 2006, we showed that resistance to anti-tuberculosis drugs remained frequent in Sinaloa. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to describe drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) trends and to investigate the probability that patients acquire resistance to first-line anti-TB drugs on recurrence after treatment in Sinaloa. METHODS: Sputum specimens were collected from patients diagnosed with TB at all the health care institutions of Sinaloa during 1997-2005. Isolates were tested for susceptibility to first-line drugs. RESULTS: Among 671 isolates tested from 1997 to 2002, the overall resistance rate was 34.9{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 31.2-38.4) with a 1.2{\%} increase per year (Chi-square=4.258, p=0.03906). The prevalence of multi-drug resistance (MDR) was 17.9{\%} (95{\%} CI 14.9-20.7) with a 1.2{\%} increase per year (Chi-square=8.352, p=0.00385). Of 50 patients registered twice between 1997 and 2005, 15 were fully susceptible at first registration, of whom six (40{\%}) acquired drug resistance. Of 35 cases with any drug resistance at first registration, 21 (60{\%}) came to acquire resistance to at least one other drug. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of drug-resistant TB increased during 1997-2005 in Sinaloa.

There is almost no data regarding methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) prevalence in both countries. This study was conducted to investigate the prevalence and molecular epidemiology of S. aureus and MRSA nasal carriage among outpatients attending primary health care centers in two big cities in both countries. A total of 206 nasal swabs were obtained, 103 swabs from each country. S. aureus isolates were characterized by antibiotic susceptibility, presence of mecA and PVL genes, SCCmec-typing and spa typing, the corresponding Multi locus sequence typing clonal complex was assigned for each spa type based on Ridom StaphType database. MRSA was detected in 32{\%} of the Egyptian outpatients while it was found in 25{\%} of the Saudi Arabian outpatients. All MRSA isolates belonged to SCCmec type V and IVa, where some isolates in Saudi Arabia remained nontypeable. Surprisingly PVL(+) isolates were low in frequency: 15{\%} of MRSA Egyptian isolates and 12{\%} of MRSA isolates in Saudi Arabia. Two novel spa types were detected t11839 in Egypt, and t11841 in Saudi Arabia. We found 8 spa types among 20 isolates from Egypt, and 12 spa types out of 15 isolates from Saudi Arabia.

Linezolid resistance in the VRE strain was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction and sequence analysis, subsequently. Linezolid-resistant two isolates were identified as E.faecium by 16S rRNA sequencing and both isolates had C2576U mutation in 23S rRNA gene.

296,maybe,aia2016,article,"Background Reliable estimates of the burden of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) are crucial for effective control and prevention of tuberculosis (TB). Papua New Guinea (PNG) is a high TB burden country with limited information on the magnitude of the MDR-TB problem. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in four PNG provinces: Madang, Morobe, National Capital District and Western Province. Patient sputum samples were tested for rifampicin resistance by the Xpert MTB/RIF assay and those showing the presence of resistance underwent phenotypic susceptibility testing to first- and second-line anti-TB drugs including streptomycin, isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, ofloxacin, amikacin, kanamycin and capreomycin. Results Among 1,182 TB patients enrolled in the study, MDR-TB was detected in 20 new (2.7{\%}; 95{\%} confidence intervals [CI] 1.1-4.3{\%}) and 24 previously treated (19.1{\%}; 95{\%}CI: 8.5-29.8{\%}) TB cases. No case of extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) was detected. Thirty percent (6/20) of new and 33.3{\%} (8/24) of previously treated cases with MDR-TB were detected in a single cluster in Western Province. Conclusion In PNG the proportion of MDR-TB in new cases is slightly lower than the regional average of 4.4{\%} (95{\%}CI: 2.6-6.3{\%}). A large proportion of MDR-TB cases were identified from a single hospital in Western Province, suggesting that the prevalence of MDR-TB across the country is heterogeneous. Future surveys should further explore this finding. The survey also helped strengthening the use of smear microscopy and Xpert MTB/RIF testing as diagnostic tools for TB in the country.This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

340,maybe,akinyemi2015,article,"Purpose: The global spread of bla{\textless}inf{\textgreater}CTX-M-I{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producingSalmonella spp. remains a major threat to treatment and control. Evidence of emergence and spread of this marker are lacking in Nigeria. This study investigated bla{\textless}inf{\textgreater}CTX-M-I{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} ESBL production amongSalmonella isolates from hospitalized patients. Methods: Patients (158 total) made up of two groups were evaluated. Group A was composed of 135 patients with persistent pyrexia and group B was composed of 23 gastroenteritis patients and their stool samples. Samples were cultured, and isolates were identified and were subjected to antibiotic susceptibility testing by standard methods. Isolates were further screened for ESBL production, bla{\textless}inf{\textgreater}CTX-M-I{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} genes and transferability by double disk synergy test, plasmid extraction, polymerase chain reaction, and conjugation experiment. Results: Thirty-five (25.9{\%}) Salmonella isolates were identified from group A, of which 74.3{\%} wereS. typhi, 22.9{\%} were S. paratyphi and two (5.7{\%}) were invasive non-typhoidal S. enteritidis. NinePlasmodium falciparum infections were recorded, four of which were identified as co-infections with typhoidal Salmonella. Only two (8.7{\%}) S. enteritidis samples were obtained from group B (P{\textgreater}0.05). A total of 24 isolates were ESBL-positive, eliciting resistance to five to seven antibiotics, and were multiple-drug resistant. ESBL production due to the bla{\textless}inf{\textgreater}CTX-M-I{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} gene cluster was detected in eleven (45.8{\%}) Salmonella isolates. Nine (81.8{\%}) of the eleven bla{\textless}inf{\textgreater}CTX-M-I{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} ESBL producers were S. typhi and two (18.2{\%}) isolates were S. enteritidis. Four of nine S. typhi bla{\textless}inf{\textgreater}CTX-M-I{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} ESBL-producing strains harbored 23 kb self-transmissible plasmid that was co-transferred with cefotaxime and augmentin resistance to Escherichia coli j53-2 transconjugants. Conclusion: This study revealed the emergence of bla{\textless}inf{\textgreater}CTX-M-I{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} S. typhi as an agent of persistent pyrexia with potential to spread to other Enterobacteriaceae in Lagos, Nigeria.

442,maybe,alauzet2010,article,"Nonduplicate clinical isolates of Prevotella spp. recovered from patients hospitalized between 2003 and 2006 in two French tertiary-care teaching hospitals were investigated for their susceptibility to metronidazole and the presence of nim genes. Of the 188 strains tested, 3 isolates displayed reduced susceptibility to metronidazole after 48 h of incubation, while 27 additional isolates exhibited heterogeneous resistance after prolonged incubation; all 30 of the isolates were nim negative. Among the remaining 158 isolates, 7 nim-positive isolates were detected. All of these strains were identified as Prevotella baroniae by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and contained a new nim gene, named nimI, as determined by DNA sequence analysis. Chromosomal localization of this single-copy gene was demonstrated in all clinical isolates as well as in type strain P. baroniae DSM 16972 by using Southern hybridization. No known associated insertion sequence elements were detected upstream of the nimI gene in any of the nim-positive strains by PCR mapping. After prolonged exposure to metronidazole, stable resistant subpopulations could be selected in nimI-positive Prevotella isolates (n = 6) as well as in nim-negative Prevotella isolates (n = 6), irrespective of their initial susceptibility to this antibiotic. This study is the first description of a new nitroimidazole resistance gene in P. baroniae which seems to be silent and which might be intrinsic in this species.

A whole cell protein profile (as an alternative for serogrouping), in vitro toxin production and susceptibility to vancomycin, metronidazole and clindamycin were also investigated. All strains were typeable by both phenotypic and genotypic methods, and a total of 13 different PCR ribotypes were identified, of which seven (132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 142 and 143) were considered new types and accounted for 78.5{\%} of all samples evaluated (including hospital environments). A non-toxigenic C. difficile PCR ribotype 133 was detected in all children groups examined (inpatients, outpatients and healthy children), whilst toxigenic PCR ribotypes 015, 131, 134 and 135 were associated mostly with symptomatic children. Serogroups G and D were disseminated both in patients from the community and from the pediatric hospital, with group G prevalent among outpatient children. All strains were susceptible to vancomycin and metronidazole but high levels of resistance to clindamycin were found, especially among serogroups G and D. Co-existence of different ribotypes and serogroups in the same individual was observed.

474,yes,aldape2013,article,"Hypervirulent BI/NAP1/027 strains of Clostridium difficile have been associated with increased mortality of C. difficile infection (CDI). The emergence of highly fluoroquinolone (FLQ)-resistant BI/NAP1/027 strains suggests that FLQ exposure may be a risk factor for CDI development. However, the mechanism for this is not clear. We compared the effects of subinhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin on Toxin A and B gene expression and protein production in recent (strain 039) and historical (strain 5325) BI/NAP1/027 clinical isolates with high- and low-level ciprofloxacin resistance, respectively. In the highly ciprofloxacin-resistant isolate (strain 039), ciprofloxacin significantly and dose-dependently increased Toxin A gene expression and shifted its expression to earlier in its growth cycle; TcdB gene expression also increased but was less sensitive to low-dose ciprofloxacin. Maximal Toxin A/B production (4 ng ml -1) was increased twofold and occurred significantly earlier than in the untreated control. In strain 5325, ciprofloxacin at 0.25XMIC markedly increased both tcdA and tcdB expression but their temporal dynamics were unchanged. Maximal toxin production (250 ng ml -1) was reduced approximately threefold compared with that of the untreated control. These results demonstrate significant differences in ciprofloxacin-induced toxin gene expression and protein production among BI/ NAP1/027 isolates, and offer a new paradigm for FLQ-associated CDI caused by recent, highly antibiotic-resistant strains. {\textcopyright} 2013 SGM.",M J Aldape and A E Packham and D W Nute and A E Bryant and D L Stevens,0022-2615,Journal of Medical Microbiology,"Peptoclostridium difficile,RNA 16S,RNA isolation,agar gel electrophoresis,antibiotic resistance,article,bacterial RNA,bacterial genetics,bacterial growth,bacterial strain,bacterial toxin,bacterium isolate,ciprofloxacin,concentration response,controlled study,critically ill patient,exotoxin,gene expression,growth curve,human,minimum inhibitory concentration,nonhuman,nucleosome assembly protein 1,priority journal,real time polymerase chain reaction,toxin production,toxin synthesis",741--747,{Effects of ciprofloxacin on the expression and production of exotoxins by Clostridium difficile},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l368791959 http://dx.doi.org/10.1099/jmm.0.056218-0 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=00222615{\&}id=doi:10.1099{\%}2fjmm.0.056218-0{\&}atitle=effects+of+ciproflox,62,2013,part5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,yes,brooke,yes,nchedo,nchedo,zach_3,yes,zm_3.csv,NA,NA,zm_3_1.mex,yes,journal

AIM: We report an outbreak of PVL-MRSA in a regional neonatal unit in the UK involving three babies and three staff members. METHODS: Quinolone susceptibility was helpful in identifying potential PVL-MRSA but toxin gene profiling and sequence-based typing were required to distinguish between two PVL-MRSA strains present in the unit. FINDINGS: All three symptomatic babies and two staff carriers, one of whom was symptomatic, were found to be carrying the South West Pacific (SWP) clone of PVL-MRSA (ST30). One of the staff carriers had recently visited the Philippines and was thought to be the source of the outbreak. Control was established using standard infection control procedures but one baby with relapsing MRSA colonization has required more than 100 days in isolation.

714,maybe,amesur2014,article,"LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1: Recognize the emergence of invasive Klebsiella pneumoniae in non-Asian populations in the United States LEARNING OBJECTIVE 2: Diagnose and treat invasive Klebsiella pneumoniae in a timely fashion for better patient outcomes CASE: We present a case series of 10 patients with invasive community acquired Klebsiella pneumoniae infections at a county hospital from 2010 to 2013. The data for this study was collected retrospectively. Charts were reviewed for the patients' hospitalizations. Data collected included age, gender, race, recent travel, country of origin, type of infection, and evidence of dissemination. We gathered information about medical conditions and co-morbidities that may be risk factors for invasive infection, including diabetes mellitus, cancer, steroid use, recent chemotherapy, recent radiation therapy, lung disease, liver disease, alcohol use, kidney disease, and central line or catheter use. In our results, the age range of patients was between 24 and 75 years of age, with a median age of 51. Most of the patients were male (7). The ethnicities of the patients were five Latino, two Caucasian, two Asian, and one African-American. Four were born in the United States (2 Caucasian, 1 Latino, 1 African-American). Four were born in Mexico (all were Latino), and the remainder two patients were born in Asia (Laotian and Cambodian). One had travel history within the past 10 years to South East Asia, and another patient had travel history within the past 2 years to Mexico. The types of infections most commonly seen were liver abscesses (5), followed by soft tissue infections (3), pelvic abscess (1), and pyelonephritis (1). Of the soft tissue infections, one patient had Fournier gangrene, one had neck abscess, and one had necrotizing fasciitis. Seven of the patients showed evidence of disseminated disease including bacteremia (4), urinary tract infection (4), and lung involvement (2). Most patients were septic on presentation and seven patients had elevated liver enzymes. The most common risk factors associated with invasive K. pneumoniae infections were diabetes (40 {\%}), followed by renal failure (30 {\%}) and history of cancer (20 {\%}). All 10 of our patients survived after treatment with appropriate antibiotics. DISCUSSION: Klebsiella pneumoniae, a member of the Enterobacteriaceae family, is a common human bacterial pathogen that can cause urinary tract infections, pneumonias, bacteremia, and intra-abdominal infections. It is recognized as a highly pathogenic organism that causes disease in the community and nosocomial settings. Invasive K. pneumoniae was first described in the early 1980's in Taiwan as the cause of pyogenic liver abscess. Since then, its emergence is most notable in Asian countries causing not only liver abscess but also pneumonia, urinary tract infection, brain abscess, endophthalmitis, pyogenic meningitis, empyema, septic pulmonary emboli, and osteomyelitis. Over the last decade, there is an increasing rise of this syndrome in the United States, emphasizing the importance of early recognition, diagnosis, and treatment. Most of these invasive infections are caused by the hypermucoviscous serotypes K1 and K2 and genotypes magA and rmpA. Hypermucoviscosity increases the virulence of K. pneumoniae, making it resistant to phagocytosis. The phenotype is identified in the laboratory using the âstring test.â Patients with liver abscesses typically present with fever, chills, and abdominal pain. However, patients with invasive K. pneumoniae may present with leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, abnormal liver function tests, and increased glucose in the blood. Diabetes mellitus appears to be the most prevalent risk factor at 29 {\%}. Hospital mortality rate has been reported between 9 and 11 {\%}. Antibiotics are given based on culture and sensitivity results, although ceftriaxone has proven effective in most liver abscesses. While invasive K. pneumoniae infections are common and well reported in Asia, they are rare in the United States. There are few case reports published and only one sm ll case series described in California which reports infections affecting mostly patients of Asian descent. Previous cases in the United States occurred in primarily patients of Asian descent while our case series displayed a higher occurrence in Latino patients, which may indicate a different predisposition than previously reported for invasive infections in the United States. The emergence of K. pneumoniae in the United States, and most significantly in the Latino population, emphasizes the importance of recognizing invasive K. pneumoniae as the cause of liver abscesses, soft tissues infections, and other invasive diseases in non-Asian populations.",L S Amesur and D I Kim and J Persichino and M Sutjita and A Eskandari and V Jahangiri,0884-8734,Journal of General Internal Medicine,"African American,Asia,Asian,Cambodian,Caucasian,Enterobacteriaceae,Fournier gangrene,Hispanic,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Klebsiella pneumoniae infection,Mexico,Taiwan,United States,abdominal infection,abdominal pain,abscess,alcohol consumption,alcohol liver disease,antibiotic agent,bacteremia,bacterial meningitis,blood,brain abscess,case report,case study,catheter,ceftriaxone,central venous catheter,chemotherapy,community,diabetes mellitus,diagnosis,disease predisposition,diseases,empyema,endophthalmitis,ethnicity,fever,gender,genotype,glucose,hospitalization,human,hypertransaminasemia,infection,internal medicine,kidney disease,kidney failure,laboratory,leukocytosis,liver abscess,liver function test,lung,lung disease,lung embolism,male,morbidity,mortality,neck,necrotizing fasciitis,neoplasm,organisms,osteomyelitis,pathogenesis,patient,pelvis abscess,phagocytosis,phenotype,pneumonia,population,public hospital,pyelonephritis,pyogenic liver abscess,radiotherapy,risk factor,society,soft tissue,soft tissue infection,steroid,thrombocytopenia,travel,urinary tract infection,virulence",s271,{A case series of an emerging infection in the United States: Invasive klebsiella pneumoniae},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l71495305 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=08848734{\&}id=doi:{\&}atitle=a+case+series+of+an+emerging+infection+in+the+united+states{\%}3a+invasive+klebsiella+pne,29,2014,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,yes,allison,no,erica,mushtaq,zach_3,no,zm_3.csv,could not find full-text,NA,NA,no,journal

The prevalence of infection or colonisation is variable among CF centres. We report here the first epidemiological data about A. xylosoxidans in a French CF centre: Dijon, Burgundy. METHODS: All isolates recovered from the patients affiliated with our centre in 2010 since their first visit were included. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by disk diffusion method and E-test. Molecular epidemiology was performed by Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) and compared with repetitive sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR, DiversiLab(R)). We also sequenced the constitutive bla-oxa-114 gene. RESULTS: Out of 120 patients, 21 (17.5{\%}) had at least one positive culture with A. xylosoxidans since they started to receive routine care in our CF centre (447 isolates). Median age at first positive culture was 16 years (range 3-34 years). Most patients were colonised by their own strain, cross-contamination was very rare. We observed two cases of intra-family spread. DiversiLab(R) is a useful tool as efficient as PFGE to compare isolates recovered simultaneously from different patients when an outbreak is suspected. However, PFGE remains the reference method for long-term survey of chronically colonised patients. We detected new OXA-114 variants and the new oxacillinase OXA-243 (88{\%} amino acid identity with OXA-114). Acquired resistance to ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime and carbapenems was frequent. In 2010, 7 patients harboured strains resistant to ceftazidime, 6 patients strains with decreased susceptibility to carbapenems (especially meropenem) and 12 patients strains resistant to ciprofloxacin. CONCLUSIONS: In our centre, the high prevalence of colonisation is not due to cross-contamination.

It rarely causes spontaneous disease, but its incidence is increased in immunocompromised patients, and it has previously been described in peritoneal dialysis and transplant patients. Case Report: A 78-year-old gentleman presented with nephrotic syndrome (proteinuria 18 g/day, serum alb 18 g/L) and associated acute kidney injury, requiring dialysis. Background history included hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Kidney biopsy revealed minimal change disease (MCD), as well as acute tubular necrosis. He was commenced on oral prednisone (75 mg/day), and weaned off dialysis. Initial treatment was complicated by steroid-induced delirium, necessitating a reduction in prednisolone to 50 mg/day with some effect. Six weeks after diagnosis, the patient was noted to have developed blistering skin lesions on his distal right upper limb that were migrating proximally, and not responsive to standard antibiotic therapy. Specialist infectious diseases advice was sought, with skin swabs positive for M. chelonae (doxycycline-resistant). Steroid dose was halved, and the patient was commenced on combination antibiotic therapy, clarithromycin and linezolid, for 9 months, with slow resolution of the lesions. Prednisolone was held at 25 mg/day for the next 2 months, and then tapered. The patient's renal function stabilised at â¼60 mL/min after an unexplained drop to 30 mL/min, with an ongoing decline in proteinuria, despite sub-optimal steroid dosing. The patient now remains free of new skin lesions post completion of anti-tuberculous therapy, with continued reduction in proteinuria, and stable renal function. Conclusions: This is the first reported case of cutaneous M. chelonae infection in a patient being treated with steroids for MCD.

1021,maybe,arredondo-garcia2007,article,"Abstract. Background: Growing antibiotic resistance demands the constant reassessment of antimicrobial efficacy, particularly in countries with wide antibiotic abuse, where higher resistance prevalence is often found. Knowledge of resistance trends is particularly important when prescribing antibiotics empirically, as is usually the case for urinary tract infections (UTIs). Currently, in Mexico City, ampicillin, cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole), and ciprofloxacin are used as {""}first-line{""} antibiotic treatment for UTI. Objective: The aim of this study was to analyze the resistance of bacterial isolates to antibiotics, with a focus on first-line antibiotics, in Mexican pediatric patients and sexually active or pregnant female outpatients. Methods: In this multicenter susceptibility analysis, bacterial isolates from urine samples collected from pediatric patients and sexually-active or pregnant female outpatients presenting with acute, uncomplicated UTIs in Mexico City from January 2006 through June 2006, were included in the study. Samples were tested for susceptibility to 10 antibiotics by the disk-diffusion method. Results: Four-hundred and seventeen bacterial isolates were derived from sexually active or pregnant female outpatients (324 Escherichia coli) and pediatric patients (93 Klebsiella pneumoniae). We found a high prevalence of resistance towards the drugs used as {""}first-line{""} when treating UTIs: ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, and ciprofloxacin (79{\%}, 60{\%}, and 24{\%} resistance, respectively). Ninety-eight percent of K pneumoniae isolates were resistant to ampicillin, whereas 66{\%} of the E coli isolates were resistant to cotrimoxazole. Resistance towards third-generation cephalosporins was also high (6{\%}-8{\%} of E coli and 10{\%}-28{\%} of K pneumoniae). This was possibly caused by chromosomal $\beta$-lactamases, as 30{\%} of all isolates were also resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanate. In contrast, 98{\%} of the E coli isolates and 84{\%} of the K pneumoniae strains (96{\%} of all isolates) were found to be susceptible to nitrofurantoin, which has been in clinical use for much longer than most other drugs in this study. Conclusion: In these urine samples from laboratories in Mexico City, resistance of K pneumoniae and E coli isolates to first-line treatment (ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, or ciprofloxacin) of UTI was high, whereas most E coli and K pneumoniae isolates were susceptible to nitrofurantoin and the fourth-generation cephalosporin cefepime.

Admission and periodic active surveillance cultures showed a downward trend of CRKP clinical cases over the following months to zeros in July and August. All patients had prolonged hospital stay before CRKP detection and the majority had recent history of carbapenem use (75{\%}), colonization/infection with other MDROs (75{\%}), surgical procedures (80{\%}), indwelling devices (83{\%}), and mechanical ventilation (75{\%}).

Human infections caused by . Chromobacterium violaceum are infrequent. There are a few reported cases in several countries. Those infections appear after a skin contact with soil or contaminated water. Infections can progress to necrotizing metastatatic lesions and multiple abscesses of the lung, liver, skin, spleen, lymph nodes and brain with fatal septicemia. Infections caused by this bacterium have a high lethality rate, with a low recovery rate among survivors. It has been described that this bacterium is resistant to several antibiotics. Materials and methods: . Chromobacterium violaceum was isolated, cultivated, and identified from oysters from thirteen different restaurants in Mexico City and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed. Results: Four isolations of . Chromobacterium violaceum were obtained from oysters. Three of them corresponded to biotype 36 and all of them had a confidence factor of 0.987. All isolations were resistant to Carbencillin, Cephalothin and Cephotaxime. Two isolations were also resistant to Ampicillin and one was resistant to Amikacin. All isolations were sensitive to Ceftriaxone, Chloramphenicol, Gentamicin, Netilmicin, Nitrofurantoin, Pefloxacine and Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole. Conclusions: The presence of . Chromabacterium violaceum in food obtained from salt marshes that usually are eaten fresh (like oysters) means a high potential risk for human health because this bacterium has been associated with high morbidity and mortality. In our report, this bacterium showed resistance to several antibacterial agents. Patients should be cautions when eating fresh seafood, and healthcare personnel should suspect an infection caused by . Chromobacterium violaceum if the patient presents with sepsis, enteritis or abscesses and they have risk factors for acquiring this bacterium in order to provide prompt treatment and reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with the infection.

Methods: The authors conducted a cross-sectional nasopharyngeal swab survey of 151 children affected with HIV presenting for routine outpatient care in West Bengal, India. Results: 151 HIV affected children were enrolled. The median age was 6, 148/151 children were HIV positive, 65{\%} had moderate to severe malnutrition, 53{\%} were moderately to severely immunosuppressed, 17{\%} were on antiretroviral therapy (ART), 90{\%} were on cotrimoxazole prophylaxis (TMP/SMX). None had received the pneumococcal or Hib conjugate vaccines. Hib prevalence was 13{\%} and pneumococcal prevalence was 28{\%}. Children with normal or moderate immune suppression had high rates of colonization compared to those with severe immunosuppression (71{\%} Hib, 61{\%} pneumococcus). Hib and pneumococcal isolates had high rates of resistance to tested antibiotics including TMP/SMX and third generation cephalosporins. Neither ART nor TMP/SMX prevented colonization. Children colonized with multidrug resistant isolates had high rates of exposure to TMP/SMX. Conclusions: HIV infection, late access to ART, high rates of colonization to resistant organisms and lack of access to vaccines makes this population vulnerable to invasive disease from Hib and pneumococcus. {\textcopyright} 2010 Dr. K C Chaudhuri Foundation.",S D Bhattacharya and S K Niyogi and S Bhattacharyya and S Fitzwater and N Chauhan and A Sudar and S Mandal,0019-5456,Indian Journal of Pediatrics,"Haemophilus influenzae type b,Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine,Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient,Human immunodeficiency virus infection,India,Pneumococcus vaccine,Streptococcus pneumoniae,ampicillin,antibiotic agent,antibiotic prophylaxis,antibiotic resistance,antibiotic sensitivity,antiretrovirus agent,article,azithromycin,bacterial colonization,bacterium carrier,bacterium identification,bacterium isolate,cefixime,cefoperazone,cefotaxime,cefoxitin,ceftriaxone,cefuroxime,cephalosporin derivative,child,chloramphenicol,cohort analysis,controlled study,cotrimoxazole,cross-sectional study,drug exposure,erythromycin,female,health care access,human,immune deficiency,immunization,infant,major clinical study,male,malnutrition,multidrug resistance,nasopharynx,newborn,nonhuman,outpatient care,oxacillin,preschool child,rifampicin,risk factor,school child,tetracycline,throat culture,tuberculosis,tuberculostatic agent,vulnerable population",423--429,{High rates of colonization with drug resistant hemophilus influenzae type B and Streptococccus Pneumoniae in unvaccinated HIV infected children from West Bengal},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l51196750 http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12098-010-0310-z http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=00195456{\&}id=doi:10.1007{\%}2fs12098-010-0310-z{\&}atitle=high+rates+of+c,78,2011,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,maybe,cale,maybe,ayomide,ayomide,zach_3,yes,zm_3.csv,NA,NA,zm_3_1.mex,yes,journal

Methods: A CRE outbreak investigation was conducted in a 77- bed LTACH from Dec. 2010 through Aug. 2012. Retrospective chart review of 30 patients with CRE was conducted to identify the source and modes of transmission, analyze the incidence pattern, and determine treatment outcomes. Culture sensitivity analyses were also conducted to evaluate resistance patterns among isolates. Results: Of the 30 patients with CRE, 24 (80{\%}) were infected and 6 (20{\%}) were colonized with KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumonia (KPC-Kp). The mean age of patients was 70 Â±11.5 years, 19 patients (63{\%}) were female, and 25 patients (83{\%}) were African-American. Among the 18 patients (60{\%}) who received treatment, 15 patients received monotherapy and 3 received combination therapy. Negative cultures were obtained for 4 patients (22{\%}) within two weeks of the first positive culture result, while treatment failure was observed for the remaining 14 (78{\%}) receiving treatment. Culture sensitivity analyses indicated that all isolates shared a common multi-drug resistant phenotype, with resistance to amoxicillin/ clavulanate, ticarcillin/clavulanate, piperacillin/tazobactam, tobramycin, carbapenems, 2nd-,3rd-, and 4th-generation cephalosporins, aztreonam, fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin), and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Additionally, of the 18 isolates with susceptibility data for colistin, 3 (17{\%}) were resistant, with MIC values of 1, 3, and 16 mg/L. Furthermore, of the 17 isolates with susceptibility data for tigecycline, 3 (18{\%}) were resistant, with MIC values of 4 mg/L. Conclusions: Both monotherapy and combination treatment regimens were largely ineffective in eradicating this infection, including regimens containing colistin and tigecycline.

2444,maybe,bose2014,article,"Introduction: To study clarithromycin resistance patterns of H. pylori infections in an ambulatory setting utilizing PCR based assays as a guide for appropriate therapy. Methods: A total of 332 patients with suspected H. pylori infection from September 2013 to March 2014 were tested and followed in the ambulatory physician office setting. Stool and tissue specimens were collected and analyzed by PCR for antibiotic resistance patterns. Presence of H. pylori after antibiotic resistant guided therapy was re-evaluated in patients at follow-up visits. Results: The use of the new PCR based resistance testing showed 84/129 (65{\%}) were resistant to clarithromycin. In our group only 40 of the 84 who received the resistance guided therapy came for follow-up and retesting. Of the 40, 26 were negative for H. pylori showing a 65{\%} eradication rate in our study group despite utilizing non-clarithromycin based treatment regimens. Conclusion: Despite using only clarithromycin antibiotic resistance guide therapy we were able to achieve a modest 65{\%} eradication rate in our study group. The confounding variable that could have contributed to this could have been prior infection, cross resistances to other antibiotics used, recurrence, and reinfection. Incorporating resistance testing to other antibiotics and improving patient adherence in the community setting may infer a higher eradication rates in the future. The PCR based testing is now widely feasible and attainable to the community and academic practitioners.

Currently KPC (class A), NDM (class B), and OXA-48 types (class D) are the most globally widespread carbapenemases. However, among the GES-type class A extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) there are variants that hydrolyze carbapenems, with blaGES-5 being the most common. Two Escherichia coli and two Serratia marcescens harboring blaGES-5 on plasmids were isolated by the Canadian Nosocomial Infection Surveillance Program (CNISP) from four different patients in a single hospital over a 2-year period. Complete sequencing of the blaGES-5 plasmids indicated that all four had nearly identical backbones consisting of genes for replication, partitioning, and stability, but contained variant accessory regions consisting of mobile elements and antimicrobial resistance genes. The plasmids were of a novel replicon type, but belonged to the MOBQ1 group based on relaxase sequences, and appeared to be mobilizable, but not self-transmissible. Considering the time periods of bacterial isolation, it would appear the blaGES-5 plasmid has persisted in an environmental niche for at least 2 years in the hospital.

It is unclear which populations are at high risk for the emergence of these strains. METHODS: All unique patient isolates of S. aureus were collected from hospitals in Brooklyn, NY over a three-month period. Isolates of MRSA that were susceptible to clindamycin underwent SCCmec typing. Isolates with the SCCmec type IV (characteristic of CA-MRSA strains) underwent ribotyping. Demographic information involving the neighborhoods of Brooklyn was also gathered and correlated with the prevalence of CA-MRSA strains. RESULTS: Of 1316 isolates collected during the surveillance, 217 were MRSA susceptible to clindamycin. A total of 125 isolates possessed SCCmec type IV; 72 belonged to the USA300 strain and five belonged to the USA400 strain. Hospitals in the eastern part of the city had the highest prevalence of USA300 strain. Individuals in the eastern region, when compared to the western region, were more likely to be Black, Hispanic, female, and {\textless} 18 years of age, and to have households of {\textgreater} or = 3 persons. In addition, the median household income was lower, and the proportion of individuals on public assistance was higher, for the population in the eastern region. CONCLUSION: The USA300 strain of CA-MRSA is emerging in New York City.

2951,maybe,calfee2012a,article,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterocci (VRE) are the two most common healthcare-associated multidrug-resistant organisms. The purpose of this article is to review recent data regarding the epidemiology, control and treatment of these organisms as well as to discuss the emergence of additional antimicrobial resistance determinants. RECENT FINDINGS: Although the prevalence of methicillin resistance continues to increase among healthcare-associated S. aureus isolates, the incidence of invasive MRSA infections appears to be decreasing. Reduced susceptibility to vancomycin among MRSA isolates has been associated with glycopeptide treatment failure. Resistance to newer antimicrobial agents, such as daptomycin and linezolid, has been described among isolates of MRSA and VRE, further complicating treatment of infections caused by these organisms. Recent studies that have attempted to assess the efficacy of a variety of strategies for the prevention of MRSA and/or VRE transmission and infection, including active surveillance testing, have been published and additional studies are currently underway. SUMMARY: MRSA and VRE remain important causes of morbidity and mortality among patients receiving healthcare. The emergence of resistance to additional antimicrobial agents highlights the importance of effective prevention programs. Further study to determine the optimal approaches to treatment and prevention is needed.",D P Calfee,0951-7375,Curr Opin Infect Dis,"*Vancomycin Resistance/physiology,Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use,Cost of Illness,Cross Infection/prevention {\&} control,Enterococcus/*drug effects,Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections/*epidemiology/p,Humans,Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus/*drug,Prevalence,Staphylococcal Infections/epidemiology/prevention",385--394,"{Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and other Gram-positives in healthcare}",NA,25,2012,4,"1473-6527

We report MRSA sepsis in a 16-year-old male from a small town and who had no history of exposure to healthcare or recent travel. After trauma during a soccer match, he presented swelling in the right thigh, which evolved in a month to cellulitis complicated by local abscess, orchitis and pneumonia. The patient presented severe sepsis, with fever and respiratory failure. Laboratory findings included blood leukocyte counts above 40,000/mm(3) and thrombocytopenia. He was submitted to mechanical ventilation and therapy with vancomycin and imipenem. He had a slow but favorable response to therapy and was discharged after six weeks of hospitalization. MRSA grew from blood cultures and respiratory aspirates obtained before antimicrobial therapy. The isolate belonged to sequence type 5, spa type t311, harbored SCCmec type IV and genes for Panton-Valentine leukocidin and Enterotoxin A. The pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pattern was distinct from North American classic CA-MRSA clones.

3034,yes,caneiras2012,article,"Objectives: Nowadays the carbapenems resistance among Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae are serious therapeutic and infection control challenge. The aim of this study was to analyse the clinical characteristics and to investigate the genetic basis of the carbapenem resistance of K. pneumoniae and A. baumannii clinical strains isolated from the same patient. Methods: Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by disk diffusion (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefotaxime, cefoxitine, ceftazidime, imipenem, meropenem, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, tigecycline and colistin), and interpreted according to CLSI guidelines. The presence of blaTEM, blaSHV, blaCTX, blaKPC, blaIMP and blaVIM was screened by PCR using specific primers. Amplicons were sequenced and compared to sequences available in the GeneBank database. Results: A female patient, with 35 years old, had renal insufficiency, being an immunocompromised host. She had been submitted to ciprofloxacin and meropenem therapy before the identification, in February 2011, of KPC-3 producing Klebsiella pneumoniae. Acinetobacter baumannii 86982FF was isolated in March 2011. Both isolates were recovered from sputum at surgical ward. K. pneumoniae showed susceptibility to colistin, intermediate susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin, and resistance to the other antimicrobials, including tigecycline. A. baumannii was resistant to all studied antimicrobials and was identified a KPC-3 carbapenemase. The blaKPC-3 gene was part of a plasmid in both isolates and was included in transposon Tn4401. Conclusions: We report for the first time the identification of multidrugresistant A. baumannii producing KPC-3 carbapenemase in Portugal. The report of KPC-3-producing A. baumannii isolates is very worrisome, since these strains are resistant to all beta-lactam agents and to other antimicrobials, including colistin and tigecycline.",C Caneiras and F Calisto and G {Da Silva} and T Amores and L Lito and J {Melo Cristino} and A Duarte,1198-743x,Clinical Microbiology and Infection,"Acinetobacter baumannii,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Portugal,acid,antibiotic sensitivity,antiinfective agent,beta lactam,carbapenem,carbapenem derivative,carbapenemase,cefotaxime,ceftazidime,ciprofloxacin,colistin,data base,disk diffusion,female,gene,gentamicin,human,imipenem,immunocompromised patient,infection,infection control,kidney failure,meropenem,microbiology,patient,plasmid,sputum,surgical ward,therapy,tigecycline,transposon",302,{First identification of colistin and tigecycline-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii producing KPC-3 carbapenemase in Portugal},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l70822935 http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-0691.2012.03802.x http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=1198743x{\&}id=doi:10.1111{\%}2fj.1469-0691.2012.03802.x{\&}atitle=f,18,2012,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,yes,cale,yes,erica,erica,zach_3,no,zm_3.csv,could not get full-text access through emory,NA,NA,no,journal
3100,maybe,carbonne2010,article,"An outbreak of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae type 2 was detected in September 2009 in two hospitals in a suburb south of Paris, France. In total, 13 KPC-producing K. pneumoniae type 2 cases (four with infections and nine with digestive-tract colonisations) were identified, including a source case transferred from a Greek hospital. Of the 13 cases, seven were secondary cases associated with use of a contaminated duodenoscope used to examine the source case (attack rate: 41{\%}) and five were secondary cases associated with patient-to-patient transmission in hospital. All isolated strains from the 13 patients: (i) exhibited resistance to all antibiotics except gentamicin and colistin, (ii) were more resistant to ertapenem (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) always greater than 4 mg/L) than to imipenem (MIC: 1-8 mg/L, depending on the isolate), (iii) carried the blaKPC-2 and blaSHV12 genes and (iv) had an indistinguishable pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern. These cases occurred in three hospitals: some were transferred to four other hospitals. Extended infection control measures implemented in the seven hospitals included: (i) limiting transfer of cases and contact patients to other wards, (ii) cohorting separately cases and contact patients, (iii) reinforcing hand hygiene and contact precautions and (iv) systematic screening of contact patients. Overall, 341 contact patients were screened. A year after the outbreak, no additional case has been identified in these seven hospitals.

3434,maybe,chandwani2014,article,"Rationale: Isolation of subpopulations of Staphylococcus aureus with the small-colony variant (SCV) phenotype has become essential among CF patients. S. aureus can persist in the airways of people with CF for years and can develop a hyper-mutator phenotype and may undergo adaptive changes, including SCVs, to survive within the unique environment of the CF airway Methods: Sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage and respiratory specimens received by the microbiology laboratories at New York University Langone Medical Center (NYULMC) were evaluated using cystic fibrosis (CF) work up protocol (CFWU). As of 10/15/2013 this protocol included identification of S. aureus presenting as tiny pinpoint colonies (as small as 1/10 the size of the predominant S. aureus morphotype) on Columbia colistin and nalidixic (CNA) agar. Comparative morphology on chocolate and mannitol salt agar plates was used for initial confirmation. Results: Microbiologic analysis of specimens from 98 cystic fibrosis patients during January 1, 2013 to May 7, 2014 period was performed by using CFWU protocol. During the 16 month period, 79 patients were cultured. Median age of CF patients was 17 years and 57{\%} were males. A total of 772 isolates were recovered, 36{\%} of these isolates were positive for Staphylococcus aureus (n=277). Using a cefoxitin screen and oxacillin susceptibility testing (Biomerieux Vitek 2; AST-GP67 {\&} GP75) 43{\%} of Staphylococcus aureus isolates were found methicillin resistant (n=158). Among initial isolates of Staphylococcus aureus high level resistance was noted for macrolide, clindamycin, levofloxacin and gentamicin (69{\%}, 57{\%}, 30{\%} and 12{\%}, respectively). The resistance for macrolide, clindamycin, levofloxacin, and gentamicin increased for subsequent isolates (71 {\%}, 68{\%}, 39{\%} and 13{\%}, respectively). Although 100{\%} of initial isolates were susceptible to vancomycin and linezolid, 6 subsequent isolates showed resistance to linezolid. Between October 15, 2013 to May 7, 2014, SCV culture testing was performed for 48 patients. None of the isolates yielded small colony variants. Conclusion: Prevalent Staphylococcus aureus strains at NYULMC CF center have acquired multiple drug resistance. Although increasing prevalence of MRSA and fluoroquinolone resistance is known, emergence of linezolid resistance is highly concerning.

4017,yes,clarke2013,article,"Group C Streptococcus (GCS) is a rare cause of bacteremia in humans. It is mostly associated with zoonological infections. Although GCS can be part of the normal oral, skin, and genitourinary flora, an infection with this pathogen can be highly virulent, causing rapid, disseminating disease. With a mortality of about 25{\%}, the poor prognosis is linked to the severity of illness and the high level of virulence of the organism. Only a few cases of GCS meningitis have been reported. We present the first case of GCS meningitis with cavernous sinus thrombosis. {\textcopyright} 2013 Clarke et al.

Only a single previous case of pneumonia, pericarditis, and meningitis has been reported. Case Description: We recently encountered a patient with brain abscess from which S acidominimus was isolated after initially being recorded as S viridans. Because 49{\%} of all S viridans isolated from abscesses are resistant to $\beta$-lactam antimicrobials, speciation is important as well as in vitro sensitivity testing. Streptococcus acidominimus is ordinarily sensitive to $\beta$-lactams, and the use of ceftriaxone for 6 weeks successfully resulted in cure of the brain abscess. Conclusion: The use of speciation in treatment of S viridans should improve clinical outcomes. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

These four isolates were negative for the 23S rRNA mutations, but positive for the gene cfr. Mutations in the gene for the ribosomal protein L3, which resulted in the amino acid exchanges Gly152Asp and Tyr158Phe, were identified in S. haemolyticus 09D279 and S. cohnii NDM113, respectively. In each isolate, the cfr gene was located on a plasmid of ca. 35.4 kb, as shown by S1 nuclease pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and Southern blotting experiments. This plasmid was indistinguishable from the previously described plasmid pSS-02 by its size, restriction pattern, and a sequenced 14-kb cfr-carrying segment. Plasmid pSS-02 was originally identified in staphylococci isolated from pigs. This is the first time that a cfr-carrying plasmid has been detected in MRCoNS obtained from intensive care patients in China. Based on the similarities to the cfr-carrying plasmid pSS-02 from porcine coagulase-negative staphylococci, a transmission of this cfr-carrying plasmid between staphylococci from pigs and humans appears to be likely.",L Cui and Y Wang and Y Li and T He and S Schwarz and Y Ding and J Shen and Y Lv,1932-6203,PLoS ONE,"Acetamides/pharmacology,Bacterial Proteins/*genetics/metabolism,Coagulase/*deficiency,Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial/*genetics,Gene Order,Humans,Linezolid,Methicillin Resistance/genetics,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Molecular Typing,Mutation,Oxazolidinones/pharmacology,Plasmids/genetics,Staphylococcal Infections/microbiology,Staphylococcus haemolyticus/drug effects/genetics,Staphylococcus/drug effects/*genetics",e57096,{Cfr-mediated linezolid-resistance among methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci from infections of humans},NA,8,2013,2,"1932-6203

4489,maybe,curiao2010,article,"BACKGROUND: KPC carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates have been increasingly detected in Europe. We report the first KPC-producing isolates characterized in Madrid, Spain. METHODS: Twelve K. pneumoniae isolates recovered from clinical and surveillance cultures from eight patients (September 2009 to February 2010) that were resistant to carbapenems and resulted in a positive modified Hodge test, were screened for carbapenemase genes (PCR, sequencing and hybridization). Clonal relatedness was established by PFGE and multilocus sequence typing. Plasmid characterization included incompatibility group assay and XhoI/HindIII restriction pattern comparison. The genetic environment was characterized by PCR based on the Tn4401 sequence. RESULTS: All 12 isolates were resistant to all beta-lactams, including imipenem and meropenem (MIC {\textgreater}or= 8 mg/L). Eleven of them, fully susceptible to aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones, showed related PFGE patterns and belonged to sequence type (ST) 384 and harboured the bla(KPC-3), bla(OKP-5), bla(OXA-9) and bla(TEM-1) genes, whereas one isolate resistant to quinolones belonged to ST388, and also harboured the bla(CTX-M-10) gene. The bla(KPC-3), bla(OXA-9) and bla(TEM-1) genes were located on an approximately 85 kb non-transferable plasmid that was a derivative of pKPN3/pKPN4 previously described in K. pneumoniae. The bla(KPC-3) gene was located on the Tn4401 'isoform a' variant, which is usually linked to bla(KPC-2), but rarely to bla(KPC-3). CONCLUSIONS: The emergence of Tn4401-bla(KPC-3) within a pKPN3/4-like plasmid and its novel association with ST384 and ST388 K. pneumoniae clones in Spain is reported. Although bla(KPC-3) has been scarcely reported in Europe, the location of this Tn4401a in a widespread K. pneumoniae plasmid supports the possibility of broader future dissemination.",T Curiao and M I Morosini and P Ruiz-Garbajosa and A Robustillo and F Baquero and T M Coque and R Canton,0305-7453,J Antimicrob Chemother,"*DNA Transposable Elements,Adolescent,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology,Bacterial Proteins/*biosynthesis,Carbapenems/pharmacology,DNA, Bacterial/chemistry/genetics,Female,Humans,Klebsiella Infections/*microbiology,Klebsiella pneumoniae/classification/*drug effects,Male,Middle Aged,Nucleic Acid Hybridization,Plasmids/classification/*isolation {\&} purification,Polymerase Chain Reaction,Restriction Mapping,Sequence Analysis, DNA,Spain,beta-Lactam Resistance,beta-Lactamases/*biosynthesis,purification",1608--1614,{Emergence of bla KPC-3-Tn4401a associated with a pKPN3/4-like plasmid within ST384 and ST388 Klebsiella pneumoniae clones in Spain},NA,65,2010,8,"1460-2091

It has rarely been identified as a human pathogen. We report a case of S intermedius pneumonia in a woman with cystic fibrosis. She presented with submassive hemoptysis, which evolved into respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome, ultimately requiring mechanical ventilation. Initial empiric therapy with vancomycin was inadequate; linezolid and ceftaroline were substituted. Improvement was observed; she recovered and was discharged with a temporary tracheostomy. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of community-acquired pneumonia due to S intermedius occurring in cystic fibrosis.

5812,yes,elhani2014,article,"Twenty-eight vancomycin (VA)-resistant enterococci isolated from different patients (n = 16) and also from the environment (n = 12) were recovered in a Tunisian military hospital during 2012-2013. The mechanisms of resistance to VA and to other antibiotics as well as the presence of esp and hyl virulence genes were determined in these isolates by PCR, being their clonal relationship analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). VA resistance mechanisms detected were as follows (species-patient/environment): vanA (Enterococcus faecium, 13/5), vanC1 (Enterococcus gallinarum, 3/0), and vanC2 (Enterococcus casseliflavus, 0/7). Most of the VA-resistant enterococci presented a multiresistance phenotype and harbored different resistance genes (erm(B), tet(M), tet(L), ant(6)-Ia, aac(6')- aph(2{""}), aph(3')-IIIa, and catA). The PFGE revealed the presence of 3 clones (A, B, C) and 1 closely related pattern (A1) among the 13 vanA-containing E. faecium isolates of patients showing 11 of them the A-A1 patterns. The clone A was also detected in all 5 environmental vanA-containing E. faecium isolates. Strains did not contain esp or hyl virulence genes. Multilocus sequence typing was performed in 4 E. faecium isolates representative of the 4 detected pulsotypes (A, A1, B, and C), and 2 different sequence types were identified (ST18 and ST80), both of them included in clonal complex CC17. These strains contained the IS16 element and showed ampicillin and ciprofloxacin resistance.

5824,maybe,eljammal2012,article,"Background Bacterial meningitis caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) is rare, occurring primarily in patients who have undergone neurosurgical procedures, but it has also been described in the absence of intracranial instrumentation in leukemic bone marrow transplant (BMT) patients with central line-associated enterococcal blood stream infections. We report a fatal case of VRE meningitis in a solid organ transplant patient. Case A 42 year-old man with a past medical history of type 1 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease requiring kidney-pancreas transplantation in 2005 was admitted to the intensive care unit with fever, abdominal pain, and hypotension. He had resumed hemodialysis one year prior due to graft failure from medication non-compliance. He was found to be in diabetic ketoacidosis, for which he was placed on intravenous insulin drip at an outside hospital and then transferred to our institution. Laboratory studies showed renal failure, metabolic acidosis with increased anion gap, and elevated amylase and lipase. Computed tomography imaging of his abdomen showed an edematous pancreas transplant with areas of necrosis in his right pelvis. Blood and urine cultures grew VRE, for which he was started on linezolid. His necrotic pancreas was surgically debrided, and tissue cultures grew VRE. After appropriate source control and antibiotics, his sepsis resolved. Three days later, he developed new grand mal seizures, and CSF cultures grew VRE. Although his fever and leukocytosis improved, his neurologic status did not improve due to insults from his prior hypotensive episodes, prompting his family to withdraw care. Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the first case of a non-BMT, non-intracranial instrumented sepsis patient who developed VRE meningitis in a medical intensive care unit. Although hematologic seeding of the central nervous system with VRE is rare, it is possible in immunosuppressed patients. The difficulty in treating VRE meningitis involves both drug kinetics and microbial resistance factors. Although quinupristin/dalfopristin, daptomycin and teicoplanin have been used with mixed success, linezolid has been reported to be a useful option for treating VRE meningitis, achieving sufficient CSF concentrations.",S Eljammal and A Balekian,1073-449x,American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,"American,R factor,abdomen,abdominal pain,acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis,amylase,anion gap,antibiotic agent,antihypertensive agent,bacterial meningitis,blood,bloodstream infection,bone marrow transplantation,central nervous system,central venous catheter,cerebrospinal fluid,cerebrospinal fluid culture,computer assisted tomography,dalfopristin plus quinupristin,daptomycin,devices,diabetic ketoacidosis,drug therapy,end stage renal disease,fatality,fever,graft failure,hemodialysis,hospital,human,hypertension,hypotension,imaging,insulin,insulin dependent diabetes mellitus,intensive care unit,kidney failure,kidney pancreas transplantation,laboratory,leukocytosis,linezolid,male,medical history,meningitis,metabolic acidosis,necrosis,neurosurgery,pancreas,pancreas transplantation,patient,pelvis,pharmacokinetics,sepsis,society,solid,teicoplanin,tissue culture,tonic clonic seizure,transplantation,triacylglycerol lipase,urine culture,vancomycin resistant Enterococcus",NA,{A case of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus meningitis complicating necrotizing pancreatitis},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l71989233 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=1073449x{\&}id=doi:{\&}atitle=a+case+of+vancomycin-resistant+enterococcus+meningitis+complicating+necrotizing+pancre,185,2012,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,maybe,cale,no,mushtaq,ayomide,zach_3,no,zm_3.csv,could not get full-text access through emory,NA,NA,no,journal

6257,maybe,feng2015,article,"OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to characterize the molecular mechanism of coproduction of KPC-2 and NDM-1 in Citrobacter freundii. METHODS: C. freundii strain 112298 was isolated from a human case of septic shock in a Chinese teaching hospital. The major carbapenemase and ESBL genes were detected by PCR. The MIC values were determined by using VITEK 2 and antimicrobial susceptibility was judged by CLSI standards. The resistance plasmid was transferred into Escherichia coli by electroporation, followed by plasmid DNA isolation from the electroporant, and then fully sequenced and compared with closely related plasmids. RESULTS: Strain 112298 produces KPC-2 and NDM-1, encoded by the novel non-typeable plasmid p112298-KPC and an IncX3-type plasmid p112298-NDM, respectively. In p112298-KPC, a Tn1722-based blaKPC-2-carrying transposon is associated with several additional resistance modules, constituting a single MDR region. Assembly of these resistance modules is likely mediated by homologous recombination between five copies of IS26 elements at different sites within the MDR region. p112298-NDM is a very close relation of pNDM-HN380. blaNDM-1 in p112298-NDM is carried by a Tn125 variant, which differs from the prototype Tn125 as observed in pNDM-BJ01 by disruption of an upstream copy of ISAba125 by IS5 and absence of a downstream copy of ISAba125. CONCLUSIONS: Production of KPC-2 and NDM-1 by p112298-KPC and p112298-NDM, respectively, makes C. freundii 112298 highly resistant to carbapenems and, moreover, these two plasmids still harbour genes for resistance to cephalosporins, chloramphenicol, chromate, fosfomycin, quaternary ammonium, rifampicin and sulphonamides.",J Feng and Y Qiu and Z Yin and W Chen and H Yang and W Yang and J Wang and Y Gao and D Zhou,0305-7453,J Antimicrob Chemother,"China,Citrobacter freundii/drug effects/*enzymology/*gen,Conjugation, Genetic,Enterobacteriaceae Infections/*microbiology,Escherichia coli/genetics,Gene Transfer, Horizontal,Hospitals,Humans,Male,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Middle Aged,Plasmids/*analysis,Polymerase Chain Reaction,Shock, Septic/microbiology,beta-Lactamases/*genetics/secretion",2987--2991,{Coexistence of a novel KPC-2-encoding MDR plasmid and an NDM-1-encoding pNDM-HN380-like plasmid in a clinical isolate of Citrobacter freundii},NA,70,2015,11,"1460-2091

6362,maybe,feuerriegel2012,article,"BACKGROUND: Drug resistance displays a problem for the therapy of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections. For molecular resistance testing, it is essential to have precise knowledge on genomic variations involved in resistance development. However, data from high-incidence settings are only sparely available. Therefore we performed a systematic approach and analyzed a total of 97 M. tuberculosis strains from previously treated patients in Sierra Leone for mutations in katG, rpoB, rrs, rpsL, gidB, embB, pncA and where applicable in inhA and ahpC. Of the strains investigated 50 were either mono- or poly-resistant to isoniazid, rifampin, streptomycin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide or MDR and 47 fully susceptible strains served as controls. RESULTS: The majority of isoniazid and rifampin resistant strains had mutations in katG315 (71.9{\%}) and rpoB531 (50{\%}). However, rpoB mutations in codons 511, 516 and 533 were also detected in five rifampin susceptible strains. MIC determinations revealed low-level rifampin resistance for those strains. Thus, the sensitivity and specificity of sequencing of katG for detection of drug resistance were 86.7{\%} and 100{\%} and for sequencing of rpoB 100{\%} and 93.8{\%}, respectively.Strikingly, none of the streptomycin resistant strains had mutations in rrs, but 47.5{\%} harboured mutations in rpsL. Further changes were detected in gidB. Among ethambutol resistant strains 46.7{\%} had mutations at embB306. Pyrazinamide resistant strains displayed a variety of mutations throughout pncA. The specificities of sequencing of rpsL, embB and pncA for resistance detection were high (96-100{\%}), whereas sensitivities were lower (48.8{\%}, 73.3{\%}, 70{\%}). CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals a good correlation between data from molecular and phenotypic resistance testing in this high-incidence setting. However, the fact that particular mutations in rpoB are not linked to high-level resistance is challenging and demonstrates that careful interpretation of molecular resistance assays is mandatory. In addition, certain variations, especially in gidB, appear to be phylogenetically informative polymorphisms rather than markers for drug resistance.",S Feuerriegel and B Oberhauser and A G George and F Dafae and E Richter and S Rusch-Gerdes and S Niemann,1471-2180,BMC Microbiol,"*Drug Resistance, Bacterial,Antitubercular Agents/*pharmacology,Bacterial Proteins/genetics,DNA, Bacterial/chemistry/genetics,Genotype,Humans,Incidence,Microbial Sensitivity Tests/methods,Mycobacterium tuberculosis/*drug effects/*genetics,Sensitivity and Specificity,Sequence Analysis, DNA/*methods,Sierra Leone/epidemiology,Tuberculosis/epidemiology/*microbiology",90,{Sequence analysis for detection of first-line drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains from a high-incidence setting},NA,12,2012,NA,"1471-2180

ST80 was dominant in Europe and has increasingly been described from the Middle East. Herewe report the whole genome sequence of the first ST80 CA-MRSA from the USA. Methods: CA-MRSA isolate S0924 was obtained from a patient admitted to Cook County Hospital (Chicago, IL, USA) who came from Syria; the isolate belonged to spa type t044 and ST80. The whole genome sequence of S0924 was determined and compared with three previously published whole genome sequences of ST80 CA-MRSA from Europe and a newly sequenced ST80 CA-MRSA from the Netherlands (S1475). Results: Based on spa typing, SCCmec type and virulence gene profile, this US ST80 isolate is indistinguishable from the European CA-MRSA ST80 clone. SNP analysis within the conserved core genome showed clear differences between the strains with up to 144 SNPs differing between S0924 and strain S1800, an ST80 MRSA from Greece. The gene content showed 21 regions of difference between the US and European isolates, although these were largely restricted to mobile genetic elements. Phylogenetic reconstruction indicated that the European strains were more closely related to each other than to the US strain. The SNP data suggest that a common ancestor existed around two decades ago, indicating that the US and European ST80 strains are clonally linked. Conclusions: These data combined with the country of origin of the patient suggest that ST80 S0924 was probably relatively recently introduced into the USA from Syria.",A C Fluit and N Carpaij and E A M Majoor and R A Weinstein and A Aroutcheva and T W Rice and M J M Bonten and R J L Willems,"1460-2091

6712,maybe,frigo2011,article,"Background: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a major concern worldwide. AMR surveillance globally is crucial for guiding effective treatment and accordingly for public health purposes. In the former Soviet countries, the knowledge regarding AMR has been limited. However, in 2004 the Russian gonococcal antimicrobial susceptibility programme (RU-GASP), which now acts also under WHO protocols, was initiated. The aims of the present study were to examine and describe the prevalence of N gonorrhoeae AMR in 2010 in Russia, and reveal trends during 2005-2010. Methods: In 2010, N gonorrhoeae isolates (one isolate per patient; n=407) collected from 46 surveillance sites distributed in all eight Federal Districts of Russia were examined regarding their susceptibility to ceftriaxone, spectinomycin, azithromycin, penicillin G, ciprofloxacin, and tetracycline using agar dilution method, according to CLSI and WHO protocols. $\beta$-Lactamase production was identified using nitrocefin discs. Results: In 2010, the AMR (intermediate susceptibility) levels were as follows - ceftriaxone 0{\%} (0{\%}), spectinomycin 4.4{\%} (12.3{\%}), azithromycin 4.9{\%} (10.4{\%}), penicillin G 32.5{\%} (39.9{\%}), ciprofloxacin 53.2{\%} (3.0{\%}), and tetracycline 41.9{\%} (26.6{\%}). Three isolates (0.7{\%}) were resistant to all antimicrobials except ceftriaxone. During 2005-2010, the AMR has remained high to penicillin G, tetracycline, and ciprofloxacin. The proportion of resistant isolates to spectinomycin and azithromycin has ranged from 0{\%} (2005) to 7.2{\%} (2008), and 0.4{\%} (2008) to 4.9{\%} (2010), respectively. All isolates in 2005-2010 were susceptible to ceftriaxone. Nevertheless, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) distribution of ceftriaxone has rapidly shifted to higher MICs, and isolates at the breakpoint for intermediate susceptibility/resistance (0.25 mg/l; n=8 [2{\%}] in 2010) have rapidly increased over the years. Conclusions: The AMR of N gonorrhoeae in Russia is high and ceftriaxone (3250 mg) should be first-line for empirical treatment. If there are no access to ceftriaxone or in the presence of severe $\beta$lactam antimicrobial allergy, spectinomycin is recommended for use. However, despite exceedingly rare in most countries spectinomycin resistance is annually identified in Russia, and accordingly the level of this resistance is crucial to monitor.

Since 2000, antimicrobial resistance of H. pylori increased dramatically and evolved to multiresistance particularly to clarithromycin, metronidazole and more recently to fluoroquinolones. We studied 97 isolates of H. pylori collected from gastric biopsies of patients from Paris and Poitiers. These strains were all resistant to ciprofloxacin. The MIC was determined using the agar dilution reference method (breakpoint 1 mg/L). The QRDR of gyrA gene was sequenced for all the strains. Among the 97 studied isolates, 94 harbored at least one mutation already described in the QRDR region of gyrA (T87I n = 23, N87K n = 32, D91N n = 30, D91G n = 7, D91Y n = 6), two harbored a mutation never previously described (D91H and A88P).

7010,yes,garrido2007,article,"BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori is a pathogenic bacterium that infects a half of the human population. In Chile, between 55{\%} and 79{\%} of people are colonized by H. pylori. At present, therapeutic strategies to eradicate the bacterium depend on the knowledge of its resistance to antibiotics. The clarithromycin resistance in H. pylori is associated with point mutations in the 23S rRNA. This study analyzes 23S rRNA gene mutations and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for clarithromycin in H. pylori isolates from patients of the metropolitan region of Chile. MATERIALS AND METHODS: H. pylori isolates from 50 dyspeptic patients with no history of clarithromycin exposure were tested for clarithromycin resistance by agar dilution method. Resistant strains were analyzed for mutations in the 23S rRNA gene by polymerase chain reaction-based restriction fragment length polymorphism and sequencing. RESULTS: Primary resistance was observed in 10 isolates (20{\%}). A single mutation was detected in four of the 10 isolates and two or more mutations in the other six cases. The C2147G transversion and G1939A, T1942C, and A2142G transitions in the peptidyltransferase region of domain V were novel. CONCLUSIONS: The study shows: 1, novel variants of the H. pylori 23S rRNA gene; and 2, a high prevalence of H. pylori displaying primary clarithromycin resistance with low level of MIC in an urban area of the Metropolitan Region of Chile.",L Garrido and H Toledo,"1083-4389 (print)

The aim of this study was to characterize biofilm formation, antibiotic resistance, SCCmec type, and genetic relatedness in clinical isolates of Staphylococcus cohnii, Staphylococcus hominis, and Staphylococcus sciuri recovered from humans. Methods: Clinically relevant isolates of S. cohnii (n = 15), S. hominis (n = 9), and S. sciuri (n = 6), were collected from patients. Biofilm formation was evaluated using crystal violet staining, drug susceptibility was assessed using the broth microdilution method, and methicillin resistance was measured using the cefoxitin disk test. SCCmec was typed using 2 different methodologies, and genetic relatedness was determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Results: Sixty percent (9/15) of S. cohnii, 33{\%} (3/9) of S. hominis, and 50{\%} (3/6) of S. sciuri isolates were categorized as weak producers of biofilm. None of the isolates were resistant to vancomycin or linezolid. All 3 species showed a high resistance ({\textgreater} 66{\%}) to ampicillin, levofloxacin, erythromycin, and ceftriaxone, and the majority of the isolates were methicillin-resistant. PFGE revealed that the S. cohnii isolates comprised 1 dominant clone. Conclusions: The S. cohnii, S. hominis, and S. sciuri isolates analyzed in this study showed a high methicillin resistance and resistance to other antimicrobials. The results of this study strongly suggest that coagulase-negative staphylococci harbour new SCCmec elements.

7156,maybe,george2015,article,"LEARNING OBJECTIVE {\#}1: Diagnosing Daptomycin nonsusceptible vancomycin resistant enterococcus faecium. LEARNING OBJECTIVE {\#}2: Identify risk factors for the development daptomycin nonsusceptible vancomycin resistant enterococcus. CASE: A 76-year-old male with history of coronary artery disease and chronic kidney disease stage IIIB developed abdominal pain for 7 days prior to presenting to the emergency room. The patient was afebrile with laboratory studies significant for a WBC of 13.6 thousand/cumm, troponin of 0.04 ng/m, and GFR of 49 mL/min, which was similar to the patient's baseline renal function. Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast revealed a colon mass in proximal transverse colon near the area of the hepatic flexure. Blood cultures drawn 12 h apart revealed vancomycin resistant enterococcus (VRE) faecium. This particular isolate had a non-susceptibility Etest to daptomycin with a mean inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 12 $\mu$g/mL, with sensitivity to linezolid. Colonoscopy revealed an ulcerated non-obstructing large mass in the proximal transverse colon which was biopsied. Pathology was negative for any malignancy but revealed acute necro-inflammatory debris and lamina propria hemorrhage. Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) revealed small vegetations on the anterior mitral valve leaflet. The patient was treated successfully with intravenous linezolid and gentamicin for a total of 8 weeks with repeat TEE showing resolution of the previously seen vegetation. DISCUSSION: The first case of VRE endocarditis that met the Duke Criteria was reported in 1996. Native valve endocarditis secondary to enterococci account for 14-17 {\%} of cases among patients over the age of 60. Enterococci are considered to be susceptible if the MIC is less than 4 $\mu$g/mL and have intermediate resistance once the MIC are between 8 and 16 $\mu$g/mL. VRE colonization has been shown to have a higher incidence amongst renal transplant and hemodiayslsis patients. There are limited case reports of enterococci faecium causing endocarditis. We report a rare case of daptomycin nonsusceptable vancomycin resistant enterococcus faecium (DNS-VRE) causing endocarditis in a patient with an underlying benign colon mass. It was believed that the source of the isolate was the ulcerated colon mass. The reported patient fulfilled the modified Duke Criteria for endocarditis with 2 major criteria (ie positive blood cultures for enterococci and mitral valve vegetation). DNS-VRE is an extremely rare isolate, however several risk factors for DNSVRE isolation have been suggested via retrospective analysis including immunosuppression, duration of hospitalization, indwelling devices thought to foster biofilm formation on prosethetic devices, and previous daptomycin exposure. Pfaller MA et al. 2005 found only 0.6 {\%} (10/1560) of isolates among VRE species were DNS-VRE. At the present time, little is known about the emergence or the incidence of DNSE isolates. Kelesidis T et al. 2011 report that less than 2 {\%} of enterococci isolates were daptomycin nonsusceptible with MIC of â¥4 $\mu$g/mL. The rising reports of DNS-VRE is concerning. We report a case in which the MIC was found to be 12 $\mu$g/mL suggesting that this isolate was truly DNS-VRE. Daptomycin is the only antibiotic with in vitro bactericidal activity against VRE that has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Based on susceptibility breakpoints approved by the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute, daptomycin has in vitro activity against {\textgreater}90{\%} of enterococcal isolates. Dohmen PM et al. 2012 outlines daptomycin for the treatment of infective endocarditis through one of the largest trials involving infective endocarditis and suggests that â¥8 mg/kg dosing of daptomycin has a higher clinical success rate (90 {\%}) compared to standard dosing (4 mg/kg). At the current time there exists no recommendations from the Infectious Disease Society of America regarding treatment for DNS-VRE infections. Further studies are needed to clarify the mechanism of development of resistance among patient with VRE, and what dose of daptomycin would most be effective in patients found to have DNS-VRE infections.",N George and J Suri,0884-8734,Journal of General Internal Medicine,"Enterococcus,Enterococcus faecium,Western Hemisphere,abdomen,abdominal pain,antibiotic agent,bacterial endocarditis,bactericidal activity,biofilm,bleeding,blood culture,case report,chronic kidney disease,clinical laboratory,colonoscopy,computer assisted tomography,coronary artery disease,daptomycin,devices,echocardiography,emergency ward,endocarditis,epsilometer test,exposure,food and drug administration,gentamicin,hospitalization,human,immunosuppressive treatment,in vitro study,infection,inhibitory concentration,internal medicine,kidney function,kidney graft,laboratory,lamina propria,linezolid,male,minimum inhibitory concentration,mitral valve,pathology,patient,pelvis,risk factor,society,species,transverse colon,troponin,vancomycin resistant Enterococcus,vegetation",s347--s348,{A rare isolate: Daptomycin nonsusceptible vancomycin resistant enterococcus faecium causing endocarditis},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l71878125 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=08848734{\&}id=doi:{\&}atitle=a+rare+isolate{\%}3a+daptomycin+nonsusceptible+vancomycin+resistant+enterococcus+faecium+,30,2015,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,yes,brooke,no,ayomide,zach,zach_3,no,zm_3.csv,could not find full-text,NA,NA,no,journal

Shigella was isolated from their cultured sample from the year 2002-2008. In this study, the total of 121 registered Shigella collected from 2002-2008 were analyzed. There were 62 cases of S. sonnei, 46 cases of S. flexneri, eight cases of S. boydii and five cases of S. dysenteriae among them. Furthermore, two cases of Shigella sonnei were collected from the blood and the rest from the watery stools of the infected patients.

Historically, Acinetobacter spp. have been associated with opportunistic infections that were rare and of modest severity; the last two decades have seen an increase in both the incidence and seriousness of A. baumannii infection, with the main targets being patients in intensive-care units. Although this organism appears to have a predilection for the most vulnerable patients, community-acquired A. baumannii infection is an increasing cause for concern. The increase in A. baumannii infections has paralleled the alarming development of resistance it has demonstrated. The persistence of this organism in healthcare facilities, its inherent hardiness and its resistance to antibiotics results in it being a formidable emerging pathogen.

7586,yes,gottig2011,article,"Objectives: We report an outbreak of Klebsiella pneumoniae with carbapenem resistance or decreased susceptibility in seven patients at the University Hospital of Frankfurt in 2010. Molecular and phenotypical investigations of the clinical isolates were performed. Methods: Antibiotic susceptibilites of K. pneumoniae were determined by Vitek2 and E-test. DNA from K. pneumoniae were screened by PCR for the presence of KPC, VIM, IMP, NDM-1 and Oxa-48 $\beta$-lactamases. Transferability of Oxa-48 was tested by transformation of plasmid DNA into E. coli. Results: Ertapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae were isolated from rectal swabs and urine samples from seven patients during an outbreak. Of these seven patients, two were only colonized, three exhibited urinary tract infections and two patients were severely ill suffering from sepsis and/or pneumonia due to ertapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae. Infected patients were successfully treated with high dose meropenem and gentamicin, and, in case of pneumonia, in addition with inhalative colistin. All K. pneumoniae were resistant to penicillins, cephalosporins, ertapenem and fluoroquinolones. Some of the strains exhibited elevated MICs towards meropenem, doripenem or imipenem, but still remained susceptible. Oxa-48 was identified by PCR and sequencing in all K. pneumoniae isolates from the seven patients. In one of these patients an Oxa-48 producing Escherichia coli was isolated from rectal swabs in addition to the Oxa-48 producing K. pneumoniae. In vitro transfer of Oxa- 48 containing plasmid DNA from K. pneumoniae and E. coli into highly susceptible E. coli resulted in resistance against penicillins, cephalosporins and ertapenem. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an outbreak of Oxa-48 producing K. pneumoniae in Germany. Epidemiological, molecular and phenotypical data suggest a horizontal interspecies transfer of Oxa-48 containing plasmid in vivo.",S GÃ¶ttig and V A Kempf and T A Wichelhaus,1198-743x,Clinical Microbiology and Infection,"DNA,Escherichia coli,Germany,Klebsiella pneumoniae,antibiotic agent,carbapenem,carbapenem derivative,cephalosporin derivative,colistin,doripenem,drug megadose,epsilometer test,ertapenem,gentamicin,human,imipenem,in vitro study,inosine phosphate,meropenem,patient,penicillin derivative,plasmid,plasmid DNA,pneumonia,quinolone derivative,sepsis,university hospital,urinalysis,urinary tract infection",s170,{In vivo transfer of OXA-48 during an outbreak of Klebsiella pneumoniae with decreased susceptibility to carbapenems},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l70599416 http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-0691.2011.03558.x http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=1198743x{\&}id=doi:10.1111{\%}2fj.1469-0691.2011.03558.x{\&}atitle=i,17,2011,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,yes,brooke,yes,erica,erica,zach_3,no,zm_3.csv,could not find full-text,NA,NA,no,journal

Integrons as genetic reservoirs play major roles in dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report carriage of class 1 and 2 integrons and associated gene cassettes in H. pylori isolates from Iran. This crosssectional study was conducted in Tehran among 110 patients with H. pylori infection. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) for H. pylori strains were assessed by the micro broth dilution method. Class 1 and 2 integrons were detected using PCR. In order to determine gene cassettes, amplified fragments were subjected to DNA sequencing of both amplicon strands. The prevalence of resistance to clarithromycin, metronidazole, clarithromycin, tetracycline, amoxicillin, rifampin, and levofloxacin were 68.2{\%} (n=75), 25.5{\%} (n=28), 24.5{\%} (n=27), 19.1{\%} (n=21), 18.2{\%} (n=20) and 16.4{\%} (n=18), respectively. Frequency of multidrug resistance among H. pylori isolates was 12.7{\%}. Class 2 integron was detected in 50 (45.5{\%}) and class 1 integron in 10 (9.1{\%}) H. pylori isolates. The most predominant gene cassette arrays in class 2 integron bearing H. pylori were included sateraaadA1, dfrA1sat2aadA1, blaoxa2 and, aadB whereas common gene cassette arrays in class 1 integron were aadBaadA1cmlA6, aacA4, blaoxa2, and catB3. The high frequency of class 2 integron and multidrug resistance in the present study should be considered as a warning for clinicians that continuous surveillance is necessary to prevent the further spread of resistant isolates.",M Goudarzi and S S Seyedjavadi and M Fazeli and M Roshani and M Azad and M Heidary and M Navidinia and H Goudarzi,"1513-7368 (print)

Methods: From October 2012 to March 2015, meropenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae were detected in 45 samples from seven patients at Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark. In silico resistance genes, Inc plasmid types and STs (MLST) were obtained from WGS data from 24 meropenem-resistant isolates (13 C. freundii, 6 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 4 Escherichia coli and 1 Klebsiella oxytoca) and 1 meropenem-susceptible K. oxytoca. The sequences of the meropenem-resistant C. freundii isolates were compared by phylogenetic analyses. In vitro susceptibility to 21 antimicrobial agents was tested. Furthermore, in vitro conjugation and plasmid characterization was performed. Results: From the seven patients, 13 highly clonal ST18 NDM-1-producing C. freundii were isolated. The ST18 NDM-1-producing C. freundii isolates were only susceptible to tetracycline, tigecycline, colistin and fosfomycin (except for the C. freundii isolates from Patient 2 and Patient 7, which were additionally resistant to tetracycline). The E. coli and K. pneumoniae from different patients belonged to different STs, indicating in vivo transfer of blaNDM-1 in the individual patients. This was further supported by in vitro conjugation and detection of a 154 kb IncA/C2 plasmid with blaNDM-1. Patient screenings failed to reveal any additional cases. None of the patients had a history of recent travel abroad and the source of the blaNDM-1 plasmid was unknown.

Both isolates were positive for blaNDM-1 and were attributed with the sequence type 85. One isolate was from a Syrian refugee, whereas the second was from a patient who had never travelled outside Turkey. Our findings confirmed that the rapid spread of NDM-1-producing Gram-negative organisms could become a major challenge for the treatment and control of healthcare-associated infections in our geographical area.

8610,maybe,hidron2009,article,"Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), usually known as a nosocomial pathogen, has emerged as the predominant cause of skin and soft-tissue infections in many communities. Concurrent with the emergence of community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA), there have been increasing numbers of reports of community-acquired necrotising pneumonia in young patients and others without the classic health-care-associated risk factors. Community-onset necrotising pneumonia due to CA-MRSA is now recognised as an emerging clinical entity with distinctive clinical features and substantial morbidity and mortality. A viral prodrome (eg, influenza or influenza-like illness) followed by acute onset of shortness of breath, sepsis, and haemoptysis is the most frequent clinical presentation.

The MRSA (strain NN47) belonged to multilocus sequence type (ST) 8 and exhibited spa363 (t024), agr1, staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) type IVa, and coagulase type III. It was positive for Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) and the arginine catabolic mobile element (ACME). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) demonstrated that the MRSA was the USA300 clone, which is the predominant community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) in the US. Strain NN47 was divergent, in terms of the spa type and patterns of PFGE and plasmids, from the USA300-0114 type strain or USA300 strain NN36, previously isolated from a visitor (Indian girl) from the US. Strain NN47 was resistant to erythromycin, in addition to $\beta$-lactam agents (e.g., oxacillin). These data demonstrate the first emergence of the USA300 clone in Japanese children who have never been abroad and have had no contact with foreigners (and therefore, the first USA300 spread in Japan), and also emergence of multiple divergent strains of the USA300 clone in Japan. Because the USA300 clone is highly transmissible and virulent, surveillance of the USA300 clone is needed. {\textcopyright} 2010 Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and The Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases.",W Higuchi and S Mimura and Y Kurosawa and T Takano and Y Iwao and S Yabe and O Razvina and A Nishiyama and Y Ikeda-Dantsuji and F Sakai and H Hanaki and T Yamamoto,1341-321x,J Infect Chemother,",Anti-Bacterial Agents,Bacteremia/microbiology,Bacterial,Bacterial Toxins/genetics,Cellulitis/microbiology,Communicable Diseases,Community-Acquired Infections/*microbiology,Drug Resistance,Electrophoresis,Emerging/microbiology,Exotoxins/genetics,Female,Gel,Humans,Infant,Japan,Japanese (people),Leukocidins/genetics,Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus/geneti,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Panton Valentine leukocidin,Pulsed-Field,Staphylococcal Infections/*microbiology,Thigh/microbiology,United States,Virulence Factors/genetics,antibiotic resistance,article,bacterial strain,bacterial transmission,bacterial virulence,bacterium detection,bacterium isolation,beta lactam,blood culture,case report,cefazolin,cellulitis,child,clinical feature,communicable disease,erythromycin,female,fever,heat sensation,human,linezolid,methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus,methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus infect,minimum inhibitory concentration,multilocus sequence typing,nucleotide sequence,osteomyelitis,oxacillin,phenotype,pulsed field gel electrophoresis,purification/pathogenicity,recurrent disease,teicoplanin,vancomycin",292--297,"{Emergence of the community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus USA300 clone in a Japanese child, demonstrating multiple divergent strains in Japan}",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l50842897 http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10156-010-0051-y http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=1341321x{\&}id=doi:10.1007{\%}2fs10156-010-0051-y{\&}atitle=emergence+of+th,16,2010,4,"from duplicate 1 (emergence of the community-acquired methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus usa300 clone in a japanese child, demonstrating multiple divergent strains in japan - higuchi, w; mimura, s; kurosawa, y; takano, t; iwao, y; yabe, s; razvina, o; nishiyama, a; ikeda-dantsuji, y; sakai, f; hanaki, h; yamamoto, t)

8679,yes,hishinuma2013,article,"Since the first report of New Delhimetallo-beta-lactamase 1 (NDM-1) in 2009, it spread worldwide in Europe, America, Africa, Asia, and Australia. The first case was a Swedish patient who had previously been treated in India. Recently, blaNDM-1-producing bacteria were identified from environment in New Delhi and Vietnam. Also, the blaNDM-1 gene was found on a mobile plasmid in an Acinetobacter lwoffii isolate fromchicken meat. We reported the first case of NDM-1 producing Escherichia coli in Japan from a patient who had been treated in India in 2009. Subsequently, we determined complete sequence of the blaNDM-1- positive plasmid (pNDM-1-Dok01) of IncA/C which suggested a possible origin fromplant pathogens such as Pseudoxanthomonas and Xanthomonas spp. We report another NDM-1 plasmid in Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from the second Japanese patient who locally acquired the blaNDM-1 producing organism in Japan. From September 15, 2010 to December 28, 2010, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of the Japanese government conducted nation-wide surveillance of multi-drug resistant Enterobacteriaceae, which showed resistance to three classes of antibiotics, carbapenems, fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides. From a woman over ninety years old who resided in a nursing home, multi-drug resistant K. pneumoniae (NDM-1- Saitama) was isolated from urine and subsequent PCR analysis revealed the blaNDM-1 gene. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) indicated that the strain NDM-1-Saitama belonged to sequence type ST42 which had not been reported previously. Complete sequencing and gap closing by PCR demonstrated a 49,441bp IncFII plasmid which bears 53 genes. The plasmid pNDM-1- Saitama consists of 22kb backbone and 27kb multi-drug resistant region. Half of the backbone showed 100{\%} perfect match of the sequence of K. pneumoniae plasmid pKP048which contains blaKPC-2. The second half of the backbone has only partial similarity to the plasmids with blaNDM-1 and blaCTX-M3. The multi-drug resistant region of pNDM-1-Saitama contains 13 drug resistant elements including blaNDM-1, bleMBL, blaDHA-1, sul1, armA, mel, and mph2. The complete sequence of an ISAba125 insertion sequence in the upstream of the blaNDM-1 gene suggests horizontal transfer of the blaNDM-1 gene between Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter . The possible recombination events between NDM-1 plasmids and plasmids carrying KPC and CTXM-3 or A. baumannii genome are suggested. The blaNDM-1 gene is always followed by the bleomycin resistant protein gene bleMBL. The blaNDM-1- bleMBL elements are followed either by blaDHA-1 and ampR or molecular chaperones groES and groER.

This organism is usually isolated from wastewater and is closely related to D. acidovorans (formerly Comamonas acidovorans ). To date, there is only one report describing D. tsuruhatensis as the causative agent of a human infection in 2011. Although class 3 integron was reported in one D. tsuruhatensis strain, the functions of associated gene cassettes werenot demonstrated.We present the genetic context of integron carrying bla IMP-1 gene in D. tsuruhatensis isolated from clinical specimen. Methods: Delftia species (CRS1243) was isolated from the peritoneal fluid of a stomach cancer patient and was considered as a colonizer. The bacterial identification and susceptibility testswere performed by the Vitek 2 GN and AST-N212. Species was identified using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The production of carbapenemase was screened with modified Hodge test. To determine the types of carbapenemase, we used a combination test of carbapenem and b-lactamase inhibitor disks. The multiplex PCR was performed for detection of NDM, SIM, GIM, VIM, SPM, and IMP enzymes encoding genes. The genetic context of integron carrying bla IMP-1 genewas derived fromprimerwalking. To determine the location of integron, we performed plasmid extraction and conjugation. Results: The isolated strain was identified as D. acidovorans with a probability level of 99{\%} by Vitek 2, but confirmed as D. tsuruhatensis by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The isolate was suspected as a metallo-b-lactamase producer by modified Hodge and carbapenemase inhibition tests. The bla IMP-1 gene was detected by PCR and sequencing. The isolatewas non-susceptible to amikacin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, cefotaxime, cefepime, imipenem, and colistin, but susceptible to aztreonam, minocycline, tigecycline, and cotrimoxazole. The carbapenem resistance was not transferred to Escherichia coli J53 (azide R). D. tsuruhatensis CRS1243 harbored bla IMP-1 gene in class 1 integron located on Tn402 -like transposon. Between the 5'-conserved segment and the tni module, the gene cassettes were orfE, aac(6')-31-like, orfE, orfE, aac(6')-II , aacA7, bla IMP-1, aacA7 aac(6')-II and qacE2 .

8905,maybe,hososaka2007,article,"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has been defined as S. aureus having the mecA gene or showing a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of oxacillin higher than 4 mg/l. However, some clinical isolates are mecA-positive and oxacillin-susceptible. Therefore, we surveyed the occurrence of S. aureus having the mecA gene and an MIC of oxacillin of less than 2 mg/l (oxacillin-susceptible MRSA; OS-MRSA) in a total of 480 strains of S. aureus collected from 11 hospitals in different location in Japan isolated from 2003 through 2005. We found 6 strains matching the criteria for OS-MRSA. All 6 strains were staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCC) mec-positive, without exception, and 4 strains showed the SCCmec type III-variant, which is unique in Japan. These OS-MRSAs were least resistant to oxacillin among the MRSAs tested and they were within the susceptible range to seven other beta-lactam antibiotics tested. Thus, OS-MRSA may become a high-resistant MRSA upon the treatment of patients with beta-lactam antibiotics. To characterize whether these OS-MRSAs were hospital-acquired or community-acquired MRSAs, we tested for the presence of the genes encoding toxins. Genes encoding hemolysin, exfoliative toxin, enterotoxin, toxic shock syndrome toxin-1, and Panton-Valentine leukocidin were found in 6, 4, 0, 0, and 0 strains, respectively. These results revealed that OS-MRSAs could be classified as a new type of MRSA that exhibits properties distinguishable from either hospital- or community-acquired MRSA. Coagulase typing of the OS-MRSAs supported the above conclusion. In this study, the occurrence of OS-MRSA at a certain frequency was noted; precautions are called for in the classification of oxacillin-resistant S. aureus and in the treatment of OS-MRSA infection.",Y Hososaka and H Hanaki and H Endo and Y Suzuki and Z Nagasawa and Y Otsuka and T Nakae and K Sunakawa,"1341-321x (print)

Due to the resistance of those bacteria to almost all antibiotics (e.g.beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones),treatment options are seriously limited. In the Czech Republic, the incidence of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae seems to be low, restricted to only three cases detected between 2009 and 2010.Here, we describe molecular typing of 15 carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates identified in the Czech Republic during 2011. Five VIM-1-producing isolates belonging to sequence type (ST)11 and one VIM-4-producing isolate of ST1029 have been detected. blaVIM-1 and blaVIM-4 as a part of class 1 integrons were chromosomally located or carried by a plasmid belonging to A/C replicon type (blaVIM-4). KPC-3-producing isolates of ST512, recovered from six patients, caused an outbreak. Three more isolates producing KPC-2 enzyme belonged to ST258. Both blaKPCgenes were part of the Tn4401a transposon carried on plasmids of the pKpQIL type.

9339,maybe,irfan2008,article,"BACKGROUND: This study was conducted to evaluate drug resistance amongst bacteremic isolates of febrile neutropenic patients with particular emphasis on emergence of carbapenem resistant Gram negative bacteria and vancomycin resistant Enterococcus species. METHODS: A descriptive study was performed by reviewing the blood culture reports from febrile neutropenic patients during the two study periods i.e., 1999-00 and 2001-06. Blood cultures were performed using BACTEC 9240 automated system. Isolates were identified and antibiotic sensitivities were done using standard microbiological procedures. RESULTS: Seven twenty six febrile neutropenic patients were admitted during the study period. A total of 5840 blood cultures were received, off these 1048 (18{\%}) were culture positive. Amongst these, 557 (53{\%}) grew Gram positive bacteria, 442 (42{\%}) grew Gram negative bacteria, 43 (4{\%}) fungi and 6 (1{\%}) anaerobes. Sixty (5.7{\%}) out of 1048 positive blood cultures were polymicrobial. In the Gram negative bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae was the predominant group; E. coli was the most frequently isolated organism in both study periods. Amongst non- Enterobacteriaceae group, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the commonest organism isolated during first study period followed by Acinetobacter spp. However, during the second period Acinetobacter species was the most frequent pathogen. Enterobacteriaceae group showed higher statistically significant resistance in the second study period against ceftriaxone, quinolone and piperacillin/tazobactam, whilst no resistance observed against imipenem/meropenem. The susceptibility pattern of Acinetobacter species shifted from sensitive to highly resistant one with significant p values against ceftriaxone, quinolone, piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem/meropenem. Amongst Gram positive bacteria, MRSA isolation rate remained static, vancomycin resistant Enterococcus species emerged in second study period while no Staphylococcus species resistant to vancomycin was noted. CONCLUSION: This rising trend of highly resistant organisms stresses the increasing importance of continuous surveillance system and stewardship of antibiotics as strategies in the overall management of patients with febrile neutropenia.",S Irfan and F Idrees and V Mehraj and F Habib and S Adil and R Hasan,1471-2334,BMC Infect Dis,"Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology,Bacteremia/complications/drug therapy/*microbiolog,Carbapenems/pharmacology,Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial,Enterobacteriaceae/drug effects/isolation {\&} purifi,Fever/complications/drug therapy/microbiology,Gram-Negative Bacteria/*drug effects/isolation {\&} p,Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections/drug therapy/*m,Gram-Positive Bacteria/*drug effects/isolation {\&} p,Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections/drug therapy/*m,Humans,Neutropenia/complications/microbiology,Pakistan,Vancomycin Resistance",80,{Emergence of Carbapenem resistant Gram negative and vancomycin resistant Gram positive organisms in bacteremic isolates of febrile neutropenic patients: a descriptive study},NA,8,2008,NA,"1471-2334

Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of QRNG isolated in year 2002 were performed, and clinical information was collected. QRNG was first noted in 1999 and its proportion increased to 42{\%} in 2002. MICs of the 12 isolates tested in 2002 showed a high level of resistance to ofloxacin with MIC of more than 4 microg/mL. Clinical information from patients with QRNG showed treatment failure. Emergence of QRNG in developing countries is alarming as there is no proper surveillance of increase in resistance.

Eleven OXA-48 carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates were recovered from patients treated in nine different hospitals in Kuwait. Susceptibility testing to eighteen antibiotics was done using the E-test. PCR assays were performed for the detection of genes encoding extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) (blaCTX-M, blaSHV, and blaTEM) and carbapenemases (blaOXA-48, blaVIM, blaNDM, blaIMP, blaGIM, and blaKPC). STs were determined by Multilocus Sequence Typing. Seven Klebsiella pneumoniae, two Escherichia coli, one Enterobacter cloacae, and one Morganella morganii harbored the blaOXA-48 gene. The K. pneumoniae and E. coli belonged to seven and two different STs, respectively, which were not related to those reported from this region. The majority of the isolates carried either blaCTX-M or blaSHV genes and showed a multidrug-resistant phenotype, including resistance to tigecycline.

9766,yes,johansson2015,article,"Objectives: Two strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, B and J-2, have been isolated from sputa of Swedish cystic fibrosis patients and were identified as the most frequent genotypes. Their pathogenic potential differs distinctly: while strain J-2 is highly transmissible and multi-resistant, strain B is not. The aim of the present work is to investigate the proteome to reveal differences between these two strains. Methods: We employed a comparative proteomic approach involving twodimensional gel electrophoresis coupled to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry with isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) to map the proteomes of B and J-2 and to identify differentially expressed proteins. Results: We identified 1873 proteins and quantified 1769 proteins of which about 21{\%} were differentially expressed at statistically significant altered abundance between the two analysed strains. Functional analysis of the different abundant proteins showed they could be clustered into five major groups i. secreted factors; ii. cell wall/LPS/capsule; iii. chemotaxis; iv. motility {\&} attachment; v. adaption/protection. Within the functional clusters, upregulated proteins (q{\textless}0.05) involved in virulence were more common in strain J-2 than strain B, 17{\%} respectively 6{\%} of the total number of upregulated proteins. Conclusion: This work provides the first overview of P. aeruginosa strains J-2 and B on proteome changes occurring during adaptation to the CF lung and/or antibiotic treatments.

These isolates were from seven immunocompromised patients and from environmental swabs. ESBLs inhibited by clavulanic acid were detected by double-disk diffusion tests. Isoelectric focusing revealed that these isolates produced two to four beta-lactamases with pIs of 5.5, 6.1, 6.4, 7.6 or 8.2, and PCR detected the presence of bla(OXA-18), bla(SHV) and bla(TEM) genes in 24, 21 and two isolates, respectively. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis defined two dominant genotypic groups: group A (16 isolates) and group B (four isolates). Sequencing of PCR products from representative isolates identified the bla(OXA-18) gene and revealed nucleotide sequences belonging to the bla(SHV-1) and bla(TEM-1) genes. Isolates producing OXA-18 belonged to genomic group A and were isolated from four immunocompromised patients in the haematology and graft units, and from two wash-basins in the graft unit.

10142,yes,karaaslan2016,article,"Background: Multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli are responsible for more than 50{\%} of healthcare-associated infections. Colonization dynamics, characteristics, and risk factor data for CR-GNB are scarce in children. Aim: To examine the molecular characteristics of, and risk factors for nosocomial colonization with, carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacilli (CR-GNB) in hospitalized paediatric patients in a tertiary university hospital's paediatric units in Turkey. Methods: A prospective case-control study was performed at a university hospital in Istanbul, Turkey. Findings: A total of 1840 rectal swab specimens were collected from all 762 hospitalized children between March 2013 and October 2013. Among them, 176 (23{\%}) patients were colonized with CR-GNB. Of these, 72 (9{\%}) patients were colonized with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, 138 (18{\%}) with CR-non-fermenter Gram-negative bacilli (CR-NF) and 34 (4{\%}) with both. The median CR-GNB colonization time was 10 days (range: 1-116). The median duration of rectal colonization with CR-GNB was 8 days (range: 1-160). NDM (31{\%}) was the second most frequent carbapenemase identified in Acinetobacter baumannii isolates, and has not previously been detected in Turkey. All of the 17 patients colonized with NDM-producing A. baumannii were newborns in the neonatal intensive care unit. Independent risk factors for CR-GNB colonization were: age {\textless}1 year, nasogastric tube placement, presence of underlying chronic diseases, ampicillin usage, surgical intervention, and carbapenem use. Conclusion: This is the first description of NDM in A. baumannii in newborn units in Turkey. Carbapenem usage is a common independent risk factor for both CRE and CR-NF colonization, which underscores the importance of antibiotic stewardship programmes.",A Karaaslan and A Soysal and G {Altinkanat Gelmez} and E {Kepenekli Kadayifci} and G SÃ¶yletir and M Bakir and G Soyletir and M Bakir,"1532-2939

No detailed examinations and no molecular investigations of Treponema pallidum strains transmitted in the Tuva Republic, or in general, in Russia, were published internationally. We examined the syphilis epidemiology in 1994-2013, and the molecular epidemiology and macrolide resistance in T. pallidum strains in 2013-2014 in the Tuva Republic. Among 95 mainly primary or secondary syphilis patients, the arp, tpr, tp0548 and 23S rRNA genes in 85 polA gene-positive genital ulcer specimens were characterized. The syphilis incidence in Tuva Republic peaked in 1998 (1562), however declined to 177 in 2013. Among the 70 (82{\%}) completely genotyped specimens, six molecular strain types were found. Strain type 14d/f accounted for 91{\%}, but also 14c/f, 14d/g, 14b/f, 14i/f, 9d/f, and 4d/f were identified. Two (2.4{\%}) specimens contained the 23S rRNA A2058G macrolide resistance mutation.

11079,yes,kozodoy2015,article,"Introduction: Nocardia is a group of modified acid fast filamentous branching bacilli that are characteristically gram positive. Although Nocardia species normally exist as soil saprophytes, they have increasingly been isolated as infectious agents in immunocompromised and immunocompetant patients. Infections range from focal pulmonary nocardiosis to widespread disseminated disease. Case presentation: A 23-year-old African American female was admitted to our hospital with progressively worsening shortness of breath accompanied by productive non-bloody cough with anterior neck mass. Past medical history was remarkable for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), lupus nephritis, ESRD on hemodialysis secondary to SLE, and history of ischemic stroke. She was on prednisone 20 mg daily and azathioprine 50 mg daily. On admission her temperature was 98.6Â°C with 91{\%} oxygen saturation on ambient air. Her physical exam was remarkable for fluctuant anterior neck mass and dullness to percussion in left lower lobe with decreased bronchial breath sounds as well as focal rhonchi in the same area. Laboratory analysis yielded a white blood cell count of 23.5x103/L (90{\%} neutrophils, 4{\%} lymphocytes, no bands). Blood cultures were negative. Chest CT revealed multiple new large basilar left pleural-based loculated effusions. CT of neck revealed left large homogeneous soft tissue mass and CT head revealed multiple ring-enhancing lesions at grey-white matter interface of cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres. She underwent CT guided drainage of the neck abscess and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) with Nocardia species isolated from AFB cultures. Ribosomal RNA gene sequencing (16S rRNA) was done with subsequent identification of Nocardia otitidiscaviarum. This strain of nocardia was trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) resistant. A year-long therapy with TMP/SMX, amikacin and meropenem was initiated. Follow up evaluation showed clinical and radiographic improvement of disseminated nocardia infection after 2 months. Discussion: Although Nocardia species are a rare cause of infection, its mortality rate (31{\%}) is considerably greater than that of other agents that can cause abscesses ({\textless}10{\%}). Accurate diagnosis and early treatment are challenging especially in light of recent alarming reports of increased in vitro sulfonamide resistance. Our species of nocardia was one of those isolates found to be sulfonamide-resistant. TMP-SMX remains a first-line drug for treating focal or disseminated nocardiosis; the degree of dissemination and immunocompromised status of host patient will dictate antibiotic combination.

NDM-1 is also associated with resistance to many other classes of antibiotics. The enzyme was first identified in organisms isolated from a patient in Sweden who had previously received medical treatment in India, but it is now recognized as endemic throughout India and Pakistan and has spread worldwide. The gene encoding NDM-1 has been found predominantly in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. We describe the isolation NDM-1-producing organisms from two patients in Toronto, Ontario. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an organism producing NDM-1 that was locally acquired in Canada. We also discuss the evidence that NDM-1 can affect bacterial species other than E. coli and K. pneumoniae, the limited options for treatment and the difficulty laboratories face in detecting organisms that produce NDM-1. {\textcopyright} 2011 Canadian Medical Association or its licensors.",J V Kus and M Tadros and A Simor and D E Low and A J McGeer and B M Willey and C Larocque and K Pike and I A Edwards and H Dedier and R Melano and D A Boyd and M R Mulvey and L Louie and C Okeahialam and M Bayley and C Whitehead and D Richardson and L Carr and F Jinnah and S M Poutanen,"0820-3946

11382,yes,lafeuille2013,article,"Six multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were recovered from injured Libyan combatants. Production of carbapenemase was screened by using commercial combination tablets from Rosco combined with a temocillin disk. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing were used to detect several carbapenemase genes and to characterize their genetic environment. Genetic support was studied by mating-out assays. Plasmid size was identified by the KADO method. PCR and sequencing allowed characterization of plasmid scaffold. Genotyping was performed by pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing. PCR was used to check for the presence of nine genes linked to virulence in K. pneumoniae. No carbapenemase was identified by Rosco disks, but all isolates showed high-level temocillin resistance. All of them harbored blaOXA-48 in the transposon Tn1999.2, on a self-conjugative plasmid of about 60 kb, similar to pOXA-48. PFGE revealed three clusters in which isolates were genetically related: The first comprised FM9 and FM10, and the second comprised FM1, FM4, and FM5. FM2 formed a third distinct clone. Sequence types ST101, ST11, and ST147 were identified in keeping with PFGE results. The entB, ycfM, ybtS, and mrkD genes were detected in all isolates, and kfu gene was present in the three ST101 strains. This work confirms the current and successful spread of blaOXA-48 by horizontal dissemination of a single IncL/M plasmid through different genetic backbones with strong epidemic potential. It also highlights the need for rapid and reliable phenotypic detection methods.

11730,maybe,lee2006a,article,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to characterize the genetic basis of beta-lactam resistance developed in clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae after exposure to cefuroxime. METHODS: Clinical features of two episodes of liver abscess caused by K. pneumoniae in a diabetic patient were reported. Four isolates (KP(1)/KP(2) and KP(3)/KP(4)) of K. pneumoniae were recovered from cultures of blood/pus in the first and second episodes, respectively. Laboratory investigation of the K. pneumoniae isolates included genotyping by PFGE, resistance gene analysis by PCR amplification and DNA sequencing, and outer membrane protein analysis by SDS-PAGE. RESULTS: KP(3) and KP(4) were recovered after a 21 day cefuroxime therapy and demonstrated identical genotypes to that of KP(1) and KP(2). However, compared with KP(1) and KP(2), emerging resistance to piperacillin, cefalotin, cefuroxime and cefoxitin was observed. The other antibiotics tested, except ampicillin, retained the same effectiveness against the four isolates, although increases (4- to 8-fold) in the MICs of cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cefepime, flomoxef and aztreonam were observed in KP(3) and KP(4). None of the isolates produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases or plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases. Deficiency in the expression of an outer membrane protein (OmpK35) was observed in the cefuroxime-resistant isolates, KP(3) and KP(4). CONCLUSIONS: The increased resistance to cephalosporins in these clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae after exposure to cefuroxime might be related to the loss of OmpK35.",C H Lee and J H Chia and C Chu and T L Wu and J W Liu and L H Su,"0305-7453

11983,yes,lewis2013,article,"OBJECTIVES: To describe the phenotypic and genetic characteristics of the first two cases of extended-spectrum cephalosporin (ESC)-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae in South Africa, one of which was associated with verified cefixime treatment failure. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two ESC-resistant N. gonorrhoeae isolates were cultured from the urethral discharge of two men who have sex with men (MSM). One man reported a persistent urethral discharge that had failed to respond to previous therapy with oral cefixime. Agar dilution MICs were determined for eight antibiotics. beta-Lactam-associated resistance mutations were identified through PCR-based amplification and sequencing for several key genes: penA, mtrR and its promoter, porB1b (penB), ponA and pilQ. For molecular epidemiological characterization, full-length porB gene sequencing, N. gonorrhoeae multiantigen sequence typing (NG-MAST) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) were performed. RESULTS: Both isolates were resistant to cefixime, ciprofloxacin, penicillin and tetracycline and intermediate/resistant to azithromycin, but susceptible to ceftriaxone, gentamicin and spectinomycin. Both isolates had the type XXXIV penA mosaic allele in addition to previously described resistance mutations in the mtrR promoter (A deletion), porB1b (penB) (G101K and A102N) and ponA1 (L421P). Both isolates had an identical NG-MAST sequence type (ST4822) and MLST sequence type (ST1901). CONCLUSIONS: Both isolates were resistant to cefixime and possessed a number of identical mutations in key genes contributing to ESC resistance in N. gonorrhoeae. The two isolates contained the type XXXIV penA mosaic allele and belonged to a successful international MSM-linked multidrug-resistant gonococcal clone (MLST ST1901) associated with several cefixime treatment failures in Europe and North America.",D A Lewis and C Sriruttan and E E Muller and D Golparian and L Gumede and D Fick and J {de Wet} and V Maseko and J Coetzee and M Unemo and E E MÃ¼ller and D Golparian and L Gumede and D Fick and J {de Wet} and V Maseko and J Coetzee and M Unemo,"0305-7453

Information regarding TIG-resistant Escherichia coli isolates is scarce. In this study, we report the emergence of high-level TIG resistance in a longitudinal series of XDR E. coli isolates collected during TIG treatment. Whole-genome sequencing was performed for six E. coli strains harbouring bla(NDM-5) and genomic comparison revealed two amino acid substitutions. Mutation in rpsJ could be a significant factor conferring TIG resistance in these isolates. The fitness cost of TIG resistance in resistant strains was evaluated by determining the relative growth rate, indicating that TIG resistance reduced fitness by ca. 7{\%}. This study is the first report to demonstrate high-level TIG resistance in E. coli in vivo. In addition, we report the first treatment-emergent minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) development of TIG from 1mg/L to 64 mg/L in E. coli.

METHODS: porB DNA sequences of 174 N. gonorrhoeae isolates, collected from 143 male patients and 31 female sexual partners in Shanghai were determined. Phylogenetic analysis was used to determine sequence associations and concordance with epidemiologically linked cases. PorB protein sequences were compared with the wild-type sequence to identify mutations associated with antimicrobial resistance to penicillin and tetracycline. RESULTS: porB1a genotypes comprised 27.0{\%} of the isolates and included 15 distinct DNA sequences, while 73.0{\%} of the isolates carried porB1b genotypes with 63 distinct DNA sequences. porB DNA sequence typing was congruent with patient-reported sexual contacts. In addition, porB DNA sequence analysis revealed a number of strains with identical DNA sequences not identified through traditional epidemiological methods. The porB1b isolates had a significantly higher percentage of chromosomally mediated resistance to tetracycline and higher MIC50s to penicillin and ciprofloxacin. G120K/A121D mutations were observed in 71.1{\%} of PIB isolates and were associated with resistance to penicillin and/or tetracycline. The majority of the PIA isolates (82.1{\%}) also carried G120D/A121G double mutations. The index of discrimination for porB DNA sequence analysis was 95{\%}. CONCLUSIONS: The porB1b genotype was found to be predominant in Shanghai. porB DNA sequence typing was sufficiently discriminatory for differentiating N. gonorrhoeae isolates and was congruent with epidemiological linkages.

12277,maybe,liu2013,article,"There have been increasing reports of blaOXA-23-carrying strains of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB), which has become a significant public health concern in Taiwan. To determine the origin of these CRAB strains, the prevalence of CRAB and blaOXA-23-carrying CRAB in a regional hospital was analysed retrospectively. The genome of A. baumannii TYTH-1 was completely sequenced and annotated. Multiple comparative genomics studies, including phylogenetic analysis, functional comparison via the Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COGs) database, and determination of variance in GC profiles in the whole genome and gene arrangements in resistance islands, were performed using 11 completely sequenced A. baumannii genomes. bla OXA-23-carrying CRAB isolates became dominant clones in 2007. A comparative genomics analysis revealed a common strain lineage between Taiwanese strains (TYTH-1 and TCDC-AB0715) and Chinese strains (MDR-TJ and MDR-ZJ06). Phylogenetic studies and GC profiles showed that the genome of TYTH-1 was closest to MDR-ZJ06. However, the resistance island of TYTH-1 (RI TYTH-1) was nearly identical to that of RIMDT-TJ. The functional category for COGs was similar in the tested genomes. The results reveal that dissemination of blaOXA-23-carrying CRAB in Taiwan may have been mediated by the transfer of people between Taiwan and China during 2007. The global spread of CRAB is now a worldwide public health problem. In Taiwan, the government needs to focus more attention on the importance of identifying and tracing resistant pathogens and issuing notifications of CRAB infections. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V. and the International Society of Chemotherapy.",C C Liu and C Y Tang and H Y Kuo and C W Lu and K C Chang and M L Liou,"0924-8579

12646,maybe,luizrdos2013,article,"OBJECTIVES: This study has used a combination of clinical information, spoligotyping, and georeferencing system to elucidate the genetic diversity of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates circulating in a TB-prevalent municipality of Northeast Brazil. METHODS: A total of 115 M. tuberculosis strains were isolated from pulmonary tuberculosis patients from January 2007 to March 2008 in Fortaleza. Drug susceptibility and spoligotyping assays were performed and place of residence of the patients were georeferenced. RESULTS: Of the M. tuberculosis strains studied, 51 (44.3{\%}) isolates were resistant to at least one drug (R-TB) and 64 (55.7{\%}) were sensitive to all the drugs tested (S-TB). A high frequency of resistance was found in previously treated cases (84{\%}) and among new cases (16{\%}; p{\textless}0.001). A total of 74 (64{\%}) isolates were grouped into 22 spoligotyped lineages, while 41 (36{\%}) isolates were identified as new. Among the predominant genotypes, 33{\%} were Latim American Mediterranean (LAM), 12{\%} Haarlem (H), and 5{\%} U. There was no association of geographic distribution of RT-TB patients as compared to the controls and also the geographic location to the spoligotype patterns. The geospatial analysis revealed that 24 (23{\%}) patients (hot spot zones) either shared the same residence or lived in a close neighborhood of a case. Among these concentration zones, the patients lived in the same residence and shared a common genotype pattern and resistance pattern. DISCUSSION: It was observed that the spoligopatterns family distribution was similar to that reported for South America, prevailing the LAM and H lineages. A high rate-case among the resistant TB group occurs as a result of transmitted and acquired resistance. A more effective surveillance program is needed in order to succeed in reducing tuberculosis in Northeast Brazil.",S {Luiz Rdos} and P Suffys and E C Barroso and L R F S Kerr and C R Duarte and M V C Freitas and R M S Mota and C C Frota and R S S Luiz and P Suffys and E C Barroso and L R F S Kerr and C R Duarte and M V C Freitas and R M S Mota and C C Frota,1413-8670,Brazilian Journal of Infectious Diseases,",*Genetic Variation,80 and over,Adult,Aged,Antitubercular Agents/pharmacology,Bacterial/genetics,Brazil,Brazil/epidemiology,Case-Control Studies,DNA,DNA extraction,Female,Genotype,Geographic Information Systems,Humans,Male,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Middle Aged,Mycobacterium tuberculosis,Mycobacterium tuberculosis/*drug effects/*genetics,Prevalence,Prospective Studies,Pulmonary/epidemiology/*microbiology,Tuberculosis,Young Adult,adolescent,adult,antibiotic resistance,antibiotic sensitivity,article,bacterial load,bacterial strain,bacterium identification,case control study,concentration (parameters),controlled study,drug resistant tuberculosis,drug sensitivity,ethambutol,female,genetic line,genetic variability,genotype,geographic information system,geographic origin,georeferencing system,human,isoniazid,lung tuberculosis,male,medical information,nonhuman,prevalence,prospective study,rifampicin,spoligotyping,sputum examination,streptomycin",338--345,"{Genotyping and drug resistance patterns of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains observed in a tuberculosis high-burden municipality in Northeast, Brazil}",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l52545759 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bjid.2012.10.019 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=14138670{\&}id=doi:10.1016{\%}2fj.bjid.2012.10.019{\&}atitle=genotyping+an,17,2013,3,"from duplicate 2 (genotyping and drug resistance patterns of mycobacterium tuberculosis strains observed in a tuberculosis high-burden municipality in northeast, brazil - luiz rdos, s; suffys, p; barroso, e c; kerr, l r; duarte, c r; freitas, m v; mota, r m; frota, c c)

This represented a dramatic increase in ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae compared to previous years. To investigate the epidemiology and to characterize the resistance mechanisms of the isolates, a study was initiated. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by means of the Etest and the disc diffusion method. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production was identified by clavulanic acid synergy test and confirmed with PCR amplification followed by DNA sequencing. DNA profiles of the isolates were examined with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). All isolates were resistant or exhibited reduced susceptibility to cefadroxil, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, piperacillin/tazobactam, ciprofloxacin, tobramycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. They produced ESBL of the CTX-M-15 type, and the involvement of a single K. pneumoniae clone was shown. This is the first major clonal outbreak of multiresistant ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae in Scandinavia. The outbreak demonstrates the epidemic potential of enterobacteria containing ESBLs of the CTX-M type, even in a country with a relatively low selective pressure and a low prevalence of multiresistant bacteria.",B Lytsy and L Sandegren and E Tano and E Torell and D I Andersson and A Melhus,"0903-4641 (print)

Antimicrobial susceptibility, SCCmec type, spa type and the presence of Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) genes were determined for all HA-MRSA isolates in an Iranian referral hospital. In this study of 48 HA-MRSA isolates, 13 (27{\%}), three (6.2{\%}), five (10.4{\%}) and one (2{\%}) belonged to SCCmec subtypes IVa, IVb, IVc and IVd, respectively. Only two isolates (4.2{\%}) belonged to SCCmec types V Notably, one isolate was found to harbour concurrent SCCmec subtypes IVb and IVd. MRSA containing SCCmec subtype IVb, IVc and IVd as well as type V isolates were all susceptible to chloramphenicol, clindamycin and rifampicin, while the sensitivity to these antibiotics was lower among MRSA containing SCCmec subtype IVa. The most frequently observed spa ttype was t037, accounting for 88{\%} (22/25). Three other spa type was t002, t1816 and t4478.

13129,maybe,marcano2008,article,"BACKGROUND: VIM-type metallo-betalactamases (MBLs) exhibit hydrolytic activity against most betalactam antibiotics, including carbapenems. So far, VIM-type-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates had not been reported in Latin America. METHODOLOGY: In July 2005, a carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae was isolated from a urine sample collected from a 7-year-old girl hospitalized at the Hospital de Ni{\~{n}}os {""}J. M. de los R{\'{i}}os{""} in Caracas, Venezuela. This strain was identified using conventional biochemical tests. The susceptibility analysis was conducted by disk diffusion, and MICs for Imipenem and Meropenem were performed by agar dilution. For the phenotypic detection of MBL we used the Imipenem-EDTA/SMA double-disk diffusion method. The hydrolytic activity against carbapenems was determined by the Masuda microbiological method. Purified protein was subjected to isoelectric focusing (IEF). Detection of antimicrobial resistance genes was performed by PCR amplification with specific VIM primers. RESULTS: The strain showed resistance to most betalactam antibiotics, quinolones and amynoglicosides, but remained susceptible to Aztreonam and Cefepime. The use of phenotypic and microbiological methods detected the presence of a metallobetalactamase. By IEF we visualized three bands at pI 5.4, 7.6 and 7.9, corresponding to reduced-spectrum betalactamases, and a band at pI 5.8 that corresponded to the metallobetalactamase. PCR screening of bla genes revealed the presence of blaVIM, with an amplicon of 261 bp. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of a MBL-mediated carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae in Latin America, which constitutes a public health concern in our region since their transference to other microorganisms with multiple antibiotic resistance mechanisms will increase the antimicrobial resistance problem.",D Marcano and F PasterÃ¡n and M Rapoport and D Faccone and C Ugarte and N Salgado and D Payares and E Spadola and Y LÃ³pez and G Maggi and M Galas and D SÃ¡nchez and F Pasteran and M Rapoport and D Faccone and C Ugarte and N Salgado and D Payares and E Spadola and Y Lopez and G Maggi and M Galas and D Sanchez,1972-2680,Journal of Infection in Developing Countries,",Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology,Aztreonam/pharmacology,Bacterial,Cephalosporins/pharmacology,Child,Cross Infection/microbiology,Drug Resistance,Female,Humans,Imipenem/pharmacology,Klebsiella Infections/*microbiology,Klebsiella infection,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Klebsiella pneumoniae/drug effects/genetics/*isola,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Multiple,Quinolones/pharmacology,Thienamycins/pharmacology,Urine/microbiology,Venezuela,antibiotic resistance,antiinfective agent,article,aztreonam,beta lactamase,beta-Lactam Resistance,beta-Lactamases/analysis/*biosynthesis/genetics,biosynthesis,case report,cefepime,cephalosporin derivative,child,cross infection,drug effect,female,genetics,human,imipenem,isolation and purification,meropenem,metabolism,microbiological examination,microbiology,multidrug resistance,quinolone derivative,thienamycin derivative,urine",241--244,{First isolation of a VIM-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae from a seven-year-old child in Venezuela},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l355896338 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=19722680{\&}id=doi:{\&}atitle=first+isolation+of+a+vim-producing+klebsiella+pneumoniae+from+a+seven-year-old+child+,2,2008,3,"from duplicate 1 (first isolation of a vim-producing klebsiella pneumoniae from a seven-year-old child in venezuela - marcano, d; pasteran, f; rapoport, m; faccone, d; ugarte, c; salgado, n; payares, d; spadola, e; lopez, y; maggi, g; galas, m; sanchez, d)

We report the first verified treatment failure of gonorrhoea with 2 g of azithromycin (extended-release formulation) in Japan and characteristics of the corresponding N. gonorrhoeae isolates. METHODS: Pre- and post-treatment isolates (n = 4) were investigated by Etest for antimicrobial susceptibility. The isolates were examined for molecular epidemiology by multilocus sequence typing (MLST), N. gonorrhoeae multi-antigen sequence typing (NG-MAST) and multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA), and for the presence of azithromycin resistance determinants (23S rRNA gene mutations, erm genes and mtrR mutations). RESULTS: All isolates were resistant to azithromycin (MIC 4 mg/L) and ciprofloxacin, but remained susceptible to cefixime, ceftriaxone and spectinomycin. All isolates were assigned to MLST ST1901 and NG-MAST ST1407 and three of four isolates possessed MLVA profile 8-3-21-16-1. All isolates contained the previously described C2599T mutation (N. gonorrhoeae numbering) in all four 23S rRNA alleles and the previously described single-nucleotide (A) deletion in the mtrR promoter region. CONCLUSIONS: This verified treatment failure occurred in a patient infected with an MLST ST1901/NG-MAST ST1407 strain of N. gonorrhoeae. While this international strain commonly shows resistance or decreased susceptibility to multiple antimicrobials, including extended-spectrum cephalosporins, the strain reported here remained fully susceptible to the latter antimicrobials. Hence, two subtypes of azithromycin-resistant gonococcal MLST ST1901/NG-MAST ST1407 appear to have evolved and to be circulating in Japan. Azithromycin should not be recommended as a single antimicrobial for first-line empirical treatment of gonorrhoea.",T Morita-Ishihara and M Unemo and K I Furubayashi and T Kawahata and K Shimuta and S I Nakayama and M Ohnishi,"1460-2091

This report describes the results of the Canadian Nosocomial Infection Surveillance Program (CNISP) for carbapenem resistant isolates. Methods: From September 2010 to August 31, 2011, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and A. baumannii isolates were submitted to the National Microbiology Laboratory. A detailed patient questionnaire was administered collecting risk factors and outcome data. PCR was used to identify carbapenemase-producing isolates. Antimicrobial susceptibility was conducted using Vitek2. PFGE was conducted to determine strain relatedness. Results: A total of 141 isolates meeting the definition were identified from 11 different hospital sites. Seventy-eight cases were infections, 32 were colonizations, 19 were unknown, and the remainders were not reported. Of the infections, 35{\%} were urinary tract, 27{\%} were skin/soft tissue, and 10{\%} were from blood. Forty four isolates harboured carbapenemases: Enterobacter spp. (4 KPC); Klebsiella spp. (21 KPC, 8 NDM); E. coli (1 GES, 1 KPC); Serratia spp. (6 KPC, 1 GES); Morganella spp. (1 NDM); A. baumannii (1 OXA-23). Several outbreaks were observed based on PFGE analysis including one KPC in Quebec, and two in Ontario involving NDM and KPC. Previous travel history was linked to 10 cases. Two NDM cases sought medical attention in India and one A. baumannii case was from a military source serving overseas. Conclusion: The number of carbapenemase producing isolates identified is of concern especially in Enterobacteriaceae.

14631,yes,murray2010,article,"BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus aureus infections complicate care of combat-related injuries and can independently result in skin and soft-tissue infections during deployments or training. Community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) strains seem to produce severe disease but retain susceptibility to many oral antimicrobials. This study characterizes 84 MRSA isolates recovered from wound cultures at a combat support hospital in Iraq. METHODS: MRSA strains recovered from December 2007 through March 2009 were analyzed. Antimicrobial resistance testing was determined by broth microdilution and the BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System. The genotypic pattern was analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and polymerase chain reaction identification of resistance and virulence genes. RESULTS: No MRSA isolates from wound cultures were resistant to vancomycin. The most active oral antistaphylococcal agents were tetracycline (95{\%} susceptibility), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (94{\%}), and clindamycin (94{\%}). Of agents not typically recommended as monotherapy, 98{\%} of isolates were susceptible to rifampin, 91{\%} to moxifloxacin, and 60{\%} to levofloxacin. The most common pulsed-field type (PFT) was USA300 (79{\%}). The typical staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec IV elements carrying the CA-MRSA resistance genes were present in 88{\%} of the isolates. Panton-Valentine leukocidin virulence genes were identified in 88{\%} of isolates, including 100{\%} of PFT USA300. The virulence gene associated with an arginine catabolic mobile element was present in 75{\%} of isolates, including 94{\%} of PFT USA300. CONCLUSION: This study is the first genotypic and phenotypic characterization of CA-MRSA recovered from wound cultures in a deployed combat hospital.

A new group of class A beta-lactamases, known as KPC-type carbapenemases, has recently been described and poses a serious clinical challenge. METHODS: Seven patients with bloodstream infections caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates with decreased susceptibility to carbapenems were identified between January and April 2005 in the intensive care units of a hospital in Manhattan. Isolate identification and susceptibility testing were performed according to National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards methodology. All isolates were ribotyped and screened for (bla)KPC by polymerase chain reaction. The polymerase chain reaction product underwent nucleotide sequencing for one of the isolates. Medical records were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: Six isolates were carbapenem-resistant with minimum inhibitory concentrations for imipenem of {\textgreater}8microg/mL. Ribotyping showed that all isolates belonged to a single clone. All isolates possessed (bla)KPC and nucleotide sequencing identified the allelic type KPC-2. Patients' median age was 68 years. The median duration of hospitalization was 25.5 days before the first positive blood culture. Five of 6 patients received previous broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics but none received prior carbapenems. Five of 6 isolates were susceptible to polymyxin B. Three of the 5 patients were treated with polymyxin B and 1 survived. Overall, only 2 of the 6 patients survived.

Cases meeting all the following criteria were classified as artemisinin resistant: failure to clear parasites within 7 days of treatment or reemergence of parasites within 28 days of follow-up; adequate plasma concentrations of dihydroartemisinin; prolonged parasite clearance; and increased in vitro drug susceptibility levels for dihydroartemisinin. RESULTS: Two (3.3{\%}) of 60 artesunate-treated patients were classified as artemisinin resistant. Their parasite clearance times were prolonged (133 and 95 h, compared with a median of 52.2 h in patients who were cured). These patients had 50{\%} inhibitory concentrations of dihydroartemisinin that were almost 10 times higher than the reference clone W2. Resistance did not appear to be mediated by the pfmdr1 copy number or selected PfATPase6 polymorphisms previously proposed to confer artemisinin resistance. CONCLUSION: Artemisinin resistance has emerged along the Thai-Cambodian border. The potentially devastating implications of spreading resistance to a drug that currently has no successor call for further studies of this emerging problem.

15378,yes,ochoa2013,article,"BACKGROUND: Enterococcus faecium has recently emerged as a multidrug-resistant nosocomial pathogen involved in outbreaks worldwide. A high rate of resistance to different antibiotics has been associated with virulent clonal complex 17 isolates carrying the esp and hyl genes and the purK1 allele. RESULTS: Twelve clinical vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) isolates were obtained from pediatric patients at the Hospital Infantil de Mexico Federico Gomez (HIMFG). Among these VREF isolates, 58.3{\%} (7/12) were recovered from urine, while 41.7{\%} (5/12) were recovered from the bloodstream. The VREF isolates showed a 100{\%} rate of resistance to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, gentamicin, rifampicin, erythromycin and teicoplanin. In addition, 16.7{\%} (2/12) of the isolates were resistant to linezolid, and 66.7{\%} (8/12) were resistant to tetracycline and doxycycline. PCR analysis revealed the presence of the vanA gene in all 12 VREF isolates, esp in 83.3{\%} (10/12) of the isolates and hyl in 50{\%} (6/12) of the isolates. Phylogenetic analysis via molecular typing was performed using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and demonstrated 44{\%} similarity among the VREF isolates. MLST analysis identified four different sequence types (ST412, ST757, ST203 and ST612). CONCLUSION: This study provides the first report of multidrug-resistant VREF isolates belonging to clonal complex 17 from a tertiary care center in Mexico City. Multidrug resistance and genetic determinants of virulence confer advantages among VREF in the colonization of their host. Therefore, the prevention and control of the spread of nosocomial infections caused by VREF is crucial for identifying new emergent subclones that could be challenging to treat in subsequent years.",S A Ochoa and G Escalona and A Cruz-Cordova and L B Davila and Z Saldana and V Cazares-Domimguez and C A Eslava and B Lopez-Martinez and R Hernandez-Castro and G Aquino-Jarquin and J Xicohtencatl-Cortes,1471-2180,BMC Microbiol,"*Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial,Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology,Blood/microbiology,Cross Infection/epidemiology/microbiology,DNA, Bacterial/genetics,Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field,Enterococcus faecium/*classification/drug effects/,Genes, Bacterial,Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections/*epidemiology/*,Hospitals, Pediatric,Humans,Mexico/epidemiology,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Molecular Epidemiology,Multilocus Sequence Typing,Phylogeny,Polymerase Chain Reaction,Tertiary Care Centers,Urine/microbiology,purification",291,{Molecular analysis and distribution of multidrug-resistant Enterococcus faecium isolates belonging to clonal complex 17 in a tertiary care center in Mexico City},NA,13,2013,NA,"1471-2180

In this study, acquisition of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Salmonella spp. in 2013 Hajj pilgrims from Marseille, France, was investigated. In total, 267 rectal swabs were collected from 129 participants before their departure and after their return from the pilgrimage as well as during the pilgrimage from patients with diarrhoea. Samples were screened for the presence of Salmonella using quantitative real-time PCR and culture. Whole-genome sequencing was performed to characterise one of the isolates, and the mechanism leading to colistin resistance was investigated. Six post-Hajj samples and one sample collected during a diarrhoea episode in Hajj were positive for Salmonella by real-time PCR, with five Salmonella enterica belonging to several serotypes recovered by culture, whereas no pre-Hajj sample was positive. Two of the isolates belonged to the epidemic Newport serotype, were resistant to cephalosporins, gentamicin and colistin, and harboured the bla(CTX-M-2) gene and a 12-nucleotide deletion in the pmrB gene leading to colistin resistance. This study shows that pilgrims acquired Salmonella bacteria, including a novel MDR clone, during the Hajj pilgrimage. This calls for more improved public health surveillance during Hajj because Salmonella is one of the most common diarrhoea-causing bacteria worldwide. Therefore, returning pilgrims could disseminate MDR bacteria worldwide upon returning to their home countries.",A O Olaitan and N M Dia and P Gautret and S Benkouiten and K Belhouchat and T Drali and P Parola and P Brouqui and Z Memish and D Raoult and J M Rolain,"1872-7913

15547,maybe,oneko2015,article,"BACKGROUND: Nontyphoidal Salmonella (NTS), mainly serotypes Typhimurium and Enteritidis, cause invasive infections with high mortality in children in sub-Saharan Africa. Multidrug resistance is common, and resistance to third-generation cephalosporins has emerged. METHODS: We reviewed clinical features, outcomes, and antimicrobial resistance patterns in invasive NTS infections among children aged 6 weeks to 5 years participating in malaria vaccine studies in an area of high malaria and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission in Siaya, western Kenya. Blood culture was performed in hospitalized children and pediatric outpatients with prolonged fever. RESULTS: From July 2009 to December 2013, 1696 children aged 6 weeks to 17 months were enrolled into vaccine trials and followed for up to 53 months. We obtained 1692 blood cultures from 847 children. Of 134 bacterial pathogens isolated, 102 (76.1{\%}) were Salmonella serogroup B or D. Invasive NTS disease occurred in 94 (5.5{\%}) children, with an incidence of 1870, 4134, and 6510 episodes per 100 000 person-years overall, in infants, and in HIV-infected children, respectively. Malaria infection within the past 2 weeks occurred in 18.8{\%} (3/16) of invasive NTS episodes in HIV-infected and 66.2{\%} (53/80) in HIV-uninfected children. Case fatality rate was 3.1{\%}. Salmonella group B resistant to ceftriaxone emerged in 2009 and 2010 (6.2{\%} [2/32 isolates]), rising to 56.5{\%} (13/23 isolates) in 2012 and 2013. CONCLUSIONS: Incidence of invasive NTS disease was high in this area of high malaria and HIV transmission, especially in HIV-infected children.

15604,maybe,orlovic2009,article,"Background: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has been an important nosocomial pathogen worldwide for more than four decades. Community-acquired MRSA infections, generally occurring in previously healthy persons without recognizable risk factors for health care setting-related MRSA, are emerging as serious clinical and public health concerns. The most frequent of these community-based infections include skin and soft tissue infections and necrotizing pneumonias. A majority of causative communityacquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) isolates are associated with genes that encode the virulence factor, Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) toxin. Aims {\&} Objectives: To describe six cases of CA-MRSA pneumonia recently admitted to our community hospital in Florida, and discuss the epidemiology, clinical features, and management of these expanding infections. Methods/Study Design: The medical records of six patients with radiographically-confirmed pneumonia and positive sputum cultures for MRSA at the time of hospitalization at the Lawnwood Regional Medical Center and Heart Institute, Fort Pierce, Florida, from December 2006 through January 2007, were retrospectively reviewed. All patients were seen by one of the authors (DO), an infectious diseases consultant. Lawnwood Regional Medical Center is a 341-bed, acute care institution and regional referral center for four counties of Treasure Coast, FL. The hospital institution review board gave permission for this study. Results/Findings: Six patients (5 men, 1 woman) with CA-MRSA pneumonia were identified. The mean patient age was 57 years (range, 32-79 years). Three patients had no history of previous hospital admission, while two patients had been last hospitalized two years prior to the study admission. Three elderly patients had known co-morbidities predisposing to pneumonia including carcinoma of the lung (2 patients), and cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, COPD, and cardiomyopathy (1 patient each). Sputum samples were collected at the time of admission and all grew MRSA. Two isolates were resistant only to oxacillin, while four were also resistant to levofloxacin (3 isolates), erythromycin (2 isolates), ciprofloxacin (1 isolate), and/or clindamycin (1 isolate). One patient had concurrent Pseudomonas bacteremia, and another had Pseudomonas isolated from sputum culture in addition to MRSA. All patients had abnormal chest radiographs; three had focal unilateral pneumonia, two had bilateral pneumonia, and one had a lung abscess. The latter patient also had evidence of metastatic infection with sternoclavicular osteomyelitis. Three patients required ventilatory support; two of these subjects died and one was discharged to hospice care. None of the six patients had any epidemiologic connection to one another. Conclusion: CA-MRSA is becoming an increasingly important cause of communityacquired pneumonia in many parts of the world, and in these regions empiric antibiotic treatment guidelines should be reconsidered. {\textcopyright} 2009 Orlovic, D. {\&} Smego, R.A.",D Orlovic and R A Smego,1840-4529,International Journal of Collaborative Research on Internal Medicine and Public Health,"Pseudomonas,Pseudomonas aeruginosa,Pseudomonas pneumonia,United States,adult,aged,antibiotic resistance,article,aztreonam,cardiomyopathy,chronic kidney failure,chronic obstructive lung disease,ciprofloxacin,clindamycin,clinical article,clinical feature,community acquired pneumonia,community hospital,comorbidity,controlled study,diabetes mellitus,erythromycin,female,human,infection,levofloxacin,linezolid,liver cirrhosis,lung abscess,lung carcinoma,male,methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus,methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus infect,nonhuman,osteomyelitis,oxacillin,sputum culture,thorax radiography,tigecycline,vancomycin",73--82,{Emerging community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l358844024 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=18404529{\&}id=doi:{\&}atitle=emerging+community-acquired+methicillin-resistant+staphylococcus+aureus+pneumonia{\&}sti,1,2009,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,maybe,jake,no,zach,ayomide,zach_3,yes,zm_3.csv,NA,NA,zm_3_4.mex,yes,journal
15625,maybe,oshun2012,article,"Objective: Carbapenem use is still low in Nigeria because they are expensive, not readily available and are reserved for life threatening gram negative infections. While carbapenem resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae is increasingly reported worldwide, there is limited data from Africa. The Lagos University Teaching hospital is a 761 bed referral hospital with an inpatient population of about 11 000 annually. Klebsiella pneumoniae has been identified as a major health care associated pathogen with reports of increasing resistance to various antibiotics. This study was undertaken to identify the risk factors for infection with carbapenem resistant K. pneumoniae (CRKP). Methods: The study was conducted over a 6 month period and all inpatients with microbiological confirmation of carbapenem resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae infection were recruited as cases. Controls were in-patients with carbapenem susceptible Klebsiella pneumoniae infections. Carbapenem resistance was determined using disc diffusion tests and carbapenemase production was confirmed using the modified Hodge test. Patient data as well as data on antibiotic use and hospital stay were collected using a simple questionnaire. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were carried out to determine the association between potential risk factors and carbapenem resistance. Results: Klebsiella pneumoniae was isolated from 153 in-patients of which eight were carbapenem resistant. Bivariate analysis showed that the use of three or more antibiotics (p = 0.03) and previous hospital admission (p = 0.05) were associated with CRKP infections. The use of three or more antibiotics (odds ratio [OR], 9.0 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.12-90.25) was an independent risk factor for the development of CRKP infections using multivariate analysis. Only four out of the eight CRKP isolates could be identified by the modified Hodge test (MHT) as carbapenemase producers. Resistance rates to other commonly used antibiotics were {\textgreater} 50{\%} except for amikacin to which resistance rate was 25{\%}.

15650,maybe,otsuka2006,article,"During a 53-month period (March 1994 to August 1998), 48 Corynebacterium striatum isolates recovered from clinical specimens were characterized. The organisms were identified by both phenotypic characteristics and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Thirty-six (75{\%}) were isolated from sputum/bronchial aspirates, 10 (21{\%}) from wound exudates/pus, 1 (2{\%}) from vaginal discharge, and 1 (2{\%}) from an otorrheic specimen. All 48 patients had been hospitalized for treatment of an underlying disease and had received antibiotics previously. The C. striatum isolates were considered pathogenic based on their abundance within polymorphonuclear neutrophils and their dominant growth in culture. Sensitivities of isolates to 11 antibiotics were determined by broth microdilution. MIC90 values of the isolates were 1 microg/mL for vancomycin, 16 microg/mL for penicillin and ampicillin, 32 microg/mL for minocycline, and {\textgreater} or = 32 microg/mL for cephalosporins, imipenem, ofloxacin, and macrolides. Restriction fragment-length polymorphism analysis with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was used to determine the clonal identity. The pulse-field gel electrophoresis profiles revealed 14 distinct patterns with 20 subtypes. The isolates for the nosocomial outbreaks of C. striatum included 3 types (A, D, and E) with 4 subtypes (A1, A2, D2, and E). All 4 genotypes had broad-spectrum resistance to antimicrobial agents. Furthermore, type E strain isolated from 3 patients in the same ward was sensitive only to vancomycin.

15757,maybe,paget2014,article,"New Delhi metallo-$\beta$-lactamase-1 is a recently described gene that codes for carbapenem resistance. Inherently transferable between Gram-negative bacteria on a plasmid that also confers extended antibiotic resistance, it represents a potentially serious problem for susceptible patients, such as burn victims, and is spreading globally at a rapid rate. The authors present a case of a septic burn patient returning from India, whose microbiological cultures grew bacteria expressing New Delhi metallo-$\beta$-lactamase-1. His TBSA was 14{\%}. His length of stay as an inpatient was 95 days. This is the first case report of this resistance strain from a U.K. burns unit. Isolation, barrier nursing and the use of hydrogen peroxide vapor decontamination proved effective in limiting transmission and spread.

We also describe the molecular characteristics of PVL-MRSA and antibiotic resistance phenotypes. A total of 55,760 specimens were screened for MRSA between April 2008 and December 2010. MRSA was identified in 1,998 specimens, and ciprofloxacin-susceptible (CSMRSA) isolates (385/1,998, or 19.3{\%}) were subjected to PVL testing. Of these, 70 (18.1{\%}) were identified as PVL-CSMRSA. During the study period, the MRSA colonization rate decreased from 4.6{\%} to 2.8{\%}. In contrast, the colonization rate of PVL-CSMRSA increased over time, rising from 0.075{\%} in 2008 and 0.07{\%} in 2009 to 0.22{\%} in 2010. The mean patient age was 52 years (range, 18 to 90 years); over two-thirds were male. Seven different lineages of PVL-CSMRSA were identified. Over the 3 years, the Southwest Pacific clone (CC30) was dominant in our population. The CC5 clone was detected once in 2008 and not at all in 2009 but accounted for a third of all PVL-CSMRSA strains in 2010. This lineage was commonly associated with clindamycin resistance and, less frequently, tetracycline resistance. We conclude that there is hitherto unrecognized low-level carriage of PVL-CSMRSA among patients being admitted to hospitals in northwest London.

S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus isolated from blood cultures of inpatients, attended at a teaching hospital, were analyzed for the presence of the mecA gene and by SCCmec typing. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of tigecycline, linezolid, daptomycin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, and vancomycin were determined. Isolates exhibiting vancomycin MICs of â¥2 $\mu$g/ml were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The rate of mecA positivity was 92.9{\%} and 100{\%} in S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus, respectively. The most frequent SCCmec types were type III (53.2{\%}) in S. epidermidis and type I (32.1{\%}) in S. haemolyticus. All isolates were susceptible to linezolid and daptomycin, but 7.1{\%} of S. haemolyticus and 2.3{\%} of S. epidermidis isolates were resistant to tigecycline, and 1.2{\%} each of S. haemolyticus and S. epidermidis were resistant and intermediately resistant to quinupristin/dalfopristin, respectively. S. epidermidis exhibited higher vancomycin MICs (40{\%} with MIC of â¥2 $\mu$g/ml). Clonal typing of strains with vancomycin MIC of â¥2 $\mu$g/ml revealed the presence of different PFGE types of S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus over a period of up to 4 years (2002-2004, 2005-2008, 2006-2009, 2010-2011). Despite the observation of a high prevalence of mecA, the clinical strains were fully susceptible to vancomycin and to the new drugs linezolid, daptomycin, tigecycline, and quinupristin/dalfopristin.

METHODS: PCR and sequencing were used to search for beta-lactamase genes. Clonal relationships between the isolates were analysed by multilocus sequence typing and PFGE. RESULTS: A history of prior hospitalization in the same ward was determined for two of the three patients. The three isolates of K. pneumoniae belonged to the same sequence type (ST), ST15, and were clonally related. All three isolates carried the bla(NDM-1) gene and co-expressed the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases CTX-M-15 and SHV-5, as well as the narrow-spectrum beta-lactamases SHV-1, OXA-1, OXA-9 and TEM-1.

16752,maybe,pollini2013,article,"Acquired metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs) are resistance determinants of increasing clinical importance in Gram-negative bacterial pathogens, which confer a broad-spectrum beta-lactam resistance, including carbapenems. Several such enzymes have been described since the 1990s. In the present study, a novel acquired MBL, named FIM-1, was identified and characterized. The bla(FIM-1) gene was cloned from a multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolate (FI-14/157) cultured from a patient with a vascular graft infection in Florence, Italy. The isolate belonged in the sequence type 235 epidemic clonal lineage. The FIM-1 enzyme is a member of subclass B1 and, among acquired MBLs, exhibited the highest similarity (ca. 40{\%} amino acid identity) with NDM-type enzymes. In P. aeruginosa FI-14/157, the bla(FIM-1) gene was apparently inserted into the chromosome and associated with ISCR19-like elements that were likely involved in the capture and mobilization of this MBL gene. Transfer experiments of the bla(FIM-1) gene to an Escherichia coli strain or another P. aeruginosa strain by conjugation or electrotransformation were not successful. The FIM-1 protein was produced in E. coli and purified by two chromatography steps. Analysis of the kinetic parameters, carried out with the purified enzyme, revealed that FIM-1 has a broad substrate specificity, with a preference for penicillins (except the 6alpha-methoxy derivative temocillin) and carbapenems. Aztreonam was not hydrolyzed. Detection of this novel type of acquired MBL in a P. aeruginosa clinical isolate underscores the increasing diversity of such enzymes that can be encountered in the clinical setting.",S Pollini and S Maradei and P Pecile and G Olivo and F Luzzaro and J D Docquier and G M Rossolini,"0066-4804

16946,yes,principe2017,article,"Objectives NDM-producing Enterobacteriaceae are considered emergent on the African continent and have been increasingly reported in recent years. In contrast, strains producing NDM-type enzymes have been rarely reported in Italy, usually associated with sporadic cases or small outbreaks. Here we report two cases of infection caused by NDM-1-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (NDM-KP) in two unrelated patients returned from travel to Egypt. Case reports The two patients had been previously hospitalised for a short period in two different Egyptian hospitals. In our institution in Italy, NDM-KP isolates were detected from surgical wound drainage (patient {\#}1) and respiratory secretions and blood cultures (patient {\#}2). Rectal swabs of both patients were persistently positive for NDM-KP. In both cases, NDM-1-producing isolates exhibited a multidrug-resistant phenotype, being susceptible only to tigecycline and colistin. Analysis by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) revealed that the two K. pneumoniae isolates were not clonally related, belonging to different sequence types (STs), namely ST15 from patient {\#}1 and ST11 from patient {\#}2. Conclusions To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of NDM-producing isolates imported from Africa to Italy, with no obvious link to the Indian subcontinent. Our experience confirms that Egypt is an emergent source of NDM-producing Enterobacteriaceae, thus representing a cause of concern for Mediterranean countries. Owing to its geographical position, Italy is a first-line European checkpoint with respect to African countries and plays a pivotal role in limiting the dissemination of high-risk clones, especially considering the latest strong migration flows.",L Principe and C Mauri and V Conte and B Pini and T Giani and G M Rossolini and F Luzzaro,"2213-7173

We describe the first detection of A. baumannii carrying the blaNDM-1 gene in Lebanon, isolated from Syrian patients wounded during the civil war. METHODS: Four carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii strains isolated in 2012 in the Tripoli Government Hospital, Lebanon, from civilians wounded during the Syrian war, were analysed. Susceptibility was determined by disk diffusion testing, and resistance to carbapenems was confirmed by Etest. The presence of blaOXA-23-like, blaOXA-24-like, blaOXA-58-like, blaOXA-143-like, and blaNDM was investigated by PCR. Clonal relationships were studied by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and blaOXA-51 sequence-based typing. RESULTS: All isolates harboured the blaNDM-1 gene and were negative for other tested carbapenemases. They all belonged to the sequence type 85 and formed a single cluster by PFGE. Finally, blaOXA-51-like gene sequencing revealed the presence of the blaOXA-94 variant in all four isolates.

In particular, detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) in Salmonella spp. is a newly emerging threat worldwide. This study was carried out to characterize beta-lactamase-producing Salmonella strains identified in Tehran, Iran. Over the 2-year period from 2007 to 2008, 6 of 136 Salmonella isolates recovered from pediatrics patients, including three Salmonella enterica serotypes Enteritidis (S. Enteritidis) and three S. Infantis, showed an ESBL-positive phenotype. Polymerase chain reaction and sequencing were used to identify the genetic determinants responsible for ESBL phenotypes. The Salmonella isolates were also compared by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. All ESBL-producing strains, but one, carried the bla(CTX-M-15) gene. Moreover, three of four strains that proved to be positive for a bla(TEM) gene were producing a TEM-1 beta-lactamase. Two strains of S. Infantis tested positive for a previously unidentified CTX-M and TEM ESBL, respectively. All ESBL-producing strains carried the insertion sequence ISEcp1 gene. Except for one strain of serotype Infantis, all strains were able to transfer the ESBL determinants by conjugation. Distinct, but closely related, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns were observed among the strains belonging to both serotypes. This study reports for the first time the emergence and characterization of ESBL-producing S.

17315,maybe,rastegarlari2013,article,"Background: Resistance to antimicrobial agents such as carbapenems among enterobacteriacea has been increasing, especially in Klebsiella pneumonia that produces variety of enzymes including Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC). This study is the first report of its kind investigating the resistance to carbapenems among burns patients in Iran. Method: During a 6-month period, 28 hospitalized burn patients who required to be placed on broad spectrum antibiotics were studied. Isolated species identified by routine biochemical test. Susceptibility testing for these species was performed by recommended the CLSI guidelines method. The tested antibiotics included cefotaxime, cefepime, aztreonam, imipenem, amoxicillin + clavulonic acid, gentamicin, amikacin, tobramycin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and chloramphenicol. For determination of KPC in phenotypical forms, Modified Hodge Test was utilized as per CLSI recommendation. Results: Thirty-five Klebsiella spp. were isolated from 28 hospitalized patients. Nineteen out of 35 Klebsiella isolates were resistant to imipenem and that all of them had positive KPC. Nine of imipenem resistant isolates were also resistant to all tested antibiotics. Mortality rate among patients with positive KPC was 33{\%}. Conclusion: High rate of multi-drug resistant (MDR) strains in isolates with positive KPC is a major challenge in Iran and that it could cause an increase in both mortality and morbidity among burn patients. Thus, appropriate infection control measures and guidelines are needed to prevent such infections among burn patients. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI.",A {Rastegar Lari} and L Azimi and M Rahbar and F Fallah and R Alaghehbandan,"0305-4179

Leprosy is a specific infection: (i) it is a chronic infection primarily affecting the skin and peripheral nerves, (ii) Mycobacterium leprae is one of the last bacterial species of medical interest that cannot be cultured in vitro (mainly because of its reductive genome evolution), and (iii) transmission and pathophysiological data is still limited. The various presentations of the disease (Ridley-Jopling and WHO classifications) are correlated with the patient's immune response, bacillary load, and by the delay before diagnosis. Multidrug therapy (dapsone, rifampicin, with or without clofazimine) has been recommended since 1982 as the standard treatment of leprosy; 6. months for patients presenting with paucibacillary leprosy and 12. months for patients presenting with multibacillary leprosy. The worldwide use of leprosy drugs started in the 1980s and their free access since 1995 contributed to the drastic decline in the number of new case patients.

Imipenem resistance was detected after imipenem-ertapenem therapy. When treatment was switched to tigecycline the K. pneumoniae developed resistance to tigecycline (MIC=8mg/L). The nine isolates were tested by determination of agar dilution MICs, phenotypic carbapenemase, extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) testing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Polymerase chain reaction and sequencing analysis were employed for identification of bla genes and mapping of the integron carrying the MBL gene. The nine isolates were clonally related and all produced the SHV-12 enzyme. Five MBL-producing isolates showed imipenem MICs ranging from 2 to 64mg/L and all were detected by testing with imipenem and EDTA. The five isolates harboured the blaVIM-1 gene. Three isolates showed increased tigecycline MICs (4-8mg/L). Serial blood cultures obtained on the same day resulted in a VIM-positive/tigecycline-susceptible and a VIM-negative/tigecycline-resistant K. pneumoniae isolate. No isolate developed concurrent imipenem and tigecycline resistance. The patient had a persistent urinary tract infection and recurrent bacteraemia caused by a mixed population of Klebesiella pneumoniae isolates adapting to the selective pressure of antimicrobial therapy at the time. The present study is a worrisome example of what could happen when an immunocompromised host is subjected to the pressures of antimicrobial therapy.

Both strains belong to the sequence type (ST) 8 community-associated genetic lineage that carries the staphylococcal chromosomal cassette mec (SCCmec) type IVa and the S. aureus protein A gene (spa) type t292 and are phylogenetically related to MRSA lineage USA300.

17892,maybe,rostoff2010,article,"We report a case of pacemaker endocarditis due to Stenotrophomonas maltophilia in a 22-year-old Caucasian man with d-transposition of the great arteries after atrial switch procedure. S.maltophilia isolated from blood cultures was susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and amikacin, and resistant to ciprofloxacin and all tested $\beta$-lactam antibiotics. The infected pacemaker system was completely removed by thoracotomy. Simultaneously, a new DDD pacemaker and epicardial electrodes were successfully implanted and selective antibiotic therapy consisting of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (480 mg i.v. q 6 h) and amikacin (250 mg i.v. twice daily) was continued. However, the post-operative course was complicated by septic shock and the patient died on 9th day after surgery. Importantly, S.maltophilia isolated from extracted pacemaker leads was multidrug-resistant including to trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, all tested aminoglycosides, and $\beta$-lactams, with the exception of ticarcillin-clavulanate. In conclusion, pacemaker endocarditis due to Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is an extremely rare but serious complication of permanent pacing therapy. The susceptibility of S.maltophilia isolates to antimicrobial agents can change during the course of infection. Despite the inherent resistance of S.maltophilia to most $\beta$-lactam antibiotics, multidrug-resistant strains may be susceptible in vitro to ticarcillin-clavulanate. Further studies are needed to determine the optimal management of patients with pacemaker endocarditis caused by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",P Rostoff and A Paradowski and A Gackowski and E Konduracka and N {El Massri} and G Gajos and R Pfitzner and R Drwila and J Sadowski and W Piwowarska,0167-5273,Int J Cardiol,",*Stenotrophomonas maltophilia,Artificial/*microbiology,Bacterial/*diagnosis/therapy,Endocarditis,Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections/*diagnosis/ther,Humans,Male,Pacemaker,Prosthesis-Related Infections/*diagnosis/therapy,Stenotrophomonas maltophilia,Transposition of Great Vessels/*surgery,Young Adult,adult,amikacin,amoxicillin,antibiotic therapy,article,bacterial endocarditis,bacterium isolation,beta lactam antibiotic,blood culture,case report,ciprofloxacin,cotrimoxazole,death,great vessels transposition,heart atrium pacemaker,human,in vitro study,male,nonhuman,postoperative period,priority journal,septic shock,thoracotomy,vancomycin",e92--e95,{Stenotrophomonas maltophilia pacemaker endocarditis in a patient with d-transposition of the great arteries after atrial switch procedure},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l360124499 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcard.2008.12.164 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=01675273{\&}id=doi:10.1016{\%}2fj.ijcard.2008.12.164{\&}atitle=stenotro,145,2010,3,"from duplicate 2 (stenotrophomonas maltophilia pacemaker endocarditis in a patient with d-transposition of the great arteries after atrial switch procedure - rostoff, p; paradowski, a; gackowski, a; konduracka, e; el massri, n; gajos, g; pfitzner, r; drwila, r; sadowski, j; piwowarska, w)

18007,yes,rush2007,article,"PURPOSE: To report a case of chronic unilateral conjunctivitis caused by Alcaligenes xylosoxidans. METHODS: A previously healthy 47-year-old woman presented with left eye purulent discharge and irritation beginning 3 months earlier. The patient had previously been treated with bacitracin and olopatadine without improvement. Bacterial staining, culture, and antibiotic sensitivities were performed from a conjunctival swab. RESULTS: The cultures revealed heavy growth of A. xylosoxidans. The organism was resistant to aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, and cephalosporins. The patient was started on polytrim, but an allergic reaction forced the use of topical Timentin 2{\%}. After 14 days of treatment, the infection completely resolved. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first case report of an external ocular infection caused by A. xylosoxidans in a host without predisposing risk factors and the first case report of isolated conjunctivitis caused by A. xylosoxidans. A. xylosoxidans should be considered a rare but potential pathogen capable of producing chronic conjunctivitis in an otherwise healthy host.",R Rush and M Friedlander,"0277-3740 (print)

Seven different serotypes (14, 9V, 23F, 19F, 6B, 19A, and 6A, in order of descending frequency), seven alleles of the murM gene (murMA, murMB6, and the new murMB12 to -16 alleles), and 31 multilocus sequence types (STs) were observed. The vast majority of the PNSP isolates (90.7{\%}) belonged to the international multiresistant clones, and among these, the Spain(9V)-ST156 clonal complex was the most prevalent (56 isolates) and was significantly overrepresented in invasive infections. The clone has been evolving rapidly, as demonstrated by the observed number of STs, the diversity in multiple-locus variable-number-tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA) types, and the polymorphism of pbp and pspA genes (coding for penicillin-binding proteins and the pneumococcal surface protein A, respectively). The presence and structure of the rlrA islet (encoding the pneumococcal pilus) were very well conserved. The Spain(9V)-ST156 clonal complex has been largely responsible for a decreasing susceptibility to penicillin among pneumococci in Poland in recent years, in spite of a relatively moderate antimicrobial use.",E Sadowy and A Kuch and M Gniadkowski and W Hryniewicz,0066-4804,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,"*Evolution, Molecular,Aminoacyltransferases/genetics,Bacterial Proteins/*genetics,Drug Resistance, Bacterial/genetics,Fimbriae, Bacterial/physiology,Humans,Molecular Sequence Data,Penicillin-Binding Proteins/genetics,Peptide Synthases/genetics,Peptidyl Transferases/genetics,Pneumonia, Pneumococcal/drug therapy/*microbiology,Polymorphism, Genetic,Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length,Serotyping,Streptococcus pneumoniae/classification/drug effec",1720--1727,{Expansion and evolution of the Streptococcus pneumoniae Spain9V-ST156 clonal complex in Poland},NA,54,2010,5,"1098-6596

The patient was first colonized by an epidemic ampicillin-resistant E. faecium (ARE)-ST117 clustering into lineage 78. This clone exhibited resistance to levofloxacin, erythromycin and high-level resistance to streptomycin and gentamicin. After receiving treatment with several broad spectrum antibiotics for febrile neutropenia, a 9-day course of oral linezolid was administered once the patient developed bacteraemia by the same ARE colonizing clone. Linezolid-resistant ARE was detected 17 days later in the follow-up fecal samples and persisted 41 days after suppression of linezolid therapy.

The exact national scenario of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is not known in India owing to the absence of a central monitoring agency. Aims: The aim of this study is to identify the group of organisms developing resistance, to know the classes of drugs against, which resistance has emerged and to assess the possible factors that can favor the development of AMR so that antibiotic policy can be formulated for the proper and effective use of antibiotics. Settings and Design: An observational study was conducted for a period of 1 year from August 2011 to July 2012 in a tertiary care hospital in Pondicherry. Subjects and Methods: Data regarding culture and sensitivity of the organisms isolated from different sources such as urine, blood, wound swab/pus, stool, sputum and tracheal aspirations were collected from the records of the Microbiology Department. Sample processing, identification of organisms to the genus and/or species level and antimicrobial sensitivity were carried out as per the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines on the 999 samples received. Results: Out of 999 samples, 125 (12.5{\%}) showed significant growth of organisms exhibiting resistance to either single or multiple drugs. Out of 84 (67.2{\%}) in-patients and 41 (32.8{\%}) out-patient samples, Escherichia was the most common organism isolated with a total of 41 (32.8{\%}), followed by Methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, 26 (20.8{\%}), Klebsiella 25 (20{\%}), Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus 17 (13.6{\%}), Pseudomonas 10 (8{\%}), Proteus 2 (1.6{\%}), 1 (0.8{\%}) each of Citrobacter and Enterococci. Maximum resistance was observed with commonly used first line antimicrobials such as co-trimoxazole, ampicillin, amoxicillin, amoxyclav, fluoroquinolones, third generation cephalosporins and nalidixic acid. Least resistant or highly sensitive were amikacin, nitrofurantoin, gentamycin and doxycycline among the gram-negative bacteria. Macrolides, clindamycin, gentamycin, nitrofurantoin, vancomycin were the most sensitive antimicrobials against the gram-positive bacteria. Lack of knowledge on the consequences of inappropriate use of antibiotics was exhibited by 63{\%} of subjects in our study. Conclusions: AMR was more with hospital acquired organisms and against commonly used antibiotics that are available since long period. Variation of resistance and sensitivity pattern with time and geographical location is identified. Periodic AMR monitoring and rotation of antibiotics are suggested to restrict further emergence of resistance.",R Saravanan and V Raveendaran,"0976-0105

18726,yes,scott2007b,article,"BACKGROUND: We investigated an outbreak of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex infection among US service members injured in Iraq. METHODS: The investigation was conducted in Iraq and Kuwait, in the 2 military hospitals where the majority of injured service members were initially treated. After initially characterizing the outbreak, we evaluated 3 potential sources of infection for the period March 2003 to December 2004. The evaluation included screening samples that were obtained from the skin of patients for the presence of colonization and assessing the soil and health care environments for the presence of A. baumanii-calcoaceticus complex organisms. Isolates obtained from samples from patients in US Military treatment facilities, as well as environmental isolates, were genotypically characterized and compared using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: A. baumanii-calcoaceticus complex organisms were present on the skin in only 1 (0.6{\%}) of 160 patients who were screened and in 1 (2{\%}) of 49 soil samples. A. baumanii-calcoaceticus complex isolates were recovered from treatment areas in 7 of the 7 field hospitals sampled. Using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, we identified 5 cluster groups in which isolates from patients were related to environmental isolates. One cluster included hospitalized patients who had not been deployed to Iraq. Among the clinical isolates, only imipenem, polymyxin B, and colistin demonstrated reliable in vitro antimicrobial activity. Generally, the environmental isolates were more drug susceptible than were the clinical isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that environmental contamination of field hospitals and infection transmission within health care facilities played a major role in this outbreak. On the basis of these findings, maintaining infection control throughout the military health care system is essential. Novel strategies may be required to prevent the transmission of pathogens in combat field hospitals.",P Scott and G Deye and A Srinivasan and C Murray and K Moran and E Hulten and J Fishbain and D Craft and S Riddell and L Lindler and J Mancuso and E Milstrey and C T Bautista and J Patel and A Ewell and T Hamilton and C Gaddy and M Tenney and G Christopher and K Petersen and T Endy and B Petruccelli,1058-4838,Clin Infect Dis,"*Disease Outbreaks,*Equipment Contamination,Acinetobacter Infections/drug therapy/*epidemiolog,Acinetobacter baumannii/*drug effects/genetics/pat,Acinetobacter calcoaceticus/*drug effects/genetics,Adult,Cross Infection/epidemiology/*microbiology/transmi,Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial/*drug effects,Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field,Environmental Exposure,Female,Hospitals, Military,Humans,Infection Control/methods,Iraq/epidemiology,Kuwait/epidemiology,Male,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Military Personnel,Molecular Epidemiology,Phylogeny,United States",1577--1584,{An outbreak of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex infection in the US military health care system associated with military operations in Iraq},NA,44,2007,12,"1537-6591

18833,maybe,senok2007,article,"BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae represent key aetiological agents in respiratory tract infections showing an increasing trend of antimicrobial resistance. We present the first report on the antimicrobial resistance in S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae isolated from patients in the United Arab Emirates. METHODS: One hundred S. pneumoniae and 102 H. influenzae strains were isolated from patients with community acquired respiratory tract infections during the study period (October 2004-March 2006). Susceptibility testing to a panel of antibiotics was conducted using disc diffusion and E test. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were interpreted using CLSI and Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) breakpoints. RESULTS: For S. pneumoniae isolates, 57{\%} were penicillin susceptible while 98{\%} were susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanate with both interpretative criteria. Cefaclor was the least effective cephalosporin with only 57{\%} and 43{\%} of isolates showing susceptibility with CLSI and PK/PD breakpoints respectively. Thirty-six isolates were ofloxacin non-susceptible (intermediate and resistant); three resistant isolates were associated with high ciprofloxacin MICs ({\textgreater}8 mg/L). There was elevated macrolide resistance with associated high levels of erythromycin/clindamycin cross-resistance (n=22/30) suggesting predominant erm(B)-mediated resistance and 21{\%} of isolates demonstrated multidrug resistance. For H. influenzae, 18{\%} were beta-lactamase producers. Reduction in cefaclor and cefprozil susceptibility with PK/PD breakpoints (94.1{\%} to 41.2{\%} and 62.7{\%} respectively) was seen and only 1{\%} remained azithromycin and clarithomycin susceptible. For both pathogens, lowest susceptibility was with co-trimoxazole. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate a high level of penicillin resistance and continued usefulness of amoxicillin/clavulanate.

Thirteen of these 21 patients (62{\%}) had received linezolid during the 3 months preceding S. epidermidis recovery. Two closely related pulsotypes (P1a and P1b) were identified among the 27 studied isolates that belonged to the sequence type ST2 and harboured the mecA gene and the SCCmecIII type. The strains recovered from patients 1-4 (pulsotype P1a) showed the nucleotide mutation G2474T inside the amplified fragment of the 23S rRNA region and carried the aac(6')-Ie-aph(2'')-Ia, ant(4'), and catA genes, whereas the strains from patients 5-21 (pulsotype P1b) showed the mutation G2603T and carried the aac(6')-Ie-aph(2'')-Ia gene. None of the strains amplified the cfr gene. The ica gene and the IS256 element were detected in all strains. The emergence of 2 closely related methicillin- and linezolid-resistant S. epidermidis strains with 2 different mutations in the 23S rRNA region (G2474T and G2603T) is reported in this study as a cause of a nosocomial outbreak. The presence of G2474T or G2603T point mutations suggests that there are multiple potential sites within domain V of the 23S rRNA region at which mutations could confer resistance to linezolid in the clinical isolates.

18911,maybe,sgambati2011,article,"Colistin (COL) is an important antibiotic for treatment of multi-drug resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa in CF airway infection. Chronic treatment with inhaled COL has led to the development of COL-resistant P. aeruginosa (CRPA) strains at some European CF centers, and patient-topatient transmission has been reported at two such centers. The objective of this study was to assess retrospectively the prevalence and molecular epidemiology of CRPA in the U.S., in light of data indicating that chronic inhaled COL use here is more prevalent than generally recognized. As part of this study, â¼1100 isolates referred from U.S. CF centers to the CF Synergy Lab (Columbia University) as MDR P. aeruginosa and initially tested as resistant or intermediate to COL during 2000 - 2007 were transferred to a research repository, re-coded, re-speciated and re-tested; â¼410 isolates were confirmed as CRPA. A limited data set that links isolate codes to specimen receipt dates and patient, center, and region codes enabled analysis of temporal trends and geographic relationships without revealing patient or center identities. Overall, 57 U.S. CF patients had â¥2 CRPA isolates, and 14 had â¥4 isolates. Sixteen U.S. centers were identified at which at least three patients had had at least one CRPA isolate cultured. Our analysis focused on three centers, each with a relatively large number of CRPA isolates: Center J, with 20 isolates collected from 15 patients; Center M, with 12 isolates from 10 patients; and Center N, with 13 isolates from 9 patients. About half of these isolates were highly COL resistant (MIC {\textgreater} 1024 mg/L, or 128-fold above the current CLSI-defined lower limit of resistance). The phoPQ parRS, and pmrAB loci encode two-component systems (TCS) that regulate COL resistance mechanisms; mutations in these loci can lead to resistance. To understand the nature of such mutations in this set of 48 isolates, alleles of the phoQ (PA1180), parS (PA1799), and pmrB (PA4777) sensor kinase genes were sequenced. In Center J, 13 isolates derived from 10 patients shared a single distinct pmrB double mutation (all 13 isolates were WT at the phoQ and parS loci). MLST genotyping of these isolates performed through analysis of aroE (PA0025), trpE (PA0609), acsA (PA0887), ppsA (PA1770), and mutL (PA4946) confirmed that these 13 isolates represented a single clone shared among the patients. Additional shared strains with different phoQ, parS, and pmrB mutations were observed in all three centers generally involving pairs of patients. While the molecular epidemiology suggests the occurrence of patient-to-patient transmission of CRPA strains within these centers, in the absence of contact tracing other possible modes of transmission such as spread from a non-CF point source cannot be excluded. Moreover, sharing of clonal CRPA isolates between patients at different centers has not yet been observed. This represents the first reported spread of CRPA strains within U.S. cystic fibrosis centers.",N Sgambati and S A Clock and N Dasgupta and L Saiman and S M Moskowitz,8755-6863,Pediatric Pulmonology,"Colombia,Pseudomonas,Pseudomonas aeruginosa,United States,allele,antibiotic agent,clone,colistin,contact examination,cystic fibrosis,gene,genotype,human,identity,long term care,molecular epidemiology,mutation,patient,phosphotransferase,prevalence,respiratory tract infection,sensor,university",325,{Sharing of colistin-resistant pseudomonas within cystic fibrosis centers in the united states},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l70555185 http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ppul.21583 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=87556863{\&}id=doi:10.1002{\%}2fppul.21583{\&}atitle=sharing+of+colistin-resistant,46,2011,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,maybe,melanie,maybe,zach,zach,zach_3,no,zm_3.csv,could not find full-text,NA,NA,no,journal
18971,maybe,shamaei2009a,article,"OBJECTIVE: Resistance to anti-tuberculosis (anti-TB) drugs is becoming a major and alarming threat in most regions worldwide. METHODS: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study at a tertiary hospital in Iran, using patient medical records for 2000-2003. The findings were analyzed following the same framework as that used for previous reports from this center. RESULTS: Among 1556 TB patients, drug susceptibility testing (DST) was performed for 548 culture-positive cases. Anti-TB drug resistance to both isoniazid and rifampin was identified in 10 (2.8{\%}) of the new TB cases (multidrug-resistant TB; MDR-TB). Any resistance was detected in 228 (41.6{\%}), showing an increasing trend in both new and retreatment cases. The data analysis revealed that drug-resistant TB had a statistically significant association with Afghan ethnicity, age{\textgreater}65 years, and the type of disease (retreatment vs. new TB case) (p{\textless}0.05). Also, assessment of the drug resistance trends showed a significant increase in resistance to any anti-TB agent, to isoniazid, and to streptomycin in new cases, and to all of the first-line anti-TB drugs in retreatment patients. CONCLUSIONS: There has been an increasing trend in drug resistance in recent years, particularly in retreatment cases.

19250,maybe,siddaiahgari2014,article,"Background: Outcome of pediatric cancers has significantly improved with modern chemotherapy and good supportive care. However, febrile neutropenia remains one of the important limiting factors in these patients especially with the emergence of resistant organisms. Choosing appropriate antimicrobials is possible only if we understand the local microbial spectrum and their sensitivity pattern. Aims: To study the likely etiologic agents and their antibiotic sensitivity pattern among systemic infections in children with cancer. Settings and Design: This is a prospective study. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted at a tertiary care center for pediatrics, in which culture samples representing blood stream infections and others like urinary tract infections sent from the Oncology services of the Hospital during the year of 2013 were analyzed. The microbiological profile and antibiotic sensitivity pattern of these isolates were studied. Results: There were 89 isolates that represented blood and urinary tract infections in neutropenic patients with cancer.Out of 89 positive cultures 76 were gram negative isolates. The most common gram negative bacterial isolates were Escherichia coli 33 (37{\%}), followed by Pseudomonas 21 (23.5{\%}). Acinetobacter grew in 2 patients (2.2{\%}). Extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL's), carbepenem resistant and pan-resistant organisms seen in 28 (31.4{\%}), 5 (5.6{\%}) and 2 cases (2.3{\%}) respectively. Over all Gram-positive organisms were 13/89 (12.3{\%}). Staphylococcus was the most common Gram-positive organism and methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus seen in 5each.

19267,yes,sievert2008,article,"Background. This report compares the clinical characteristics, epidemiologic investigations, infection-control evaluations, and microbiologic findings of all 7 of the cases of vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA) infection in the United States during the period 2002-2006. Methods. Epidemiologic, clinical, and infection-control information was collected. VRSA isolates underwent confirmatory identification, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and typing of the resistance genes. To assess VRSA transmission, case patients and their contacts were screened for VRSA carriage. Results. Seven cases were identified from 2002 through 2006; 5 were reported from Michigan, 1 was reported from Pennsylvania, and 1 was reported from New York. All VRSA isolates were vanA positive and had a median vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration of 512 $\mu$g/mL. All case patients had a history of prior methicillin-resistant S. aureus and enterococcal infection or colonization; all had several underlying conditions, including chronic skin ulcers; and most had received vancomycin therapy prior to their VRSA infection. Person-to-person transmission of VRSA was not identified beyond any of the case patients. Infection-control precautions were evaluated and were consistent with established guidelines. Conclusions. Seven patients with vanA-positive VRSA have been identified in the United States. Prompt detection by microbiology laboratories and adherence to recommended infection control measures for multidrug-resistant organisms appear to have prevented transmission to other patients. {\textcopyright} 2008 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

METHODS: The size and restriction patterns of the plasmids were determined, and antibiotic resistance genes were identified using DNA-DNA hybridization, PCR assays, hybridization of PCR products with internal probes, and sequencing. RESULTS: All CTX-M plasmids were large (58-320 kb) and carried the following genes: aac(6')-Ib (aminoglycoside resistance) which included aac(6')-Ib-cr (aminoglycoside-fluoroquinolone resistance), aadA2 (aminoglycoside resistance), erm(B) (macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B resistance), blaTEM-1 (ampicillin resistance), tet(A) (tetracycline resistance), sul1 (sulphonamide resistance), dfr (trimethoprim resistance) and intI1, an integrase associated with class 1 integrons. Eleven (65{\%}) plasmids carried an mph(A) gene (macrolide resistance), seven (41{\%}) plasmids carried a qnrB1 gene (low-level quinolone resistance) and four (24{\%}) plasmids carried multiple cat genes (chloramphenicol resistance). catA2, catA3 and qnrB1 genes and a 6 kb PstI fragment, carrying the blaCTX-M gene, were sequenced.

20356,maybe,tai2013,article,"Introduction Emergence of carbapenem (CPM) resistant Pa due to metallobeta- lactamase (MBL) associated with class I integrons (int1) poses a health risk to persons with CF. Currently, there are no guidelines for MBL screening and the prevalence of MBL-producing Pa among Australian CF patients is unknown. Aims We sought to: i) compare five MBL phenotypic screening tests, and ii) determine MBL/int1 prevalence among Pa isolates collected from Australian CF patients. Methods Pa isolates collected from 5 Australian adult CF centres were included. 50 randomly selected CPM resistant and 50 matched CPM susceptible isolates were analyzed using the MBL Etest, Double Disc Diffusion test (DDDT), Combined Disc test (CDT), Modified Hodge test (MHT), and antibiogram evaluation. In addition, 509 CPM resistant isolates were screened for int1 and MBL genes by real-time PCR. Results Etest, MHT and stringent antibiogram criteria correctly identified MBL in 2 (Non-CF) Pa reference strains but variable specificity (20{\%}; 86{\%}; 88{\%}, respectively) was observed when applied to CF Pa isolates. Stringent antibiogram has the best positive predictive value (25{\%}). Molecular screening of the 509 isolates (173 patients) revealed that 22 isolates (4.3{\%}) harboured the int1 gene. Interestingly, the AUST-02 strain was associated with higher prevalence of int1 (OR: 2.8; p = 0.04). No MBL-producing isolates were identified. Conclusions In isolates collected in 2007, no MBL Pa isolates were identified.

First identified from air samples in South Korea, it has never been associated with any clinical infections. We described here the first human infection secondary to X. aerolatus in a four-year-old boy with catheter-related peritonitis and the characterization of this organism. Methods: Peritoneal fluid was inoculated directly onto a combination of agar plates. The bacterial isolate (NML100527) was further characterized by conventional biochemicals, gas chromatography and 16S rRNA sequencing. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by broth microdilution. Results: A patient with end-stage renal failure, on CAPD, presented with acute abdominal pain and fever one day after returning from a 10-day trip to Hawaii and Connecticut. 4 of 4 peritoneal fluid cultures were positive for X. aerolatus over a 20-day period. Pinpoint yellow colonies were isolated from Columbia sheep blood and chocolate agar incubated at 35oC in CO2 after 2 days. There was no growth anaerobically. The isolate was motile, Gram-negative and appeared coccobacillary to short rods in shape. It was oxidase and catalase positive, but nitrate, gelatin, cetramide, esculin, and triple decarboxylases negative. It was asaccharolytic and hydrolyzed xanthine, hypoxanthine, and tyrosine. 16S rRNA sequencing showed 100{\%} homology with the type strain X. aerolatus 5526S-2T.

Pre-2007 reports were almost exclusively from Turkey, but subsequently its distribution has expanded. We report an early and prolonged outbreak in the UK of Klebsiella pneumoniae producing OXA-48 carbapenemase affecting a predominantly renal cohort in a West London hospital. Carbapenemase production was detected by the modified Hodge test, with confirmation by PCR for bla OXA-48. Isolates were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Risk factors for acquisition were determined. Between January 2008 and April 2010, 20 K. pneumoniae isolates with reduced susceptibility to carbapenems were identified from 13 patients, comprising 12 renal cases and 1 oncology patient; 8 were outpatients and 5 were inpatients; 7 were deemed to be colonised and 6 infected, including 2 with bacteraemia, 1 of whom died. Hodge tests were positive for all isolates and all had blaOXA-48. PFGE showed strain similarity in isolates from nine patients, whereas four patients' isolates were distinct, representing three further PFGE profiles and suggesting horizontal spread of blaOXA-48. Most patients had received antibiotics in the preceding 3 months and all had healthcare contact, but none had recent travel to areas with endemic OXA-48 Enterobacteriaceae. The renal cohort was screened and a prevalence rate of 0.17{\%} was found.

20788,yes,thomas2011b,article,"Objective: To identify the resistance mechanism and determine appropriate antibiotic treatment for a patient whose blood and abdominal fluid isolated an E. coli resistant to ertapenem and the cephalosporins, with borderline imipenem and meropenem resistance. To highlight problems with detection and difficulties with treatment of multi drug resistant Gram negative organisms. Methods: Following hospitalisation for an MI in Egypt, requiring ITU care in The Nile Hospital, the patient was repatriated via air-ambulance to Wythenshawe Hospital for cardiac rehabilitation and subsequently developed an acute abdomen secondary to cholycystitis. Laporotomy and cholecystectomy were carried out and cultures from blood and drain fluid isolated a resistant E. coli. Routine in-house antibiotic susceptibility testing of the isolates was undertaken by VITEK. Resistance was confirmed by the Reference Laboratory who carried out MICs to cephalosporins, carbapenems, aminoglycosides, tigecycline and other agents by agar dilution. Potential carbapenemase activity was examined by a plate assay (Clover Leaf test), followed by enzyme identification by PCR. Results: A pure growth of E. coli with reduced carbapenem susceptibility was isolated. MICs of carbapenems were ertapenem = 8, meropenem = 1 and imipenem = 2. The isolate was clover leaf positive for carbapenemase activity and PCR identified an OXA48. The isolate was pan-$\beta$-lactam-resistant due to a CTX-M, seen by the MIC of Cefotaxime potentiated from {\textgreater}256 to 1, whilst ceftazidime fell from 32 to 1. The isolate was sensitive to tigecycline, which the patient received for 10 days resulting in full recovery. A detailed travel history revealed visits to Tunisia, Spain and Portugal but no travel to Greece or Turkey, during the past 5 yrs. Conclusion: OXA48 has not previously been identified in an E. coli in the UK. Detection of this carbapenemase is problematic as resistance to ertapenem may be the only indicator, yet the MIC of ertapenem can be readily raised by impermeability alone, making its use as a single maker uncertain. Dissemination of OXA48 has to date, been geographically and species restricted and not previously associated with E. coli or with travel to Egypt.

Recently, clarithromycin resistant H. pylori strains represent the main cause of treatment failure. Therefore this study aimed to determine the prevalence and pattern of H. pylori resistance to clarithromycin in Suranaree University of Technology Hospital, Suranree University of Technology, Nakhon Ratchasima, Northeastern Thailand, Nakhon Ratchasima province, northeast of Thailand. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This hospital-based cross-sectional study was carried out between June 2014 and February 2015 with 300 infected patients interviewed and from whom gastric mucosa specimens were collected and proven positive by histology. The gastric mucosa specimens were tested for H. pylori and clarithromycin resistance by 23S ribosomal RNA point mutations analysis using real-time polymerase chain reactions. Correlation of eradication rates with patterns of mutation were analyzed by chi-square test. RESULTS: Of 300 infected patients, the majority were aged between 47-61 years (31.6{\%}), female (52.3{\%}), with monthly income between 10,000-15,000 Baht (57{\%}), and had a history of alcohol drinking (59.3{\%}). Patient symptoms were abdominal pain (48.6{\%}), followed by iron deficiency anemia (35.3{\%}). Papaya salad consumption (40.3{\%}) was a possible risk factor for H. pylori infection. The prevalence of H. pylori strains resistant to clarithromycin was 76.2{\%}. Among clarithromycin-resistant strains tested, all were due to the A2144G point mutation in the 23S rRNA gene. Among mutations group, wild type genotype, mutant strain mixed wild type and mutant genotype were 23.8{\%}, 35.7{\%} and 40.5{\%} respectively. With the clarithromycin-based triple therapy regimen, the efficacy decreased by 70{\%} for H. pylori eradication (P{\textless}0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Recent results indicate a high rate of H. pylori resistance to clarithromycin. Mixed of wild type and mutant genotype is the most common mutant genotype in Nakhon Ratchasima province, therefore the use of clarithromycin-based triple therapy an not advisable as an empiric first-line regimen for H. pylori eradication in northeast region of Thailand.",T Tongtawee and C Dechsukhum and L Matrakool and S Panpimanmas and R A Loyd and S J Kaewpitoon and N Kaewpitoon,"1513-7368 (print)

21005,maybe,touchan2013,article,"Case Report: We describe the first case of septic shock due to urinary tract infection caused by Hafnia alvei in the United States. A 59-year-old woman presented with a five day history of left lower extremity swelling. She had a history of Crohn's disease complicated by small bowel resection and multiple fistula repairs, and recurrent deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. In the emergency department, venous Doppler showed DVT of the LLE and the patient was admitted for anticoagulation therapy. On day 8 of hospitalization, the patient developed tachypnea, hypoxia, tachycardia, and hypotension refractory to fluid resuscitation. The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit as she required vasopressors. Her white blood cell count was 21,800 with a left shift. The patient was started on meropenem and vancomycin empirically, after blood and urine cultures were sent. The patient's urine culture grew H. alvei 9100,000 colonies/ml, resistant to ampicillin and cefazolin but sensitive to ceftriaxone. Blood cultures remained negative. The antibiotics were changed to ceftriaxone. The patient's condition improved after 24 hours. She was weaned off vasopressors. The patient's septic shock was attributed to her urinary tract infection caused by H. alvei. H. alvei is a member of the Enterobacteriaceae family that rarely affects humans. Only 12 cases of infections caused by H. alvei have been reported in the US with only one case of pyelonephritis. Our case is unique, being the first case of H. alvei urinary tract infection leading to septic shock. Hafnia causes a variety of systemic infections, including septicemia and pneumonia. Our patient's presentation was consistent with previous literature that shows higher rates of H. alvei infection in patients with Crohn's disease, previous abdominal surgery and female sex. Hafniae are typically resistant to penicillin and their susceptibility to tetracyclines and cephalosporins is variable. Most reported H. alvei cases are polymicrobial; monomicrobial infections are uncommon. Conclusion: Although H. alvei infections are rare in the US, clinicians should have a high level of suspicion due to their potential morbidity in the susceptible host.",J Touchan and J Bellardini and J Maharaj and I Alexandraki,1081-5589,Journal of Investigative Medicine,"Crohn disease,Enterobacteriaceae,Hafnia,Hafnia alvei,United States,abdominal surgery,ampicillin,antibiotic agent,anticoagulant therapy,blood,blood culture,case report,cefazolin,ceftriaxone,cephalosporin derivative,deep vein thrombosis,emergency ward,female,fistula,fluid resuscitation,hospitalization,human,hypertensive factor,hypotension,hypoxia,infection,intensive care unit,leg,leukocyte count,lung embolism,medical research,meropenem,morbidity,patient,penicillin derivative,pneumonia,pyelonephritis,septic shock,septicemia,small intestine resection,swelling,tachycardia,tachypnea,tetracycline derivative,urinary tract infection,urine culture,urosepsis,vancomycin",417,{First case of hafnia alvei urosepsis in the united states},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l70993092 http://dx.doi.org/10.231/jim.0b013e3182820c55 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=10815589{\&}id=doi:10.231{\%}2fjim.0b013e3182820c55{\&}atitle=first+case+,61,2013,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,yes,brooke,maybe,ayomide,ayomide,zach_3,no,zm_3.csv,could not find full-text,NA,NA,no,journal
21027,maybe,toyne2012,article,"Background/Objectives: Antibiotic resistance in the community, including transfer between bacteria, is a growing concern for clinicians. Acne is commonly treated in general practice, sometimes with antibiotics. The aim of this study is to measure the rate of carriage of antibiotic resistant Propionibacterium acnes 10 years apart in general practice and the relationship of resistance to type of treatment, as well potential effects on other flora. Methods: Patients (N = 215) with acne presenting to Australian Capital Territory and south-eastern New South Wales general practices were swabbed for P. acnes in 1997-1998 and 2007. Clinical details were collected with questionnaires. In 2007 swabs were also taken for Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. GP's diagnostic classification of acne was tested using a set of standard photographs. Results: Resistant P. acnes was isolated from 20 patients (9{\%}) and the proportion that was resistant was the same in 1997-1998 and in 2007. Antibiotic use, particularly topical, was associated with P. acnes resistance. Resistance rates declined with the time elapsed since ceasing antibiotics. Use of retinoids was associated with a decreased chance of growing P. acnes (P = 0.008) but not with decreased resistance. Simultaneous resistance with S. aureus was not detected, but only in 30 patients was S. aureus isolated. Conclusions: P. acnes resistance was similar in 1997-1998 and in 2007.The chance of a patient carrying a resistant strain of P. acnes is significantly greater with recent exposure to antibiotics, and clinicians should limit prescribing where possible. Resistance disappears rapidly after ceasing antibiotics. Cross resistance with other organisms was not detected in this study. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Australasian College of Dermatologists.",H Toyne and C Webber and P Collignon and K Dwan and M Kljakovic,0004-8380,Australasian Journal of Dermatology,",*Drug Resistance,*Propionibacterium acnes,*Staphylococcus aureus,Acne Vulgaris/drug therapy/*microbiology,Adolescent,Adult,Anti-Bacterial Agents/*adverse effects,Australian Capital Territory,Bacterial,Corynebacterium,Female,General Practice,Humans,Male,New South Wales,Propionibacterium acnes,Staphylococcus aureus,Streptococcus pneumoniae,Young Adult,acne,antibiotic agent,antibiotic resistance,antibiotic sensitivity,article,bacterial growth,bacterial strain,bacterium isolation,ciprofloxacin,clinical classification,disease association,disease severity,doxycycline,erythromycin,female,general practice,human,major clinical study,male,meticillin,minocycline,nose smear,observational study,penicillin G,prescription,questionnaire,tetracycline",106--111,{Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) resistance and antibiotic use in patients attending Australian general practice},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l51874983 http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1440-0960.2011.00867.x http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=00048380{\&}id=doi:10.1111{\%}2fj.1440-0960.2011.00867.x{\&}atitle=p,53,2012,2,"from duplicate 2 (propionibacterium acnes (p. acnes) resistance and antibiotic use in patients attending australian general practice - toyne, h; webber, c; collignon, p; dwan, k; kljakovic, m)

Analysis included antimicrobial susceptibility profiling and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Resistance mechanisms to beta-lactams were identified: production of naturally occurring and acquired beta-lactamases, overproduction of MexAB-OprM and MexXY efflux systems and loss of porin OprD were assessed. Eighteen patients were colonised or infected with XDRPA which remained susceptible to colistin and, to a lesser extent, to rifampicin. beta-lactam resistance was, in most cases, due to the overproduction of AmpC, overproduction of the MexXY efflux system and loss of porin OprD. One isolate produced the class D extended-spectrum oxacillinase (OXA-ESBL) Oxa-28, but none produced metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) or class A extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL). The XDRPA clustered in eight PFGE patterns and both the acquisition and loss of resistance determinants was observed within a single clone during its spread.

We thus conducted this prospective study to analyze the molecular epidemiology of K. pneumoniae isolates from patients being treated in the 306 Hospital in Beijing, China for the period of November 1, 2010-October 31, 2011. Methodology/Principal Findings: Antibiotic susceptibility testing, PCR amplification and sequencing of the drug resistance-associated genes, and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) were conducted. A total of 163 isolates were analyzed. The percentage of MDR, XDR and PDR isolates were 63.8{\%} (104), 20.9 (34), and 1.8{\%} (3), respectively. MLST results showed that 60 sequence types (STs) were identified, which were further separated by eBURST into 13 clonal complexes and 18 singletons. The most dominant ST was ST15 (10.4{\%}). Seven new alleles and 24 new STs were first identified in this study. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that certain clinical characteristics were associated with those prevalent STs such as: from ICU, from medical ward, from community acquired infection, from patients without heart disease, from patients with treatment success, susceptible to extended spectrum cephalosporin, susceptible to cephamycins, susceptible to fluoroquinolones, and with MDR. Conclusions/Significance: Our data indicate that certain drug-resistant K. pneumoniae clones are highly prevalent and are associated with certain clinical characteristics in hospital settings. Our study provides evidence demonstrating that intensive nosocomial infection control measures are urgently needed. {\textcopyright} 2013 Wang et al.",Q Wang and B Li and A K L Tsang and Y Yi and P C Y Woo and C H Liu,1932-6203,PLoS ONE,",*Cross Infection,*Genetic Variation,*Genotype,80 and over,Adolescent,Adult,Aged,Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology,Bacterial,Bacterial/*genetics,Child,China,Drug Resistance,Essential,Female,Genes,Genetic,Humans,Infant,Klebsiella Infections/diagnosis/epidemiology/*micr,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Klebsiella pneumoniae/classification/drug effects/,Male,Middle Aged,Multilocus Sequence Typing,Phylogeny,Preschool,Selection,Young Adult,adolescent,adult,aged,aminoglycoside antibiotic agent,antibiotic resistance,article,bacterial virulence,bacterium isolate,beta lactamase CTX M,beta lactamase SHV,beta lactamase TEM,cephalosporin,cephamycin derivative,child,clonal variation,controlled study,extensively drug resistance,female,gene cluster,gene frequency,gene linkage disequilibrium,gene locus,gene sequence,genetic analysis,genetic variability,hospital infection,hospital patient,human,hydrolase,infant,intensive care unit,major clinical study,male,molecular epidemiology,multidrug resistance,nonhuman,pandrug resistance,phylogeny,polymerase chain reaction,population genetic structure,prevalence,quinoline derived antiinfective agent,sputum analysis,tertiary health care,unclassified drug,ward",e57091,{Genotypic Analysis of Klebsiella pneumoniae Isolates in a Beijing Hospital Reveals High Genetic Diversity and Clonal Population Structure of Drug-Resistant Isolates},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l368409460 http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0057091 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=19326203{\&}id=doi:10.1371{\%}2fjournal.pone.0057091{\&}atitle=genotypi,8,2013,2,"from duplicate 2 (genotypic analysis of klebsiella pneumoniae isolates in a beijing hospital reveals high genetic diversity and clonal population structure of drug-resistant isolates - wang, q; li, b; tsang, a k; yi, y; woo, p c; liu, c h)

22306,maybe,webster2011,article,"OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were: (i) to describe an outbreak of multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae in our population; (ii) to identify the potential source of this outbreak by examining antibiotic resistance trends in urocultures; (iii) to evaluate the contribution of this outbreak to resistance patterns over time in the two commonest Gram-negative blood culture isolates, namely K. pneumoniae and Escherichia coli; and (iv) to assess risk factors for multidrug resistance and the impact of this resistance on mortality and length of stay. METHODS: We searched Microbiology and Patient Administration Service databases retrospectively and describe resistance trends in E. coli and K. pneumoniae bloodstream infections (BSIs) in Oxfordshire, UK, over an 11 year period. RESULTS: An outbreak of a multidrug-resistant, CTX-M-15 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing K. pneumoniae clone was identified and shown by multilocus sequence typing to belong to a novel sequence type designated ST490. This was associated with a sporadic change in resistance rates in K. pneumoniae BSIs with rates of multidrug resistance (defined as resistance to three or more antibiotic classes) reaching 40{\%}. A case-control study showed prior antibiotic exposure as a risk factor for infection with this organism. During the same time period, rates of ESBL-producing Klebsiella spp. isolated from urocultures increased from 0.5{\%} to almost 6{\%}. By contrast, the rate of multidrug resistance in E. coli rose more steadily from 0{\%} in 2000 to 10{\%} in 2010. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in resistance rates may be associated with outbreaks of resistant clones in K. pneumoniae. Changing resistance patterns may affect important health economic issues such as length of stay.",D P Webster and B C Young and R Morton and D Collyer and B Batchelor and J F Turton and S Maharjan and D M Livermore and P Bejon and B D Cookson and I C J W Bowler,"0305-7453

The MICs of the isolates increased during therapy with vancomycin. The patient fractured her right hip while in the United States. She was started on treatment with vancomycin. The MICs of successive isolates increased from {\textless} or =1 to 4 mg/L over 6 months. Then, an isolate tested at 8 mg/L initially and 4 mg/L with confirmatory E-test (AB BIODISK, Solna, Sweden). One month later, MRSA was still present in her wound, and therapy was changed to linezolid with rifampin. Subsequent cultures were negative for MRSA. Susceptibility testing was performed on the BD Phoenix (Becton Dickinson Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, MD), Dade Microscan (Dade Behring Microscan, Sacramento, CA), Pasco MIC (Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD), Vitek 2 (bioMerieux, St. Louis, MO), and Sensititre (Trek Diagnostic Systems, Cleveland, OH) systems, and by E-test. Molecular typing (pulsed-field gel electrophoresis [PFGE]) was used to verify the relatedness of the isolates. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to assess the cell wall thickness of isolates with differing MICs. Population analysis was performed to assess for vancomycin hetero-resistance. MICs of 4 mg/L were only obtained with BD Phoenix, E-test, and broth microdilution. All isolates were identical by PFGE. The most resistant isolate had a thicker cell wall on TEM.

23183,maybe,yu2011b,article,"In this study, the antimicrobial susceptibilities and prevalence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants amongst Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium isolates from hospitalised paediatric patients with diarrhoea in China were investigated. In total, 40 (64.5{\%}) of 62 S. Typhimurium isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin (minimum inhibitory concentration {\textgreater}/=0.5 mug/mL), comprising 28 isolates with low-level resistance and 12 isolates with high-level resistance. All ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates were multiresistant to other antimicrobial agents. Four pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) clusters were found amongst the 40 ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates, amongst which PFGE clusters A, B, E and D accounted for 7, 4, 1 and 28 isolates, respectively. Two isolates with high-level ciprofloxacin resistance had two mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) of gyrA and parC. The remaining ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates had only one mutation in the QRDR of gyrA. All 62 S. Typhimurium isolates were negative for qnr genes and qepA and 23 (37.1{\%}) of the isolates were positive for aac(6')-Ib-cr. Nineteen isolates harbouring aac(6')-Ib-cr belonged to PFGE cluster D. A high prevalence of ciprofloxacin resistance and aac(6')-Ib-cr was found amongst S. Typhimurium isolates in China from hospitalised paediatric patients with diarrhoea not receiving quinolones. A single mutation in the QRDR of gyrA as well as production of AAC(6')-Ib-cr contributed to ciprofloxacin resistance. Clonal spread was responsible for the dissemination of aac(6')-Ib-cr amongst S.

23213,maybe,yuan2011,article,"BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) is a public health concern globally, and azithromycin-resistant NG isolates have been identified in many countries. This study aimed to investigate azithromycin susceptibility in NG and to genetically characterize the azithromycin-resistant isolates identified in 2 cities in China. METHODS: NG isolates (n = 318) were cultured from patients attending 2 sexually transmitted infection clinics in Nanjing and Chongqing, China, between 2008 and 2009. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of azithromycin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, spectinomycin and ceftriaxone was determined using the agar dilution method. NG strains ATCC 49226 and WHO G, J, L, and P were used for quality control. Azithromycin-resistant isolates were defined as having an MIC value equal to or greater than that of strain WHO P, which is internationally recognized as azithromycin-resistant (MIC = 2 mg/L), and genotyped using NG multiantigen sequence typing. RESULTS: The MIC values of strain WHO P for azithromycin were 2 to 4 mg/L in all runs, which showed that the method provided consistent and reliable MIC values. Seventeen isolates (5.3{\%}) showed resistance to azithromycin. Among these isolates (n = 17), 11 sequence types (STs) were identified by NG multiantigen sequence typing, of which 5 were novel. The most common ST was ST3356, represented by 6 isolates. ST1866 was represented by 2 isolates, which were isolated from patients with an unknown relationship, and both isolates were highly resistant to azithromycin, i.e., displayed an MIC of {\textgreater}64 mg/L.

This bacteraemia is resistant to sulphonamides, or fluoroquinolones, while the representative strain of S. maltophilia, K279a, is sensitive to both. To explore drug resistance determinants of this strain, the draft genome sequence of WJ66 was determined and compared to other S. maltophilia sequences. Genome sequencing and genome-wide evolutionary analysis revealed that WJ66 was highly homologous with the strain K279a, but strain WJ66 contained additional antibiotic resistance genes. Further analysis confirmed that strain WJ66 contained an amino acid substitution (Q83L) in fluoroquinolone target GyrA and carried a class 1 integron, with an aadA2 gene in the resistance gene cassette. Homology analysis from the pathogen-host interaction database showed that strain WJ66 lacks raxST and raxA, which is consistent with K279a.

Twenty-two non-duplicate CRKP strains were collected from pediatric patients between March and June in 2014. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted by the agar dilution method. Beta-lactamases were characterized by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing. The transferability of blaNDM-1 was investigated by conjugation experiment. The plasmids bearing antibiotic resistance genes were characterized by S1 nuclease pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (S1-PFGE) and Southern hybridization. Clonal relatedness was evaluated by PFGE and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). The clinical data of patients were retrospectively reviewed. The 22 CRKP strains were resistant to most of the antimicrobial agents tested, except tigecycline and colistin. Overall, 59, 77, and 100Â {\%} of these strains were resistant to imipenem, meropenem, and ertapenem, respectively. The blaNDM-1 was positive in 77.3Â {\%} (17/22) of the CRKP strains, of which the 16 isolates from inpatients were designated as ST37 (n = 9) and ST76 (n =7) and one isolate from an outpatient belonged to ST846.

23761,maybe,na:88,article,"On January 27, 2011, a West Virginia county health department was notified of a cluster of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) cases detected by a local hospital (hospital A). CRKP infections frequently are resistant to a majority of antimicrobial agents and have an increased risk for morbidity and mortality. The West Virginia Bureau for Public Health (WVBPH) conducted field investigations to identify all cases, characterize risk factors for infection, and abstract data for a matched case-control study. Nineteen case-patients and 38 control patients were identified. Infection with CRKP was associated with admission from or prior stay at a local long-term--care facility (LTCF A). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis indicated that all five hospital A clinical specimens and all 11 point prevalence survey isolates from LTCF A were closely related. This is the first outbreak of CRKP identified in West Virginia. Recommendations to LTCF A included the following: 1) initiate surveillance for multidrug resistant organisms; 2) revise and improve infection prevention and control activities within the facility; 3) educate residents and their families, physicians, and staff members about CRKP; and 4) identify qualified personnel to coordinate infection control functions within the facility. Although LTCF A has made significant improvements, the outbreak investigation is ongoing. Additional site visits have been conducted, and additional colonized residents have been identified; the last clinical case was detected in July.

E. coli isolates were collected over a 2-year period from patients presenting E. coli infections. Strains with reduced susceptibility to ertapenem and/or positive for ESBL were characterised with regard to antibiotic resistance, bla genes, phylogenetic groups, O25 serotyping, quinolone resistance, repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reaction (rep-PCR) profiles and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST). Of the 448 isolated E. coli, 94 (20.9 {\%}) were multidrug-resistant. One of them (1.1 {\%}) produced a blaOXA-48 and was identified as a B1 ST5 strain. The transposon bearing this gene was Tn1999.2. This strain was isolated from a patient coming from a border province with Tunisia, where this carbapenemase is endemic. In addition, 84 (18.8 {\%}) isolates among them produced an ESBL with predominance (97.6 {\%}) of blaCTX-M-15, which was coupled with qnr genes in 10.9 {\%}. ESBL-producing strains were mainly detected in phylogroups D and A. They displayed 20 rep-PCR profiles and all the clonally related isolates were of the same sequence type (ST). Ten strains (9.4 {\%}) belonged to the pandemic clone ST131.

Data are limited on the prevalence, pattern of resistance, and factors associated with resistant organisms. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the isolation prevalence and antibiotic resistance rate of P. aeruginosa species isolated in the North of Iraq and to determine the optimum effect of a combination antibiogram and its potential role in empirical treatment. Patients and Methods: The study samples were collected from two cities: Mosul and Duhok. The Mosul samples were taken from in-patient specimens sent for culture and antibiotic sensitivity to Al-Salam Teaching Hospital over a threeyear period (2003-2005). Duhok samples were obtained mainly from outpatient specimens sent to the laboratory of one of the two main private hospitals in the city for another three-year period (2007-2009). P. aeruginosa was identified by conventional methods and API 20 E (Biomerieux). Their antibiotic susceptibility was tested using the Kirby-Bauer plate diffusion method. Detection of combination effects was performed on Duhok samples by in vitro testing of different antimicrobial combination patterns commonly used in routine empirical practice. For this purpose combinations were chosen of the top four individual drugs demonstrating the highest susceptibilities by the standard antibiogram. Results: Out of 8038 and 1878 clinical specimens submitted for culture in Mosul and Duhok, respectively, 180 and 21 clinically significant isolates of P. aeruginosa were isolated, resulting in a prevalence of 5.2{\%} and 1.6{\%}, respectively. The most common isolates were from pus, followed by urine specimens and ear discharges. The isolates in males were twice that of females. The pattern of resistance revealed that amikacin had the highest sensitivity (89.7{\%}) followed by imipenem, tobramycin and piperacillin (85.6{\%}, 84.1{\%}, and 82.1{\%}, respectively). Cefotaxime showed the lowest sensitivity rate (66.4{\%}) followed by ceftazidime, carbenicillin, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin (70.1{\%}, 74.6{\%}, 76.1{\%}, and 79.1{\%}, respectively). The study revealed that the optimum combination therapy with the highest sensitivity rate was the combination of amikacin with either piperacillin or imipenem (95.2{\%}) and piperacillin with tobramycin (95.2{\%}). Conclusions and Recommendations: A relatively high resistance rate to first-line anti-pseudomonal drugs was observed, which should lead to continuous evaluation of hospital and community resistance patterns.

The prevalence of ESBL producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL-KP) strains isolated from patients has recently increased in Tunisia. We conducted this study to determine the prevalence and the genetic characterization of ESBL-KP in a Tunisian Hospital. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed antibiotic susceptibility testing, multiplex PCR, and DNA sequencing analysis on 118 non repetitive K. pneumonia strains isolated during three years, to determine the prevalence and genotypes of ESBL among K. pneumoniae clinical isolates. RESULTS: Most ESBL-producing K. pneumonia strains were isolated from hospitalized patients, especially in neonatal and pediatric wards. The resistance to other antibiotics was high. Most of the pathogens were isolated from the urinary tract (86.44{\%}). Carbapenems were the most effective antimicrobial agents followed by amikacin and fosfomycin. The rate of blaSHV, blaTEM, and blaCTX-M genes among the isolates was 89, 56.78, and 81.35{\%}, respectively. Sequencing revealed the amplicons encoding TEM-1, TEM-53, TEM-158, SHV-1, SHV-11, SHV-28, CTX-M-15, CTX-M-15-like. The blaCTX-M-15 was the dominant gene among Tunisian isolates, but this was the first report of blaTEM-53 and blaTEM-158 genes in the country.

Strains from all patients infected and/or colonized by MDRAB during outbreak periods were characterized using PFGE and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). The first outbreak appeared in the summer of 2009 involving 38 ICU patients: 25 from a Traumatology-Rehabilitation hospital (TRH) and 13 from a Medical-Surgery hospital (MSH). Between 2010 and 2011, outbreaks were limited to the MSH-ICU, affecting 9 and 11 patients, respectively. Two PFGE types were detected. In the 2009 outbreak, two clones were identified: profile 1 strains were isolated at the TRH, whilst profile 2 was isolated at the MSH. Only one clone was identified in the 2010 and 2011 outbreaks: the profile 2 clone detected at the MSH in 2009. After MLST analysis, a single sequence type (ST92) was identified. This suggested that an endemic strain could evolve and cause localized outbreaks in vulnerable patients. Multiplex PCR for OXA group enzymes yielded a positive result for blaOXA-58-like and blaOXA-51-like genes, and gene sequencing showed the presence of blaOXA-58.

This study was done to determine the frequency of ESBL-producing E coli and K pneumoniae species isolated from urine samples of our patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A study was conducted on 164 urine isolates (124 E coli and 40 K pneumoniae) in the laboratory Loghman Hakim Hospital in Tehran, Iran, in 2007. Microbial sensitivity tests were done on Mueller-Hinton agar plates with disk diffusion method. Broad-spectrum resistance was defined as resistance to ampicillin or cephalothin; ESBL resistance, as resistance of these bacteria to one of ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, or ceftizoxime; and MDR-ESBL; as resistance to 3 of the following antibiotic groups: trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, and nitrofurantoin. RESULTS: An ESBL resistance was detected in 52.5{\%} of isolates with K pneumoniae and 45.2{\%} of those with E coli. The MDR-ESBL pattern was detected in 26.8{\%} of the isolates. These included 30.0{\%} of the K pneumoniae and 25.8{\%} of the E coli isolates. Broad-spectrum resistance was detected in all K pneumoniae isolates and 87.9{\%} of 124 E coli isolates.

1080,yes,ashour2007,article,"Purpose: Cancer patients are particularly susceptible to nosocomial infections because of their compromised immune system, and because of the nature of treatment practices they experience. Recently, a shift of the microbial spectrum of cancer patients from Gram-negative to Gram-positive has been demonstrated. This study analyzed the distribution and the antimicrobial resistance of Gram-positive bacteria isolated from cancer patients in Egypt. Patients and Methods: We examined the microbial spectrum of Gram-positive bacteria in patients with hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. In addition, we also studied the antimicrobial resistance of pathogens accounting for the majority of Gram-positive infections in these cancer patients. Results: Most of Gram-positive isolates from urinary tract (100{\%}), respiratory tract (89.7{\%}), and bloodstream infections (BSIs; 65.5{\%}) were obtained from leukemic patients. All Gram-positive isolates from skin infections were isolated from solid-tumor patients. In both leukemic and solid-tumor patients, Gram-positive bacteria causing nosocomial BSI were mainly Coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CNS) and S aureus, whereas Gram-positive bacteria causing nosocomial RTI were mainly $\alpha$-hemolytic streptococci and CNS. Gram-positive bacteria were not isolated from GI tract infections. S aureus, CNS, and $\alpha$-hemolytic streptococci demonstrated methicillin resistance (81.5{\%}, 92.3{\%}, and 90{\%} resistance, respectively). S aureus and CNS were susceptible to linezolid (15.4{\%} and 0{\%} resistance, respectively), and vancomycin (15.5{\%} and 11{\%} resistance, respectively). Conclusion: This is the first study to report the emergence of vancomycin- and linezolid-resistant S aureus in Egypt. Newer generation quinolones (moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin) were more active than older quinolones (ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin) against S aureus and CNS, suggesting the use of newer generation quinolones in the prophylaxis of cancer patients. {\textcopyright} 2007 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",H M Ashour and A El-Sharif,0732-183x,Journal of Clinical Oncology,",Anti-Infective Agents,Cross Infection/*microbiology,Egypt,Gram-Positive Bacteria/*isolation {\&} purification,Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections/complications/*,Humans,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Neoplasms/*complications,Staphylococcus aureus,Staphylococcus epidermidis,Staphylococcus haemolyticus,Staphylococcus hominis,alpha hemolytic Streptococcus,antibiotic sensitivity,article,bacterium isolation,cancer patient,cancer research,hospital infection,human,leukemia,linezolid,priority journal,respiratory tract infection,skin infection,solid tumor,urinary tract infection,vancomycin",5763--5769,{Microbial spectrum and antibiotic susceptibility profile of gram-positive aerobic bacteria isolated from cancer patients},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l351024725 http://dx.doi.org/10.1200/jco.2007.14.0947 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=0732183x{\&}id=doi:10.1200{\%}2fjco.2007.14.0947{\&}atitle=microbial+spectr,25,2007,36,"from duplicate 2 (microbial spectrum and antibiotic susceptibility profile of gram-positive aerobic bacteria isolated from cancer patients - ashour, h m; el-sharif, a)1527-7755ashour, hossam mel-sharif, amanyjournal articleunited statesj clin oncol. 2007 dec 20;25(36):5763-9.",10.1200/jco.2007.14.0947,12/20/07,eng,18089873,maybe,cale,no,mushtaq,zach,zach_4,yes,zm_4.csv,NA,NA,zm_4_1.mex,yes,journal

1126,yes,atalar2013,article,"Introduction and Objectives: Selecting correct antibiotic prophylaxis before surgery is of increasing importance, with the emergence of resistant bacterial strains. Furthermore it is important to target the causative organisms with appropriate antibiotics, as illustrated in guidelines for stone procedures. We reviewed our prospectively captured database of patients undergoing endourological stone surgery over a 12 month period, to assess the types of organism and the antibiotic resistance patterns now emerging. Materials and Methods: We reviewed the records of all patients undergoing ureterorenoscopy/ percutaneous nephrolithotomy/ cystolithopaxy during a 12 month period, under the care of 2 surgeons. Pre-operative urine cultures were recorded, with the antibiotic resistance patterns; positive cultures were treated by antibiotics before surgery, and followed up to ensure the repeat cultures were subsequently negative. Results: From a total of 287 patients, 36 had a positive urine culture requiring antibiotic treatment before surgery. E Coli was the commonest organism (n=11), with ESBL (extended spectrum beta-lactamase) accounting for 3 of these cases; followed by Enterococcus faecalis (n=9), Pseudomonas (n=4), Coliforms (n=4), Klebsiella, Morganella, and Enterobacter cloacae (all n=1). The multi-resistant strains showed sensitivities to Meropenem, Ertapenem and Mecillinam. Conclusion: Our results are consistent with previous reports (BJUI 2009; 104: 760-4) showing that the 2 predominant organisms causing urine infection are E Coli and Enterococcus (Streptococcus) faecalis; it is therefore important to ensure that both Gram positive and negative organisms are covered if antibiotic prophylaxis is to be used in such surgery. Worryingly there is an increase in multiresistant patterns, leaving few available oral antibiotic choices, as particularly demonstrable in the ESBL cases. We have noted further emergence of resistance to co-amoxiclav, trimethoprim and ciprofloxacin, and reiterate the advice of guidelines that antibiotic prophylaxis in endourology (J Endourol 2009; 23: 1567- 70) should be rationalised according to findings of such microbiological reviews.",K Atalar and H Donaldson and A Shamsuddin and R Dasgupta,0090-4295,Urology,"Enterobacter cloacae,Enterococcus faecalis,Escherichia coli,Klebsiella,Morganella,Pseudomonas,amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid,antibiotic agent,antibiotic prophylaxis,antibiotic resistance,antibiotic therapy,bacterial strain,ciprofloxacin,data base,endourology,ertapenem,extended spectrum beta lactamase,human,mecillinam,meropenem,organisms,patient,procedures,surgeon,surgery,trimethoprim,urinary tract infection,urine culture",s110,{Selecting antibiotics for stone surgery},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l71352245 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=00904295{\&}id=doi:{\&}atitle=selecting+antibiotics+for+stone+surgery{\&}stitle=urology{\&}title=urology{\&}volume=82{\&}issue=3,82,2013,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,yes,allison,yes,nchedo,nchedo,zach_4,no,zm_4.csv,could not find full-text,NA,NA,no,journal

Materials and methods: A prospective surveillance study was performed from January 2006 through December 2007 in the medical and surgical wards of the ¡zmir Teaching and Research Hospital. Results: During the study period, data on 57,133 patients with a total of 413,515 patient-days were analyzed. A total of 106 HAP episodes occurred in 99 patients. The infection rate per 100 patients and per 1000 patient-days was found to be 0.2{\%} and 0.3{\%}, respectively. HAP episodes were detected mostly in medical wards (66{\%}). The mean age of patients was 58.6 å± 15.9 and 73{\%} of the patients were male. The most common intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors observed in patients with HAP, according to the first episode, were cardiovascular disease (47{\%}), central nervous system disease (41{\%}), malignancy (40{\%}), hospitalization longer than 5 days (91{\%}), antibiotic therapy (81{\%}), previous endotracheal intubation (40{\%}), nasogastric tubes (38{\%}), and H2 receptor antagonist/antiacid (37{\%}). Moreover, 109 microorganisms were isolated from 84{\%} of HAP episodes. Overall, the most frequently isolated pathogens from HAP episodes were Klebsiella pneumoniae (23{\%}), Escherichia coli (21{\%}), and Staphylococcus aureus (18{\%}). These were mostly multidrug-resistant. The crude mortality was found to be 25{\%}.

A 78 old male patient was admitted to Clinical Hospital Center Zagreb with subdural haematoma. He was previously diagnosed with acute myeloblastic leukemia. After surgical removal of haematoma he developed purulent meningtis. K. pneumoniae with reduced susceptibility to carbapenems was isolated. The patient died from intracerebral bleeding in April 2011. The antimicrobial susceptibility to a wide range of antibiotics was determined by broth microdilution method in Mueller-Hinton broth and 96 well microtiter plates according to CLSI guidelines. A double-disksynergy test was performed to detect ESBLs. Modified Hodge Test (MHT) was used to screen for production of carbapenemases. MBL E-test was used to screen for production of metallo-b-lactamases. The transferability of meropenem resistance was determined by conjugation (broth mating method) employing E. coli A15R-strain resistant to rifampicin. Transconjugant was selected on the combined plates containing meropenem (1 mg/L) and rifampicin (128 mg/mL). The presence of genes encoding ESBLs (blaSHV, blaTEM, blaCTX-M), plasmid mediated ampC b-lactamases and carbapenemases blaKPC, blaOXA-48, blaOXA-NDM, blaVIM and blaIMP was determined by PCR. Results: The isolate showed resistance or intermediate susceptibility to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins, beta-lactam combinations with inhibitors, carbapenems and gentamicin but remained susceptible only to ciprofloxacin and colistin. Modified Hodge test was consistent with the activity of carbapenemases. The MBL test for metallo-betalactamase was negative indicating the absence of metallo betalactamase. Imipenem resistance was not transferred to E. coli recipient strain by conjugation. PCR revealed the presence of blaKPC, blaTEM genes and blaSHV genes. Sequencing of blaKPC gene revealed the presence of KPC-2 beta-lactamase. Neither plasmidmediated AmpC beta-lactamase nor OXA-48 beta-lactamase were found.

1939,maybe,berger2016,article,"Background: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the most common cause of nosocomial diarrhoea. C. difficile ribotype 018 (RT018) has become the most prevalent strain in North Italy and has spread to several European countries as well as to East Asia (South Korea and Japan), where a growing number of RT018- related outbreaks have been reported. However, the RT018 strain has rarely been isolated in Central and Western Europe. In August 2015, C. difficile RT018 was detected in two hospitals in the German state of Baden-Wuerttemberg. An outbreak investigation was initiated in close cooperation between the local hospital hygiene team and the National Consultant Laboratory for C. difficile, followed by prospective ribotyping of all isolates for a period of two months. Here, we provide a preliminary report on this first RT018 outbreak in southern Germany. Method: C. difficile strains were detected and characterized using antigen detection, stool culture and PCR. Subsequently, capillary electrophoresis ribotyping and multiple-locus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA) were carried out on all C. difficile RT018 strains to investigate genetic relatedness and possible clonality. Result: In total, nine C. difficile RT018 isolates could be identified. All RT018 strains were genetically related and clustered into two clonal complexes. When compared with historic isolates from Germany and with recent epidemic outbreak isolates from Milan, Italy, the identified isolates showed close relatedness with the epidemic Italian strains from Milan in 3 of 4 cases. In contrast, no direct relationship to the historic German isolates was found. Antibiotic susceptibility testing revealed resistance to moxifloxacin among the Italian and the German outbreak strains, while this resistance pattern was absent in most historic German isolates. Follow-up investigations in the outbreak hospitals elucidated continued low-level spreading of RT018 isolates for a period of at least two months, despite strict application of hand hygiene and infection prevention strategies, including early diagnosis of patients with diarrhoea, single room isolation of patients with symptomatic CDI and contact precautions. Discussion: The current investigation shows that the epidemic Italian C. difficile RT018 strains have reached southern Germany and might potentially spread further within Europe. Molecular subtyping using a combination of ribotyping and MLVA proved to be a powerful tool for rapid outbreak investigations.",F Berger and S GfrÌ¦rer and S Becker and R Baldan and M Cirillo and A Nimmesgern and M Herrmann and B GÌ_rtner and L {Von MÌ_ller},1618-0607,International Journal of Medical Microbiology,"Clostridium difficile infection,Germany,Italy,antibiotic sensitivity,antigen detection,capillary electrophoresis,clinical article,clonal variation,consultation,doctor patient relation,drug resistance,early diagnosis,epidemic,feces culture,follow up,hospital hygiene,human,infection prevention,moxifloxacin,patient care,polymerase chain reaction,ribotyping,variable number of tandem repeat",40--41,{Changing epidemiology of Clostridium difficile in Europe: Experiences from an unexpected ribotype 018 outbreak in southern Germany},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l614104853 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmm.2016.11.008 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=16180607{\&}id=doi:10.1016{\%}2fj.ijmm.2016.11.008{\&}atitle=changing+epi,306,2016,8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,yes,brooke,maybe,allison,allison,zach_4,no,zm_4.csv,could not find full-text,NA,NA,no,journal

During the monsoon season, small sporadic clusters of cholera cases are reported on an annual basis in Karnataka, India. During the monsoons of 2013, there was a cholera outbreak in Badami, a remote area of Bagalkot district in Karnataka. The multi-drug-resistant Vibrio cholerae O1 serotype Ogawa was found to be responsible for this outbreak. On 5 August 2013, a 30-year-old woman presented with severe dehydration and watery diarrhea at the Aganwadi Health Centre in Badami. A total of 49 suspected cholera cases were reported, with an attack rate of 3.5{\%}. The V. cholerae isolates exhibited resistance to a wide range of drugs, including ampicillin, co-trimoxazole, nitrofurantoin, carbenicillin, and third generation cephalosporins, and showed reduced susceptibility to third generation fluoroquinolones. All of the cephalosporin-resistant V. cholerae strains produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. All V. cholerae O1 isolates harbored virulent genes (ctxA, ctxB, tcpA El Tor, Tox S, VPI, ToxT, ToxR, ToxRS, ace, zot, and tcpP) and were found to be genetically similar as determined by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA fingerprinting assay.

Methods: The isolates were identified to species level by MALDITOF MS. Antibiotic susceptibilities were determined by disk diffusion, VITEK2, and microdilution MIC determination. ESBL, AmpC and carbapenemase were analyzed by PCR-sequencing. Purified plasmids were electroporated in recipient TOP10 E. coli and their InC groups were determined. The isolates were typed by PFGE and MLST. Results: In 2010, 5 NDM-producing isolates (2 E. coli, 1 K. pneumoniae, 1 M. morganii, 1 E. cloacae) were identified in Belgium in 3 patients admitted to different hospitals. Isolates were recovered upon admission from necrotic wound infection, respiratory and fecal samples. One patient died from severe sepsis while two others were colonized. Patients were transferred from Pakistan, Montenegro and Kosovo. Enforced barrier precautions were applied and no secondary nosocomial outbreaks did occur. The E. coli isolates from 2 patients were genetically distinct by PFGE and harbored different MLST sequence types (ST101 and ST782). The K. pneumoniae presented a ST15 type (close to ST14)involved in the spread of CTX-M-15 producing K. pneumoniae. All isolates were extensively resistant and displayed a synergy between imipenem and EDTA. MICs against meropenem/imipenem/doripenem ranged from ä_1 to 8 mg/L while MIC against ertapenem ranged between 4 and 16 mg/L. NDM-1 was borne on 1 IncFI, 1 IncA/C and 1 none typable plasmid. NDM-1 in M. morganii and in E. cloacae could not be transferred in recipient cells suggesting a chromosome location or very high size plasmid. In E. coli TOP10, NDM-1 confers MICs ä_1 mg/L against all carbapenems. In addition, multiple resistance genes were associated with NDM-1 on the same or on different plasmids including CMY-16, CMY- 58, CTX-M-15, SHV-12, TEM-1, OXA-30, OXA-9, RmtB, ArmA, QnrA and QnrB. Conclusion: NDM-1 is rapidly spreading worldwide mostly from the Indian subcontinent. This is the first characterization of NDM-1- producing isolates in Belgium, two being isolated from patients with no link with the Indian subcontinent but who received hospital care in Balkan countries.

The aim of this study is to describe the emergence and spread of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (CRAB) isolates in hospitalized patients. From March to November 2009, multidrug-resistant CRAB isolates were obtained from 21 patients hospitalized in different wards (mostly ICUs). Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by using the Etest method. Carbapenem and aminoglycoside resistance determinants were studied by PCR and sequencing. Genetic relatedness was investigated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multiplex PCR identification of sequence groups. Clinical records of patients were examined retrospectively. CRAB isolates were consistently resistant to multiple drugs including fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides, whereas they retained a susceptibility to colistin. Molecular analysis revealed that 19 of the 21 CRAB isolates belonged to a single clone producing both the carbapenemase OXA-23 and the 16S rRNA methylase ArmA. Based on clinical data, the patients included in the study were classified as infected (n = 13) or colonized (n = 8). Colistin alone or in combination with ampicillin-sulbactam was administered to 11 of the 13 infected patients. A complete or partial response was obtained in eight cases, whereas a failure to respond was observed in one patient and a relapse was observed in two patients. An A. baumannii clone producing both OXA-23 and ArmA has been identified as an emerging and rapidly spreading pathogen. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the ArmA enzyme in A. baumannii in Italy and is the first report of hospital dissemination of A. baumannii carrying both blaOXA-23 and armA genes. {\textcopyright} 2012 SGM.",G Brigante and R Migliavacca and S Bramati and E Motta and E Nucleo and M Manenti and G Migliorino and L Pagani and F Luzzaro and F E Vigano and F E ViganÌ_,0022-2615,Journal of Medical Microbiology,",*Drug Resistance,80 and over,Acinetobacter Infections/*epidemiology/*microbiolo,Acinetobacter baumannii,Acinetobacter baumannii/*classification/*enzymolog,Acinetobacter infection,Adult,Aged,Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology,ArmA gene,Bacterial,Bacterial Proteins/*genetics,Child,Cluster Analysis,Cross Infection/epidemiology/microbiology,Electrophoresis,Female,Gel,Genotype,Humans,Italy/epidemiology,Male,Methyltransferases/*genetics,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Middle Aged,Molecular Epidemiology,Molecular Typing,Multiple,OXA 23 gene,Polymerase Chain Reaction,Preschool,Pulsed-Field,RNA 16S,RNA methyltransferase,adult,aged,amikacin,aminoglycoside antibiotic agent,antibiotic resistance,antibiotic sensitivity,article,aztreonam,bacterial colonization,bacterial gene,bacterium isolate,beta-Lactamases/*genetics,carbapenemase,cefepime,cefotaxime,ceftazidime,ciprofloxacin,clinical article,clone,colistin,controlled study,epsilometer test,female,gene expression,gene identification,gene sequence,gentamicin,human,imipenem,levofloxacin,male,medical record review,meropenem,minimum inhibitory concentration,molecular epidemiology,multidrug resistance,multiplex polymerase chain reaction,nonhuman,piperacillin plus tazobactam,polymerase chain reaction,priority journal,pulsed field gel electrophoresis,purification,quinoline derived antiinfective agent,sultamicillin,tigecycline,treatment outcome,treatment response",653--661,{Emergence and spread of a multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii clone producing both the carbapenemase OXA-23 and the 16s rRNA methylase ArmA},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l364638716 http://dx.doi.org/10.1099/jmm.0.040980-0 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=00222615{\&}id=doi:10.1099{\%}2fjmm.0.040980-0{\&}atitle=emergence+and+spread,61,2012,pt 5,"from duplicate 2 (emergence and spread of a multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii clone producing both the carbapenemase oxa-23 and the 16s rrna methylase arma - brigante, g; migliavacca, r; bramati, s; motta, e; nucleo, e; manenti, m; migliorino, g; pagani, l; luzzaro, f; vigano, f e)1473-5644brigante, giocondamigliavacca, robertabramati, simonemotta, eleonoranucleo, elisabettamanenti, monicamigliorino, guglielmopagani, lauraluzzaro, francescovigano, franco egidiojournal articleenglandj med microbiol. 2012 may;61(pt 5):653-61. doi: 10.1099/jmm.0.040980-0. epub 2012 jan 26.",10.1099/jmm.0.040980-0,1/28/12,eng,22282459,yes,brooke,yes,ayomide,ayomide,zach_4,yes,zm_4.csv,NA,NA,zm_4_1.mex,yes,journal

Even if widespread antibiotic therapy and modern imaging technologies combined with minimally invasive techniques have improved the outcome in patients with brain abscesses, this is counterbalanced by an increasing population of immunocompromised patients. Basal ganglia, thalamic, brainstem or multiple abscesses are usually of hematogenous origin with an underlying source of infection which can include congenital heart disease, thoracic sepsis or, less frequently, an odontogenic or otogenic source. However, no evident foci of sepsis or predisposing factors may be found. Only a few studies are reported in the literature, because midline abscesses are usually included in studies dealing on the treatment of abscesses in general. Different treatment options and the timing of treatment are described. We report our experience in 3 consecutive cases of thalamic abscess, treated by stereotactic puncture as the first step, followed by histological analysis, external drainage and targeted intrathecal and systemic antibiotic therapy. Deep-seated abscesses seem to behave differently as they are associated with an increased risk of intraventricular rupture and antibiotic resistance, a fact which justifies a more aggressive and immediate surgical treatment.

3489,maybe,charalambakis2012,article,"Objectives: Accurate detection of production or co-production of class A KPC and class B metallo -beta-lactamase (MBL) Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolates. Methods: From November 2010 - November 2011, 30 K. pneumoniae ICU blood isolates with reduced susceptibility to carbapenemes (MIC {\textgreater} 1 $\mu$g/mL) were detected. Antibiotic susceptibility to several antibiotics was estimated by Kirby-Bauer method, MIC determination by automated system (Phoenix, BD) and E-test (Biomerieux SA, France), according to CLSI standards. The isolates were submitted to phenotypic combined disk test by both EDTA and boronic acid - meropenem for the differentiation of KPC and MBL enzymes. Genotypic confirmation for the presence of carbapenemase genes was carried out by PCR and molecular typing was performed by PFGE in 11 representative isolates. Results: The clinical isolates were mulltidrug resistant with an MIC range to meropenem ({\textless}1 to ä´2), while colistin (ä_0.5-ä´4), gentamicin (2-8), tigecycline (ä_2-ä´8) and fosfomycin (ä_16-128) were the most active agents. Twenty isolates produced KPC carbapenemases, seven isolates only VIM while four produced both KPC and VIM carbapenemases. Five isolates produced ESBL additionally. Pulsed field typing gathered five isolates into subtype A1 and one in subtype A2, which is the most common type producing KPC-2 in Greece. Three isolates were included in sybtype B, the second most common type of KPC in Greece which produced both KPC and VIM . Two isolates were not genetically related. Conclusion: Dissemination of bla KPC is mainly due to certain K. pneumoniae types. Fosfomycin, colistin and tigecyclin remain among the therapeutic options for KPC infections.

Both Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolates (Kpn922 and Kpn9599) were resistant to meropenem and imipenem and were subjected to additional antibiotic susceptibility testing. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequence analyses were used to characterize bacterial carbapenemase resistance genes, extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, plasmid-mediated AmpC enzymes, quinolone resistance, and 16s RNA methylase. Genetic relatedness was determined using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Plasmids were analyzed by S1-PFGE and Southern blot. RESULTS: PCR analyses revealed that the Kpn922 isolate carried blaNDM-1, blaIMP-4, blaTEM-1, and blaSHV-1 genes, while Kpn9599 carried blaNDM-1, blaIMP-4, blaTEM-1, and blaSHV-12 genes. MLST determined that the two isolates were ST1043 and ST571 sequence types. Southern blot analyses revealed that metallo-beta-lactamase genes were plasmid borne in both isolates.

Resistance to carbapenems arises through either acquisition of resistance genes (IMP, NDM-1, KPC, OXA) or production of extended spectrum beta-lactamase with alteration of porin expression. In Singapore, there has been an increase in CRE since 2010. The primary objective of this retrospective case-case-control study is to identify and compare risk factors for colonization with NCP CRE and CP CRE. Methods {\&} Materials: Patients admitted between September 2010 and July 2013 to Tan Tock Seng Hospital, a teaching hospital in Singapore, were included. We selected three groups of subjects. Case 1: patients who had NCP CRE gut colonization. Case 2: patients who had CP CRE gut colonization. Control: Patients who were screened negative for CRE. Demographic, clinical, microbiological data and antibiotic usage in preceding 90 days were collected from electronic medical records. Statistical analysis was done using STATA 12.0. Results: 1934 patients were screened for CRE, of which a total of 17 patients colonized with NCP CRE and 15 patients with CP CRE (13 NDM-1 and 2 OXA-48) were compared with 60 randomly selected control patients. Of the NCP CRE, 9 were Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1 was Enterobacter cloacae, 1 was Enterobacter aerogenes and 6 were not speciated. Of the CP CRE, 7 were Klebsiella pneumoniae, 4 were Escherichia coli and 4 were Enterobacter cloacae. There was no significant difference in age, sex and Charlson index between cases and controls. Duration of fluoroquinolone and carbapenem exposure was significantly longer for NCP CRE compared to controls: fluoroquinolone-(3.88å±6.47 vs 1.00å±.80; OR, 1.16; 95{\%} CI, 1.02 - 1.32; P = 0.02) and carbapenems- (5.29å±7.70 vs 1.62å±5.52; OR, 1.08; 95{\%} CI, 1.00 - 1.17; P = 0.05). Of note, antibiotic exposure in the preceding 90 days was not associated with CP CRE colonization. Conclusion: While preceding antibiotic use was a risk factor for NCP CRE colonization, it was not found to be a risk factor in CP CRE colonization.

3798,maybe,chironna2011,article,"OBJECTIVES: Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a frequent cause of human lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) for which macrolides are the treatment of choice. The aim of this study was to determine the rate of macrolide resistance and to subtype M. pneumoniae strains in Italy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: During an outbreak of M. pneumoniae infections in southern Italy in 2010, 48 clinical specimens from 43 paediatric patients hospitalized for LRTIs were analysed for macrolide resistance. The mutations associated with resistance (A2063G and A2064G) and M. pneumoniae subtypes were detected by sequencing the targeted domain V region of the 23S rRNA gene and a region in the MPN528a gene, respectively. RESULTS: Macrolide resistance genotypes were detected in 11 (26{\%}) of the 43 M. pneumoniae-positive children. The A2063G mutation was identified in seven patients and the A2064G mutation was identified in the remaining four. Upon admission, the isolates from three patients showed a susceptible genotype but subsequently acquired the A2063G mutation. Genotyping revealed M. pneumoniae subtype 1 in 33 of 40 sequenced strains and subtype 2 in the remaining 7. There was no association between macrolide resistance or susceptibility and the M. pneumoniae subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of macrolide resistance among M. pneumoniae strains in Italy. Our findings indicate an unexpected high prevalence of macrolide resistance genotypes in children, and so macrolide resistance should be carefully considered in patients who do not respond appropriately to antibiotic treatment. The epidemiological monitoring of macrolide resistance has become necessary in Italy and in the rest of Europe.",M Chironna and A Sallustio and S Esposito and M Perulli and I Chinellato and C {Di Bari} and M Quarto and F Cardinale,0305-7453,J Antimicrob Chemother,"*Disease Outbreaks,*Drug Resistance, Bacterial,Adolescent,Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology,Bacterial Typing Techniques,Child,Child, Preschool,Female,Genotype,Humans,Infant,Italy/epidemiology,Macrolides/*pharmacology,Male,Mycoplasma pneumoniae/*drug effects/isolation {\&} pu,Pneumonia, Mycoplasma/*epidemiology/*microbiology,Point Mutation,RNA, Bacterial/genetics,RNA, Ribosomal, 23S/genetics,Sequence Analysis, DNA",734--737,{Emergence of macrolide-resistant strains during an outbreak of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections in children},NA,66,2011,4,"1460-2091chironna, msallustio, aesposito, sperulli, mchinellato, idi bari, cquarto, mcardinale, fjournal articleresearch support, non-u.s. gov'tenglandj antimicrob chemother. 2011 apr;66(4):734-7. doi: 10.1093/jac/dkr003. epub 2011 jan 31.",10.1093/jac/dkr003,3/12/11,eng,21393214,maybe,cale,no,ayomide,allison,zach_4,yes,zm_4.csv,NA,NA,zm_4_1.mex,yes,journal
3927,yes,chua2014,article,"A previously well 66-year-old man was repatriated from Athens, Greece, to the Austin Hospital for ongoing management after a protracted hospital admission for an ischiorectal abscess secondary to perforated diverticulitis. This was complicated by faeculent peritonitis, multiple intra-abdominal abscesses and necrotising fasciitis of the abdominal wall. These complex problems required multiple laparotomies to drain and debride the abscesses, management of an open abdomen with vacuum-assisted closure dressings, and the formation of a loop sigmoidostomy. He also developed a grade IV sacral pressure ulcer with underlying sacral osteomyelitis. Organisms isolated from the intra-abdominal collections included carbapenemresistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and a carbapenemaseproducing Klebsiella pneumoniae (blaKPC). Due to the complexity of the patient's illness, he had spent 93 days in hospital in Greece, predominantly in intensive care, with three interhospital transfers within Greece before repatriation to Australia. Antibiotics administered in Greece included tigecycline, colistin, fosfomycin, vancomycin, clindamycin and anidulafungin. As the patient had multiple resistant organisms, detailed infection control plans were made before his arrival at the Austin Hospital. This included placement in a single room with a dedicated ensuite bathroom, daily bleach cleaning of the room,1 no use of shared equipment, enforcement of strict contact precautions including gowns and gloves, and hand hygiene. Patient movement was severely restricted and only two visitors were allowed at any one time. Unfortunately, the patient developed a new intra-abdominal collection, bowel obstruction and abdominal sepsis. This required surgical intervention, including extensive division of adhesions, resection of the sigmoid and part of the descending colon, retroperitoneal enteric fistula repair and retroperitoneal abscess drainage. An end colostomy and loop ileostomy were formed. This procedure resulted in faecal continence and therefore control of the perianal source of multidrug-resistant organisms. Culture of the intra-abdominal abscess grew mixed enteric flora including Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp, Candida glabrata and K. pneumoniae. The latter organism was resistant to multiple drugs, including meropenem, due to the production of K. pneumoniae carbapenemase-2 (blaKPC-2) (Patient 1, Box). The same organism was found in his faeces. A blaKPC-2-producing K. pneumoniae was also isolated from a sacral ulcer swab, but the susceptibility profile was slightly different. This isolate was also resistant to all aminoglycosides, including gentamicin and amikacin, and demonstrated an increased minimum inhibitory concentration to colistin (Box). The patient's antibiotic treatment included meropenem, tigecycline, colistin and caspofungin for 6 weeks, and his sacral ulcer was treated with a vacuum-assisted closure dressing. He stayed at the Austin Hospital for 101 days before being discharged home. Six months later, the patient re-presented to the Austin Hospital with urosepsis. The causative organism, isolated in both urine and blood, was E. coli (Box). Strikingly, the organism was found to be a blaKPC-2-producing strain, suggesting interspecies transfer of this mobile genetic element between K. pneumoniae and E. coli. Unlike the K. pneumoniae, this isolate was susceptible to ciprofloxacin, and the patient was successfully treated with this antibiotic. During this second admission, the same infection control measures were enforced. At follow-up 6 months later, the patient remained well. There was no documented inhospital transmission of blaKPC-2, suggesting the infection control measures employed were successful.",K Y L Chua and M {Lindsay Grayson} and A N Burgess and J Y H Lee and B P Howden,"0025-729x1326-5377",Medical Journal of Australia,"Candida glabrata,Citrobacter,Enterococcus faecium,Escherichia coli,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Pseudomonas aeruginosa,abdominal abscess,aged,amikacin,anidulafungin,antibiotic resistance,article,bacterial infection,caspofungin,ciprofloxacin,clindamycin,clinical article,colistin,colostomy,diverticulitis,fosfomycin,gentamicin,human,ileostomy,intestine obstruction,laparotomy,male,meropenem,minimum inhibitory concentration,multidrug resistance,multiplex polymerase chain reaction,osteomyelitis,sepsis,tigecycline,travel,urosepsis,vancomycin",116--118,{The growing burden of multidrugresistant infections among returned Australian travellers},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l372288081 http://dx.doi.org/10.5694/mja13.10592 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=0025729x{\&}id=doi:10.5694{\%}2fmja13.10592{\&}atitle=the+growing+burden+of+mult,200,2014,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,yes,brooke,yes,nchedo,nchedo,zach_4,yes,zm_4.csv,NA,NA,zm_4_1.mex,yes,journal
4187,maybe,consales2011,article,"Purpose: Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MRAB) is an emerging cause of intensive care unit (ICU) outbreaks. Patients are the main reservoirs, inducing cross transmission. We describe an MRAB outbreak that occurred in the Prato Hospital ICU in June to August 2009. Materials and Methods: The ICU consists of 2 separated 4-bed rooms (rooms A and B). The MRAB-positive patients were included in our study. During the outbreak, infection control measures were enhanced; patients and environmental screenings were performed. A 6-month follow-up was carried out. Results: Four of 26 patients admitted during the outbreak were MRAB positive. All patients were located in room A; no case was detected in room B either in the hospital or during the follow-up. Management included closure to new admissions, reinforcement of infection control measures, patient and environmental screenings, discharge of room B MRAB-negative patients for at least 5 days after the first case identification. All isolates were carbapenems resistant and tigecycline and colistin susceptible. All patients received tigecycline: 2 were successfully treated, 1 died because of preexisting illness, and 1 developed resistance and recovered after colistin therapy. Conclusions: Enhanced infection control measures and adequate antibiotic strategy limited the outbreak. Tigecycline allowed rapid recovery. Nevertheless, resistance ensued; so colistin remained the only therapeutic option. However, pan-drug resistance has been reported. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.",G Consales and E Gramigni and L Zamidei and D Bettocchi and A R {De Gaudio},"0883-94411557-8615",Journal of Critical Care,",*Drug Resistance,Acinetobacter Infections/*drug therapy/epidemiolog,Acinetobacter baumannii/*drug effects/isolation {\&},Acinetobacter infection,Aged,Anti-Infective Agents/*therapeutic use,Bacterial,Colistin/therapeutic use,Cross Infection/*drug therapy/epidemiology/microbi,Disease Outbreaks/*prevention {\&} control,Female,Humans,Infection Control/methods,Intensive Care Units/*organization {\&} administratio,Italy,Italy/epidemiology,Male,Middle Aged,Minocycline/analogs {\&} derivatives/therapeutic use,Multiple,Treatment Outcome,adult,ampicillin,antibiotic agent,antibiotic resistance,antibiotic sensitivity,antiinfective agent,article,bacterium isolation,carbapenem,cefepime,cefotaxime,ceftazidime,ceftriaxone,clinical article,colistin,controlled study,death,environmental factor,epidemic,female,follow up,gentamicin,hospital admission,hospital discharge,human,imipenem,infection control,intensive care unit,levofloxacin,male,meropenem,methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus infect,metronidazole,minimum inhibitory concentration,multidrug resistance,patient assessment,piperacillin plus tazobactam,pneumonia,reinforcement,rifampicin,teicoplanin,tigecycline,vancomycin",453--459,{A multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii outbreak in intensive care unit: Antimicrobial and organizational strategies},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l51331827 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcrc.2010.12.016 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=08839441{\&}id=doi:10.1016{\%}2fj.jcrc.2010.12.016{\&}atitle=a+multidrug-r,26,2011,5,"from duplicate 2 (a multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii outbreak in intensive care unit: antimicrobial and organizational strategies - consales, g; gramigni, e; zamidei, l; bettocchi, d; de gaudio, a r)1557-8615consales, guglielmogramigni, elenazamidei, luciabettocchi, danielade gaudio, angelo raffaelejournal articleunited statesj crit care. 2011 oct;26(5):453-9. doi: 10.1016/j.jcrc.2010.12.016. epub 2011 mar 24.",10.1016/j.jcrc.2010.12.016,3/29/11,eng,21439763,yes,allison,maybe,mushtaq,mushtaq,zach_4,yes,zm_4.csv,NA,NA,zm_4_1.mex,yes,journal

This study reports the emergence of carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae strains in Brescia Civic Hospital, Italy. Different samples, collected from April 2012 to February 2013, showed that 29 patients presented infections from multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae and three of these patients were intestinal carriers. In total, 40 carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae strains were isolated from multiple specimens of these patients. In 39 out of 40 samples, we identified the blaKPC-3 carbapenemase gene variant responsible for bacterial carbapenem resistance. The DiversiLab analysis showed four different genetic patterns within multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates, with pattern 1 and 2 including 95{\%} of the bacterial strains. Carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae strains belonging to patterns 1 and 2 were also detected in the intestinal tract of the three asymptomatic carriers. Moreover, isolation of the same strains in other body sites of the same patients and in bronchial fluid of a non-colonized patient in the same ward indicates an initial dissemination of this pathogen.

A 58 year-old man was admitted to the Saint Joseph Hospital-Raymond and Aida Najjar polyclinic in Beirut on July 17, 2007 to undergo surgery for a moderately differentiated colonic adenocarcinoma (T3N0). Following several discharges and re-admissions, an extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Escherichia coli susceptible to imipenem was isolated. The patient was put on imipenem and metronidazole. Three weeks later, imipenem (IMP) resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae was isolated. Methods and results. The antimicrobial susceptibility profile of the imipenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae strain and related minimum inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics were determined. Hydrolysis of IMP was evaluated and production of metallo-$\beta$-lactamase (MBL) was detected by a double disk-synergy test, ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) inhibited the imipenemase activity, whereas clavulanate and tazobaetam did not, this suggesting the production of a metallo-$\beta$-lactamase. Isoelectric focusing analysis was performed and indicated the presence of a cefotaximase (blaCTX-M-15). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used and detected the presence of blaIMP-1 and blaCTX-M genes. Conclusions.

4717,yes,david2008,article,"AIM OF THE STUDY: This retrospective study was conducted in order to characterize mechanisms of resistance to beta-lactams and clonality of 24 isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These strains were isolated from patients hospitalized in Rouen University Hospital between August 2004 and December 2006 and were resistant to cefepime and/or ceftazidime (PMR) by a mechanism not only related to overproduction of the cephalosporinase. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical strains of PMR were characterized by conventional biochemical methods, antibiotic susceptibility testing by disk diffusion in agar with or without cloxacillin and RAPD for genetic comparison. Identification of beta-lactamase was performed by PCR amplification followed by sequencing of bla genes. RESULTS: All strains produced the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) TEM-116. Epidemiological study identified eight unrelated strains, eight related strains originating from a single unit, three related strains isolated in different wards and five related strains coproducing TEM-116 and SHV-2a but isolated in different units. Detection of ESBL in these strains was difficult due to a low level of ESBL production. CONCLUSION: This is the first report of TEM-116 in France in 24 strains of P. aeruginosa and its association with SHV-2a in five cases. SHV-2a has been described in P. aeruginosa in France but not TEM-116 which was recently reported in this species, in China and in Netherlands (in a strain coproducing SHV-12).

The first South African NDM-1 case was reported in September 2011. We describe a case-control study of an NDM-1 producing Enterobacteriaceae outbreak which occurred in a 322- bed South African hospital and identify risk factors associated with invasive disease and mortality. Methods {\&} Materials: All reported NDM-1 positive patients (n = 97) identified between 1 June 2011 and 31 October 2012 were reviewed. The inclusion criteria was all patients admitted during the study period in whom NDM-1 producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates causing invasive disease were identified at least 48 hours after admission (n = 41). Controls (n = 78) were randomly selected and matched for age, sex, date of hospital admission, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Bivariate conditional logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for NDM-1 invasive disease as well as death. A forward multivariate conditional logistic regression model was utilised to identify significant predictors for NDM-1 invasive disease and death. Results: The epidemic-curve showed a propagating pattern, with most cases being detected during or subsequent to ICU admission. Cases had longer mean hospital (27.8 days vs 11.9 days) and ICU stays (31.0 days vs 7.3 days) than controls. The crude in-hospital mortality of cases was significantly higher than controls (OR 13.02; 95{\%} CI: 2.98 - 56.76).

5416,yes,dora2008,article,"Introduction: Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumanii are important nosocomial pathogens with wide intrinsic resistance. However, due to the dissemination of the acquired resistance mechanisms, such as extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) and metallo beta-lactamase (MBL) production, multidrug resistant strains have been isolated more often. Case presentation: We report a case of a Hungarian tourist, who was initially hospitalized in Egypt and later transferred to Hungary. On the day of admission PER-1-producing P. aeruginosa, PER-1 producing A. baumannii, SHV-5-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae and VIM-2-producing P. aeruginosa isolates were subcultured from the patient's samples in Hungary. Comparing the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns of the P. aeruginosa strains from the patient to the P. aeruginosa strains occurring in this hospital, we can state that the PER-1-producing P. aeruginosa and VIM-2-producing P. aeruginosa had external origin. Conclusion: This is the first report of PER-1-producing P. aeruginosa, and PER-1-producing A. baumanii strains in Hungary. This case highlights the importance of spreading of the beta-lactamase-mediated resistance mechanisms between countries and continents, showing the importance of careful screening and the isolation of patients arriving from a different country. {\textcopyright} 2008 Szab{\'{o}} et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",S Dora and J SzentandrÌÁssy and Z JuhÌÁsz and K Katona and K Nagy and L RÌ_kusz,1476-0711,Annals of Clinical Microbiology and Antimicrobials,"Acinetobacter baumannii,Egypt,Enterococcus faecalis,Hungary,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Pseudomonas aeruginosa,Pseudomonas extended resistance 1 protein,adult,amikacin,aminoglycoside,antibiotic resistance,antibiotic sensitivity,article,aztreonam,bacterial strain,bacterium culture,bacterium detection,bacterium isolate,beta lactamase SHV,beta lactamase SHV 5,burn,carbapenem,case report,cefepime,cefotaxime,ceftazidime,ceftriaxone,cephalosporin,ciprofloxacin,clavulanic acid,edetic acid,extended spectrum beta lactamase,gentamicin,human,imipenem,male,meropenem,metallo beta lactamase,methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus,minimum inhibitory concentration,netilmicin,nonhuman,piperacillin plus tazobactam,protein VIM 2,pulsed field gel electrophoresis,sepsis,tobramycin,vancomycin",NA,"{Imported PER-1 producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa, PER-1 producing Acinetobacter baumanii and VIM-2-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains in Hungary}",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l351877807 http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1476-0711-7-12 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=14760711{\&}id=doi:10.1186{\%}2f1476-0711-7-12{\&}atitle=imported+per-1+produ,7,2008,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,yes,brooke,yes,erica,erica,zach_4,yes,zm_4.csv,NA,NA,zm_4_1.mex,yes,journal

But fluoroquinolone (FQ) resistance remains uncommon in literature, without available data on resistance mechanisms. CASE REPORT: For the first time, a case of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was described in a 78-year-old immunocompetent patient due to a multidrug-resistant Capnocytophaga gingivalis isolate with significant microbiological finding. C.gingivalis acquired resistance to third generation cephalosporins (blaCfxA3 gene), MLS (erm(F) gene), and fluoroquinolones. Genetics of the resistance, unknown as regards fluoroquinolone, was investigated and a substitution in QRDR of GyrA was described (Gly80Asn substitution) for the first time in the Capnocytophaga genus. LITERATURE REVIEW: A comprehensive literature review of Capnocytophaga spp. extra-oral infection was conducted. Including the present report, on 43 cases, 7 isolates were BL-resistant (17{\%}), 4 isolates were MLS-resistant (9.5{\%}) and 4 isolates were FQ-resistant (9.5{\%}). The studied clinical isolate of C.gingivalis was the only one to combine resistance to the three groups of antibiotics BL, MLS and FQ. Four cases of Capnocytophaga lung infection were reported, including three infections involving C. gingivalis (two FQ resistant) and one involving C. sputigena.

6591,maybe,fouad2013,article,"BACKGROUND: Healthcare-associated infections are a worldwide threat to hospitalized patients, especially those in intensive care units. The prevalence of these infections in Egypt, and their antimicrobial resistance patterns and mechanisms, were investigated in this study. METHODS: A total of 547 cases of healthcare-associated infections were investigated. Causative agents were identified and antimicrobial susceptibility determined. Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii isolates were further investigated for their resistance mechanism via the modified Hodge test, inhibitor-potentiated disk diffusion test, synergy with carbonyl cyanide chlorophenylhydrazone, and PCR. Moreover, clonal linkage was examined via enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC)-PCR. RESULTS: Klebsiella spp was the most prevalent species in the isolates examined (217; 40{\%}). Although A. baumannii represented only 10{\%} of the total isolates, it showed the highest percentage of carbapenem resistance (74{\%}).

Introduced in 2000, linezolid (LZD) has become an important antibiotic, used in nearly seventy countries worldwide to treat infections caused by Gram-positive pathogens such as meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species along with vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Resistance to LZD in clinical settings remains rare. Here, we report the emergence of meticillin resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE) clinical isolates from two voluntary general acute hospitals exhibiting higher than typically reported levels of LZD resistance (MIC{\textgreater}256 mug/ml). The MRSE ST-2 clone isolated from eight patients (2010-2011) not only possessed resistance-conferring mutations such as G2576T in domain V of 23S rRNA gene (as determined by HRM-PCR analysis) and R172C substitution in the ribosomal protein L3, but also carried the cfr gene (the only known transmissible mechanism of LZD resistance). All isolates possessed several key biofilm-associated genes (such as icaA, icaD, aap and atlE) and resistance to multiple clinically significant antibiotics was recorded.

6938,yes,garcia-garrote2014,article,"OBJECTIVES: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains carrying the mecC gene have been reported from humans and animals from several European countries, but never from Spain. We describe the first isolates of mecC-positive MRSA of human origin collected in Spain and report a fatal case of bacteraemia. METHODS: Isolates were tested for phenotypic resistance using cefoxitin, tested for the mecA/mecC genes and toxin genes by PCR, and typed by staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec), PFGE, spa, multilocus sequence typing and agr. RESULTS: During 2008-13 five MRSA isolates showing resistance to cefoxitin and carrying the mecC gene were recovered at one hospital in Spain. In a review of 5505 S. aureus strains received at the Spanish National Reference Centre for Staphylococci from the same period, we found two additional mecC-positive isolates. The isolates were recovered from blood (two), wounds (two), joint fluid (one), urine (one) and a nasal swab (one). All MRSA were mecA negative, presented SCCmecXI, belonged to agr group III and to clonal complex 130, and were negative for the production of the toxin genes tst1, eta, etb, etd and Panton-Valentine leucocidin. Six isolates belonged to spa type t843 (ST130 and ST1945, where ST stands for sequence type) and one to spa type t6220 (ST1945). One patient with mecC-positive MRSA sepsis died in the emergency department.

7970,maybe,gupta2009f,article,"BACKGROUND {\&} OBJECTIVE: Enteric fever is a major public health problem in India. It is classically caused by Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi. Salmonella enterica serotype Paratyphi A which had been reported less frequently from cases of enteric fever has shown an increasing trend since 1996 in India. There is also variation in the antimicrobial susceptibility of Salmonella Paratyphi A from different parts of the country. An attempt is therefore made to study the rate of isolation and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of Salmonella Paratyphi A from cases of enteric fever coming to a tertiary care hospital at Chandigarh. METHODS: The blood samples of patients suspected of having enteric fever and admitted to Government Medical College and Hospital, Chandigarh, from January 2006 to April 2007 (11,240) were processed by conventional methods. Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. The minimum inhibitory concentration to two antibiotics- ciprofloxacin and chloramphenicol was determined by agar dilution technique. Simultaneously, retrospective analysis was done from January 2003-December 2005 to study any difference in the incidence and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of Salmonella Paratyphi A among enteric fever patients. RESULTS: Of 305 total isolates, 231 were S. Typhi and 84 S. Paratyphi A rise. The number of Salmonella Paratyphi A cases rose from 27 in 2006 (34.18{\%}) to 13 (40.63{\%}) in four months of 2007. All were sensitive to ciprofloxacin and cefotaxime but MIC to ciprofloxacin was raised (0.125-0.5 microg/ml). Resistance to nalidixic acid was 92.5 per cent. Chloramphenicol sensitivity re-emerged with 90 per cent isolates sensitive to it while sensitivity to ampicillin dropped (72.5{\%}) as compared to previous years. Only one isolate was multi-drug resistant. INTERPRETATION {\&} CONCLUSION: The present study conferencing Salmonella Paratyphi A as the rapidly emerging pathogen of enteric fever.

Studying annual trends in antibiotic susceptibility and genetic patterns of H. influenzae beta-lactam resistance, we isolated 122 strains from the adult respiratory tract in 2007, determined MIC for different antibiotics, and analyzed TEM-1 beta-lactamase resistant genes and ftsI encoding PBP3 mutation compared to results in 2005 and 2007. We found that ABPC-susceptible strains with MIC {\textless}1 microg/mL (BLNAS) accounted for 71.0{\%}, ABPC-resistant strains with MIC exceeding 2 microg/mL without beta-lactamase activity (BLNAR) for 25.3{\%}, and beta-lactamase-positive strains (BLP) for 3.7{\%}. The BLNAS ratio showed no significant change from 2002 and 2005. The BLP ratio decreased from those in 2002 and 2005. Genetic studies of resistant genes showed that gBLNAS with no resistant genes had increased in the last five years. The ratio of all strains with PBP3 mutation (gBLNAR and gLow-BLNAR) remained constant from 2002 to 2007. The proportion of gBLNAR with two PBP3 mutations had increased, however, while gLow-BLNAR with one mutation had decreased. LVFX showed constant strong antimicrobial potency for all mutation groups. Among beta-lactam antibiotics, the lowest MIC90 was observed in parenteral CTRX and oral CDTR-PI use.

The resistance to carbapenems, generally very rare in Klebsiella pneumoniae strains in the Czech Republic, is predominantly caused by an alteration of the cell wall, together with a production of extendedspectrum and/or AmpC $\beta$-lactamases. At the end of 2009, the first putative KPC-producing isolates of K. pneumoniae was submitted for confirmation to the National Reference Laboratory for Antibiotics of the National Institute of Public Health in Prague. The isolates were obtained from one patient. Methods: MICs of 24 antibiotics were determined according to EUCAST recommendation. $\beta$-lactamases were identified by isoelectric focusing followed by PCR and sequencing of $\beta$-lactamase genes. The gene environment of blaKPC-2 was determined by PCR mapping and sequencing of the amplicons. Isolates were compared by PFGE after the restriction with XbaI endonuclease and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Results: The isolates of K. pneumoniae (ST258) were obtained from a wound swab, decubitus and urine from patient formerly hospitalized in a Greek hospital. The carbapenemase was identified as a KPC-2 with a gene located on Tn4401a traspozon variant. The resistance to colistin developed after 20-days long therapy with this drug, but after this single isolation, the KPC-2 producing strain disappeared. Conclusion: This is the first description of the KPC-producing K. pneumoniae in the Czech Republic in patient with a travel history in Greece - the country with an endemic KPC.

We describe here the evolution of the epidemiology of decreased carbapenem susceptibility in Enterobacteriaceae and the increasing frequency of occurrence of CPE clinical isolates in Belgium. Methods: Multidrug-resistant clinical Enterobacteriaceae isolated referred between Jan. 2007 and Dec. 2010 by Belgian laboratories to the National Reference Centre were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility by disk diffusion method according to CLSI guidelines. Isolates showing decreased susceptibility to a carbapenem (meropenem inhibition diameter {\textless}22 mm) were tested for the presence of carbapenemase encoding genes by PCR targeting blaVIM, IMP, KPC, NDM and blaOXA-48. Case data were reviewed in CPE carriers for evidence of recent travel or transfer from institution abroad. Results: The number of Enterobacteriaceae isolates with decreased susceptibility to a carbapenem increased from 8 (5{\%} of all yearly referred Enterobacteriaceae isolates), 11 (11{\%}) and 14 (11{\%}) in 2007, 2008 and 2009 respectively to 44 (47{\%}) in year 2010. Of the 506 Enterobacteriaceae isolates received over the whole study period, 31 CPE isolates were detected in 27 patients from 12 hospitals, carrying VIM-1 (n = 15), NDM-1 (n = 5), KPC-2 (n = 5)and OXA-48 (n = 6) enzymes. The majority (17/31) of the CPE isolates (including all 5 NDM-1 and 5 of 6 OXA-48 producing isolates) were recorded in 2010. K. pneumoniae represented 65{\%} (20/31) of CPE whereas all but one CPE isolates belonging to 6 other species were reported in 2010. Among the 27 patients carrying CPE, 13 had travelled and had been hospitalized in a foreign country during the three months before diagnosis, 6 had acquired CPE through probable secondary nosocomial transmission, while for 8 carriers, no clear link to imported or epidemic strains could be established. Conclusion: Enterobacteriaceae isolates with decreased susceptibility to carbapenems are increasingly reported and CPE are clearly more frequently detected in Belgium since 2010.

9489,yes,jacquier2012,article,"Objectives: Many alleles of the penicillinase TEM-1 or TEM-2 were described so far in clinical isolates. Their spectrum of resistance varies with regard to point mutations in the bla sequence, with some mutations leading to extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) and others to inhibitor-resistant TEM (IRT). These IRT enzymes can broaden their spectrum to third generation cephalosporins by the occurrence of additional mutations: they are commonly referred to as ÛÏcomplex mutant TEMÛ or CMT. If many studies have shown that modifications of the spectrum of TEM-type enzymes is driven by antibiotic selection pressure, no study has ever described a CMT derived from an IRT by in vivo selection. Methods: We describe the case of a patient hospitalized for an acute myeloid leukemia in the Haematology ward at Saint-Louis Universitary Hospital in Paris. During hospitalisation, the patient was treated with ceftazidime for a bacteremia due to an Escherichia coli strain expressing an IRT phenotype (strain EC1). After 8 days of treatment, there was no clinical improvement and new blood cultures yielded a strain of E. coli with an IRT phenotype but with resistance extended to ceftazidime (strain EC2). Results: ERIC-PCR analysis showed the clonality of the two strains. PCR-sequencing of the TEM allele from EC1 identified the mutations M69L and N276D, corresponding to the TEM-35 allele also known as IRT-4. TEM gene sequencing from EC2 identified the additional mutation R164S, which was previously reported for the TEM-158 allele already described as a CMT allele (CMT-9).

Among NA(R) strains, 61.8{\%} were sensitive, 11.1{\%} were moderately sensitive, and 23.9{\%} were resistant to ciprofloxacin (0.8{\%}, 57.4{\%}, and 37.9{\%} respectively according to revised CLSI breakpoint criteria for ciprofloxacin). Resistance to third-generation cephalosporin was found in seven (2{\%}) strains of S. enterica. CONCLUSION: Increasing rates of nalidixic acid, fluoroquinolone and azithromycin resistance among S. enterica, particularly in S. Paratyphi A strains, is of concern, as S. Paratyphi A infection is becoming increasingly common and is not prevented by current vaccinations. Our results favour use of cefexime or possibly chloramphenicol as first choice for uncomplicated enteric fever.

10069,maybe,kandasamy2013,article,"LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1: Emphasize Nocardia pseudobrasiliensis as an emerging pathogen causing disseminated infections in immunocompromised host. LEARNING OBJECTIVE 2: Recognize the importance of differentiating N. pseudobrasiliensis from N. brasiliensis and choosing appropriate antimicrobials. CASE: A 79 year old Caucasian male was admitted with multiple abscesses in the lower extremities. Patient had a history of left hand abscess for the past 1 year. Lower extremity abscesses started 6 months ago and were progressively getting worse with increasing pain. He received several courses of antibiotics with moderate relief. His past medical history was significant for Myasthenia Gravis, on prednisone therapy for the last 2 years. Vital signs were stable. On examination, patient had multiple tender swellings in the both lower extremities. Laboratory data was significant only for leucocytosis. Patient was started empirically on vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lower extremities showed multifocal complex lesions and fluid within the muscle bed without any evidence of osteomyelitis. Largest lesion measured approximately 10ÌÑ8 cm in the left biceps femoris muscle complex. Ultrasound guided drainage of large abscesses was done. The organism was identified presumptively as Actinomyces based on gram stain and colonial morphology. Vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam were discontinued and he was then started on ampicillin. Cultures later revealed the organism to be Nocardia. Genetic analyzer confirmed the species as Nocardia pseudobrasiliensis which was resistant to penicillin, cephalosporins, trimethoprime-sulfomethoxazole and sensitive to moxifloxacin and linezolid. CT chest and MRI brain did not show any disseminated abscesses. Patient was started on moxifloxacin and remarkable improvement was noted. DISCUSSION: Nocardia pseudobrasiliensis is an emerging species of Nocardia, first identified in 1996. Only few cases have been reported so far. This case emphasizes the difficulties in diagnosing Nocardia infection which may lead to inappropriate antimicrobial therapy. The distinction between Actinomyces and Nocardia species is of extreme clinical importance. On gram stain, Nocardia and Actinomyces species are morphologically indistinguishable. Nocardia species can be identified by modified acid-fast staining and their ability to grow under aerobic conditions, neither of which is a characteristic of Actinomyces. Nocardia infections range from localized cutaneous infections to invasive and disseminated disease. Nocardia brasiliensis is one of the most common species isolated in Nocardiosis. A recent study demonstrated that 60 {\%} of apparent N. brasiliensis associated with pulmonary or disseminated disease, belonged to a new taxonomy named N. pseudobrasiliensis. Because of these associations and a different susceptibility pattern, it is prudent to recommend screening of all N. brasiliensis isolates to rule out possible N. pseudobrasiliensis. Disk-diffusion method for ciprofloxacin susceptibility provides a rapid screening test, as 95 {\%} of N. pseudobrasiliensis strains are susceptible compared with none of N. brasiliensis strains. In a study of 43 cases of N. pseudobrasiliensis, 70 {\%} involved the lung, 23 {\%} involved the CNS, and 37 {\%} had disseminated disease. The majority of patients were receiving corticosteroids (74 {\%}) or had AIDS (14 {\%}). Isolates of N. pseudobrasiliensis, unlike isolates of N. brasiliensis, are strongly associated with invasive disease.",V V Kandasamy and A Kaja and K M Abouelezz and M Tadros,0884-8734,Journal of General Internal Medicine,"Actinomyces,Caucasian,Gram staining,Nocardia,Nocardia brasiliensis,abscess,acid,acquired immune deficiency syndrome,ampicillin,antibiotic agent,antiinfective agent,antimicrobial therapy,biceps brachii muscle,brain,central nervous system,cephalosporin derivative,ciprofloxacin,corticosteroid,disk diffusion,examination,genetic analyzer,hand,human,immunocompromised patient,infection,internal medicine,laboratory,leg,leukocytosis,linezolid,liquid,lung,male,medical history,morphology,moxifloxacin,muscle,myasthenia gravis,nocardiosis,nuclear magnetic resonance imaging,organisms,osteomyelitis,pain,pathogenesis,patient,penicillin derivative,piperacillin plus tazobactam,prednisone,screening,screening test,skin infection,society,species,staining,sulfamethoxazole,swelling,taxonomy,therapy,thorax,trimethoprim,ultrasound,vancomycin,vital sign",s265--s266,{A case of multidrug resistant nocardia pseudobrasiliensis},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l71293217 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=08848734{\&}id=doi:{\&}atitle=a+case+of+multidrug+resistant+nocardia+pseudobrasiliensis{\&}stitle=j.+gen.+intern.+med.{\&},28,2013,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,maybe,brooke,maybe,erica,erica,zach_4,no,zm_4.csv,could not find full-text,NA,NA,no,journal

The index case was detected by chance when a non-prescribed urine culture was taken from an asymptomatic patient with suprapubic urinary catheter in June 2013. Thereafter, all patients on the 38-bed ward were screened until two screening rounds were negative and extensive control measures were performed. Eight additional KPC-KP-carriers were found, and the highest prevalence of carriers on the ward was nine of 38. All other patients hospitalised on the outbreak ward between 1 May and 10 June and 101 former roommates of KPC-KP carriers since January had negative screening results. Two screening rounds on the hospital's other wards were negative. No link to travel abroad was detected. Compared with non-carriers, but without statistical significance, KPC-KP carriers were older (83 vs 76 years) and had more often received antimicrobial treatment within the three months before screening (9/9 vs 90/133).

METHODS: A previously healthy 30-year-old man presented with bilateral decreased vision, redness, and irritation, beginning 1 week earlier. The patient had been treated with moxifloxocin for 1 week before presentation without improvement. Bacterial staining cultures were performed from corneal scrapings, contact lenses, contact lens case, and solution. Preliminary culture results and antibiotic sensitivities were generated using an automated identification system. Positive results from the contact lens, case, and solution were confirmed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: The contact lenses, contact lens case, and solution cultures revealed heavy growth of A. xylosoxidans. These findings were confirmed by PCR. The organism was found to be resistant to aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, and cephalosporins. The patient was started on polymyxin B or trimethoprim. After 21 days of treatment, the infection completely resolved with a final spectacle-corrected visual acuity of 20/25.

10691,yes,kimura2016,article,"Background: Numbers of patients with diabetic gangrene is increasing. Antimicrobial treatment is commonly used, however, limb amputation cannot be avoided in severe cases. For prophylaxis at operation, basic antimicrobial agents such as cefazolin are often administrated, however, severe infection could occur if resistant strains were cultured especially in immunosuppressive patients such as diabetes. The purpose of this study is to clarify bacterial species and their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents for patients of diabetic foot gangrene. Methods{\&}Materials: Twenty-four patients (nine females)who had amputation on their legs for treating diabetic gangrene were enrolled from year 2002 to 2012. Among them, fifteen patients had diabetic history for over ten years, eleven patients were having repetitive hemodialysis. Their ages were 40-81(mean 67), average hospitalization period were 81.6 days. Results: As results, fifty-seven strains were isolated. Among them, 62{\%} strains were Gram-positive cocci, 33{\%} were Gramnegative rods, 5{\%} were Gram-positive rods. Two or more strains were detected in fifteen patients. Indigenous bacteria of skin such as MSSA were most commonly cultured (n = 10). MRSA was found only in one patient. Sixty-seven percent of Peptostreptococci (n = 7), and seventy-five percent of E.coli (n = 4) were resistant to new quinolones. All Enterococci (n = 6) were susceptible to penicillin. Seventy percent of operated patients had no complications and discharged normally. Others had re-operation, including two cases dead due to heart disease. Most commonly used antimicrobial agents for prophylaxis were cefazolin (n = 8). However, sixty percent of all operated cases had resistant bacterial strain against cefazolin. Conclusion: We conclude that in order to avoid inappropriate anti-microbial therapy, it is important to confirm antimicrobial susceptibility with bacterial culture before operation.

We conducted molecular detection and characterization of ESBL-related bla genes, including bla(TEM), bla(SHV), bla(CTX-M), bla(VEB), bla(OXA), bla(PER), and bla(GES), among 362 isolates of ESBL-producing E. coli (n = 235) and ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae (n = 127) collected from patients who met the definition of HA infection at two major university hospitals in Thailand from December 2004 to May 2005. The prevalence of ESBL-producing E. coli and ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae, patient demographics and the susceptibilities of these bacteria to various antimicrobial agents were described. A total of 87.3{\%} of isolates carried several bla genes. The prevalence of bla(CTX-M) was strikingly high: 99.6{\%} for ESBL-producing E. coli (CTX-M-14, -15, -27, -40, and -55) and 99.2{\%} for ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae (CTX-M-3, -14, -15, -27, and -55). ISEcp1 was found in the upstream region of bla(CTX-M) in most isolates. Up to 77.0{\%} and 71.7{\%} of ESBL-producing E. coli and ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae, respectively, carried bla(TEM); all of them encoded TEM-1. ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae carried bla(SHV) at 87.4{\%} (SHV-1, -2a, -11, -12, -27, -71, and -75) but only at 3.8{\%} for ESBL-producing E. coli (SHV-11 and -12). bla genes encoding VEB-1 and OXA-10 were found in both ESBL-producing E. coli (8.5{\%} and 8.1{\%}, respectively) and ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae (10.2{\%} and 11.8{\%}, respectively). None of the isolates were positive for bla(PER) and bla(GES). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis demonstrated that there was no major clonal relationship among these ESBL producers.

A total of 217 MDR P. aeruginosa isolates were obtained from August 2009 to April 2010 from patients at 144 hospitals in Japan, of which 145 (66.8{\%}) were positive for IMP-type MBLs and AAC(6')-Iae when tested with an immunochromatographic assay. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) showed that these isolates were also positive for blaIMP and aac(6')-Iae genes. When these IMP-type MBL- and AAC(6')-Iae-producing isolates were analysed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), two clusters (I and II) were detected. Most of the isolates (88.3{\%}; 128/145) were grouped under cluster I and had multilocus sequence type ST235 and serotype O11, except for one isolate that was ST991 and serotype O3. The isolates were mainly isolated from the urinary tract (82/145; 56.6{\%}) and respiratory tract (58/145; 40.0{\%}). The epidemiological properties of the isolates belonging to cluster I were similar to those of MDR P. aeruginosa isolates that have been previously reported in Japan. The remaining 16 isolates belonged to cluster II, had identical PFGE patterns and were multilocus sequence type ST991 and serotype O18; all of these isolates were isolated from the respiratory tract.

Rifaximin, a nonabsorbable derivative of rifampin effective against E. coli, improves symptoms in mild-to-moderate IBD. However, rifaximin resistance can develop in a single step in vitro. We examined the prevalence and mechanisms of rifaximin resistance in 62 strains of E. coli isolated from the ileal mucosa of 50 patients (19 with ileal Crohn's disease [L1+L3], 6 with colonic Crohn's disease [L2], 13 with ulcerative colitis [UC], 4 with symptomatic non-IBD diagnoses [NI], and 8 healthy [H]). Resistance (MIC {\textgreater} 1,024 mg/liter) was present in 12/48 IBD-associated ileal E. coli strains. Resistance correlated with prior rifaximin treatment (P {\textless} 0.00000001) but not with the presence of ileal inflammation (P = 0.73) or E. coli phylogroup. Mutations in a 1,057-bp region of rpoB, which encodes the bacterial target of rifaximin, were identified in 10/12 resistant strains versus 0/50 sensitive strains (P {\textless} 0.000000001) and consisted of seven amino acid substitutions. The efflux pump inhibitor Phe-Arg-beta-naphthylamide (PAbetaN) lowered the MIC of 9/12 resistant strains 8- to 128-fold. Resistance was stable in the absence of rifaximin in 10/12 resistant strains after 30 passages. We conclude that IBD-associated ileal E. coli frequently manifest resistance to rifaximin that correlates with prior rifaximin use, amino acid substitutions in rpoB, and activity of PAbetaN-inhibitable efflux pumps, but not with the presence of ileal inflammation or E. coli phylogroup.

12055,maybe,li2014i,article,"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has become one of the most significant pathogens affecting global public health and health care systems. In Canada and the United States, the spread of MRSA is primarily attributed to a single dominant epidemic clone: CMRSA10/USA300. Despite this, the CMRSA7/USA400 epidemic clone has been reported to be the predominate epidemic clone in several Canadian provinces and some parts of the United States. This study examined the epidemiology of CMRSA7/USA400 MRSA in Alberta, Canada, from June 2005 to December 2012. Molecular characterization of CMRSA7/USA400 isolates was done using spa, SCCmec, PVL, and PFGE typing and identified two predominant spa types in Alberta: t128 and t1787. Although closely related, these spa types have distinct geographic distributions. From 2010 to 2012, the number of t128 infections has remained stable while there has been a nearly 3-fold increase in the number of provincial t1787 infections, accompanied by 10-fold increases in t1787 infection rates in some communities. Most t128 and t1787 patients were First Nations or Inuit people, and isolates were usually from skin and soft tissue infections in outpatients. t128 patients were significantly older than t1787 patients.

12279,maybe,liu2011a,article,"Purpose: Although E. coli is not the usual pathogen for respiratory disease, we investigated the association of qnr genes for quinolone resistance with bla genes on conjugation plasmid. Materials and Methods: Forty E. coli were collected from Tainan Hospital in 2007 - 2008 and identified in our laboratory. Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by disc diffusion method. Five bla genes and 12 virulence factors were examined by multiplex PCR. The plasmid number and size were analyzed. Plasmid mediated resistance genes were investigated. Results: Although 5 bla genes were examined, 6 isolates lacked any bla. Over 60{\%} of E. coli isolates produced ESBL and contained more than one bla. The predominant bla genes were blaCMY (70{\%}), blaTEM (57.5{\%}), blaSHV (20{\%}), blaCTX-M3 (15{\%}), blaCTX-M14 (12.5{\%}), and blaDHA (5{\%}). Examination of ciprofloxacin resistance isolates found mutations in the gyrA and parC and three plasmid mediated qnr genes qnrA, qnrB, and qnrS. The associated of bla and qnr were determined for qnrA with blaCMY, qnrB with blaDHA, and qnrS with bla CMY and blaSHV.

Aim To investigate the prevalence of mutations in genes associated with drug resistance in M. leprae isolates from patients with leprosy in Shandong Province. Methods The DRDR in the FolP1, RpoB and GyrA genes was analysed by direct sequencing of the PCR product from 85 isolates of M. leprae sampled from patients with leprosy in Shandong, China. Results Sequencing results were obtained for FolP1, RpoB and GyrA in 67, 57 and 81 of the 85 samples, with mutation rates of 1.5{\%} (1/67), 8.8{\%} 5/57 and 25.9{\%} (21/81). Three multidrug-resistant samples were found among the new cases: one had a mutation in both Folp1 and RpoB, while the other two had a mutation in both RpoB and GyrA.

12406,yes,lobel2008,article,"INTRODUCTION: The treatment of urinary tract infection (UTI) in women is based mainly on empirical antibiotic therapy. It requires up-to-date knowledge of the susceptibility patterns of the bacteria most commonly identified in that setting. The aim of this prospective study was to measure the antibiotic susceptibility of Escherichia coli isolates responsible for UTIs in women from a single area and to compare it in hospital and community settings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From May 2003 through April 2004, UTI was diagnosed in 1838 women around Rennes (France), 893 of them inpatients admitted to the teaching hospital and 945 outpatients in the community. We determined the susceptibility to 7 antibiotics of the resulting 1217 E. coli isolates. RESULTS: E. coli resistance rates in hospitalized and community patients were respectively 47.9{\%} and 39.2{\%} for aminopenicillins, 47.3{\%} and 25.4{\%} for coamoxiclav, 19.2{\%} and 14.1{\%} for cotrimoxazole, 14.3{\%} and 5.7{\%} for first-generation quinolones, and 8.9{\%} and 3.7{\%} for fluoroquinolones. All these rates were significantly higher among hospitalized patients (p{\textless}0.05). Conversely, resistance to injectable third-generation cephalosporins and fosfomycin was similar and infrequent in both groups.

Methods: From May 2005 to June 2009, 200 clinical isolates of Proteus mirabilis and Morganella morganii were isolated from patients with respiratory or urinary tract infections hospitalized at Military hospital in Tunis (Tunisia). Antibiotic susceptibility was tested with the agar disk diffusion method according to CASFM guidelines. ESBLs were detected using a standard double-disk synergy test. Characterisation of ESBLs and their genetic environments as well as integrons and their gene cassette composition were performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and nucleotide sequencing. For the genotyping method, we used pulsed-field gel electrophoresis using SfiI and SpeI restriction endonuclease. Results: 21 of 200 (7{\%}) strains exhibited non susceptibility to third generation cephalosporins and among these strains the double-disk synergy test confirmed the phenotype of ESBLs in 13 isolates (62{\%}). These ESBLs producers were coresistant to chloramphenicol, tetracyclin and ofloxacin, but remained susceptible to Ertapenem (MIC {\textless}0.25). By PCR and nucleotide sequencing, we detected the presence of bla genes as follows (number of isolates): blaCTX-M-15 (7), blaCTX-M-8 (1), blaTEM-24 (10), blaTEM-1(4) and blaTEM-2 (4). ISEcp1, IS26 and IS903, 0RF477 were located upstream and downstream, respectively, of the blaCTX-M-15 gene in 7 strains. The intI1 gene was detected respectively in four and one strains of M. morganii and P. mirabilis including different gene cassettes: the combination dfrA1, orfC and aadB were found, respectively, in 2 and 3 isolates. All CTX-M-15 producing isolates showed unrelated PFGE patterns. Conclusion: The emergence of mobile genetic elements like ISEcp1 carried blaCTX-M-15 gene in P. mirabilis and M. morganii was first discovered at the Military hospital in Tunisia.

This isolate was resistant to penicillins, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones. A marked in vitro synergy between ceftazidime or cefotaxime and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid on Mueller-Hinton agar plates suggested the presence of an extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase. In addition, an unusual synergy was found between cefepime or aztreonam, and cefoxitin or imipenem on a double disk synergy test suggesting a VEB-type extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase. The characterization of beta-lactamases and associated resistance genes was performed by isoelectric focusing, polymerase chain reaction and nucleotide sequencing. Two beta-lactamases bands with pI values of 5.4 and 7.7, which were matched to TEM-1, VEB-1-a and OXA-2-like beta-lactamases were detected. The blaVEB-1-a gene was found to be associated with complex genetic structures, including Re elements. These beta-lactamases were not transferred by electroporation or conjugation experiments to the transconjugants and electroporants. Hybridization methods showed that the extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase encoding gene may have a chromosomal localization. The isolate SM662 produced the quinolone resistance determinants qnrA6 and aac(6')-Ib-cr which were successfully transferred. The detection of an associated chromosomal quinolone resistance revealed the presence of a gyrA mutation at codon 83 (Ser83Ile).

13002,maybe,manageiro2012a,article,"Objectives: The identification of isolates containing AmpC blactamases is epidemiologically and clinically relevant. With this study we performed the phenotypic and molecular characterization of two new CMY-2-types, designated CMY-46 and CMY-50, encountered among a total of 1664 clinical non-duplicate isolates of various Enterobacteriaceae species. Methods: E. coli INSRA1169 and INSRA3413 were isolated from the urine of patients with 77 years and 7 months old, hospitalized in the ward and in pediatrics, respectively. The blaCMY genes were cloned in the plasmid pBK-CMV and transformed into electrocompetent E. coli DH5 alpha delta ampC by electroporation. Antimicrobial susceptibility (MIC) was determined by a microdilution method. E. coli INSRA6015, a CMY-2-producer, was used for phenotype comparison. PCR-mapping of the genetic environment of new blaCMY genes was performed using primers for known antibiotic and mercury resistance genes. Results: Antimicrobial susceptibly tests showed that all isolates and respective transformants were nonsusceptible to amoxicillin, amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, cephalothin, cefoxitin, ceftazidime and cefotaxime. INSRA1169 and INSRA6015 were also nonsusceptible to ciprofloxacin and to trimethoprim. Regarding gentamycin, only INSRA1169 was resistant. Its noteworthy that the transformants EcDH5a(pBK-CMY-2) and EcDH5a(pBK-CMY-46) exhibited higher values for extended-spectrum cephalosporins than the respective isolates. All strains were susceptible to cefepime and imipenem, showing synergy between cloxacilin and cefoxitin and/or ceftazidime. No phenotypic alterations were found comparing the new CMY-type with the parental CMY-2. The genetic characterization of CMY-46 and CMY-50-encoding genes revealed a Citrobacter freundii chromosometype structure, encompassing a blc-sugE-blaCMY-2-type-ampR platform in both isolates. In addition, a sul1-type class 1 integron and a truncated mercury resistance operon were encountered. Conclusion: Although the CMY-type enzymes studied conferred resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins, the susceptibility to cefepime lead us to assume that those enzymes are not extendedspectrum cephalosporinases. Otherwise, the presence of three genetic resistance-encoding regions is of great concern, namely the truncated mercury resistance operon, which may help to promote antibiotic resistance through indirect selection.",V Manageiro and D Louro and E Ferreira and M Canicåüa,1198-743x,Clinical Microbiology and Infection,"Citrobacter freundii,Enterobacteriaceae,Escherichia coli,amoxicillin,amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid,antibiotic agent,antibiotic resistance,antibiotic sensitivity,antiinfective agent,cefalotin,cefepime,cefotaxime,cefoxitin,ceftazidime,cephalosporin derivative,ciprofloxacin,electroporation,environment,enzyme,gene,genetic resistance,gentamicin,human,imipenem,infection,integron,mercury,microbiology,operon,patient,pediatrics,phenotype,plasmid,species,trimethoprim,urine,ward",738--739,"{Phenotypic and molecular characterisation of CMY-46 and CMY-50, two novel plasmid-mediated AmpC betalactamase carried by Escherichia coli}",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l70824204 http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-0691.2012.03803.x http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=1198743x{\&}id=doi:10.1111{\%}2fj.1469-0691.2012.03803.x{\&}atitle=p,18,2012,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,no,cale,maybe,zach,brooke,zach_4,no,zm_4.csv,could not find full-text,NA,NA,no,journal

As only a few studies with a small number of samples were done in this regard in India, the present study was undertaken to report the prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility pattern of MRSA screened from diabetes patients with foot ulcers, attending tertiary care hospitals. Settings and Design: It was a retrospective study carried out at Department of Microbiology, Dr.N.G.P Arts and Science College, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India during the period from November 2002 to October 2006. Methods: The present study comprised of 7354 pus specimens of diabetic foot ulcer patients collected from various tertiary care hospitals in and around Coimbatore. All the samples were subjected to gram staining and bacterial culture, and the S. aureus isolates were screened for MRSA prevalence using conventional microbiological methods. Subsequently, the antibiotic sensitivity test was performed for the confirmed MRSA isolates. Results: Out of 2314 (37.82{\%}) strains of S. aureus isolated form diabetic foot ulcers, 992 (42.86{\%}) were found to be methicillin resistant. More precisely, all MRSA strains (100{\%}) were resistant to penicillin, 90.92{\%} to ampicillin, 82.76{\%} to clotrimoxazole, 64.11{\%} to gentamicin, 60.08{\%} to erythromycin, 51.91{\%} to omnatax and 50.10{\%} to cephalexin. Multi drug resistance for about 7 to 10 antibiotics was observed among 55.0{\%} of the isolates. However, all the strains were sensitive to vancomycin (100{\%}).

The majority of patients had received a course of first-line antibiotics such as chloramphenicol, ampicillin or co-trimoxazole before admission. On bacteriological investigation, Salmonella Typhi was isolated from the blood of 11 patients with peritonitis. The isolates were all resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline and co-trimoxazole, but sensitive to third-generation cephalosporins, quinolone (nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacine) and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid.

14680,maybe,muzevich2013,article,"OBJECTIVE: To report a case of subtherapeutic linezolid concentrations in a patient with morbid obesity. CASE SUMMARY: A 34-year-old male with morbid obesity (265 kg, body mass index 82 kg/m2) was admitted for severe sepsis due to respiratory failure requiring emergent intubation and treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. Admission tracheal aspirate culture revealed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) for which vancomycin was prescribed. Therapy subsequently was changed to linezolid, because the patient's clinical status worsened, with significant hypoxia (partial pressure of arterial oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen [PaO2/FiO2] ratio 145), increasing leukocytosis (white blood cell count from 10,800/$\mu$L on admission to 15,400/$\mu$L on hospital day 6), and persistent fever (38.3 å¡C). After 48 hours of linezolid monotherapy, the patient remained febrile with continued leukocytosis, worsening hypoxemia, and a persistently positive MRSA culture from a repeat endotracheal aspirate. Linezolid serum concentrations were obtained and vancomycin was reinstituted, after which the patient began to improve (afebrile, improving PaO2/FiO2 ratio, decreasing leukocytosis). On hospital day 12, the patient removed his endotracheal tube, and a sputum sample was obtained for culture. The patient's clinical status subsequently declined, prompting addition of cefepime to his antibiotic regimen. This sputum culture revealed not only MRSA, but also quinolone-resistant Escherichia coli. After completing treatment for both organisms the patient was discharged home. DISCUSSION: Limited data on linezolid dosing in the morbidly obese population show lower serum drug concentrations than those in nonobese patients, but no clinical failure has been reported when treating MRSA skin and soft tissue infections or MRSA tracheitis. In our patient, low steady-state linezolid serum concentrations (peak 4.13 $\mu$g/mL [reference 15-27] and trough 1.27 $\mu$g/mL [reference 2-9]) were thought to contribute to his poor clinical response. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first report of subtherapeutic linezolid concentrations correlated with decreased clinical effectiveness when during treatment of MRSA pneumonia in a patient with morbid obesity. {\textcopyright} 1967-2013 Harvey Whitney Books Co.

This study investigated the molecular mechanism of beta-lactam and aminoglycoside resistance in extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Salmonella enterica serotype Infantis isolated at the 53-bed neonatology ward of University Hospital Benabib in Constantine, Algeria. From September 2008 to January 2009, 200 S. enterica isolates were obtained from 138 patients (age range 8-80 months) hospitalised in the neonatology ward. Most isolates were from stool cultures, but also from two blood cultures and one gastric fluid. The isolates were multidrug-resistant and produced TEM-1 and CTX-M-15 enzymes as well as the 16S RNA methylase ArmA. The armA, bla(CTX-M-15) and bla(TEM-1) genes were located on the same 140-kb self-transferable plasmid belonging to the IncL/M incompatibility group. All of the S. Infantis isolates belonged to a single clone. Increased infection control measures and thorough biodecontamination of the rooms led to control of the outbreak but did not eradicate the epidemic strain. This study further illustrates the global emergence of ArmA methylase and its frequent association with bla(CTX-M) genes.

This case was remarkable in two aspects: first, it illustrated the reemergence of S. paratyphiåÊA infections in people having traveled to India, with increasing fluoroquinolone resistance, and second the difficulty of diagnosing this disease, since the patient was initially treated for pneumonia and flu-like syndrome. Salmonella typhi or paratyphi infections should be evoked in case of persistent fever in patients having traveled to endemic areas, even if digestive signs are absent. Furthermore, choosing an empiric antibiotic treatment with fluoroquinolones could lead to treatment failure if the patient traveled in a country where fluoroquinolone resistance is high, as in Asia and especially in India. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Clinical data and blood for culturing and susceptibility testing were obtained from 469 consecutively enrolled neonates, children and adults presenting with signs of systemic infections at Mnazi Mmoja Hospital, Zanzibar. RESULTS Pathogenic bacteria were recovered from the blood of 14{\%} of the patients (66/469). The most frequently isolated microbes were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter spp. and Staphylococcus aureus.

16683,maybe,pletz2006a,article,"Fluoroquinolone resistance in Streptococcus pyogenes has been described only anecdotally. In this study we describe two invasive ciprofloxacin-resistant S. pyogenes isolates (ciprofloxacin MICs, 8 mg/liter), one of which shows evidence of interspecies recombination. The quinolone resistance-determining regions of gyrA and parC were sequenced. In both isolates, there was no evidence for an efflux pump and no mutation in gyrA. Both isolates had an S79F mutation inparC that is known to confer fluoroquinolone resistance. In addition, a D91N mutation in parC, which is not related to fluoroquinolone resistance but is a feature of the parC sequence of Streptococcus dysgalactiae, was found in one isolate. The parC nucleotide sequence of that isolate showed greater diversity than that of S. pyogenes. A GenBank search and phylogenetic analysis suggest that this isolate acquired resistance by horizontal gene transfer from S. dysgalactiae. Statistical testing for recombination confirmed interspecies recombination of a 90-bp sequence containing the S79F mutation from S. dysgalactiae. For the other isolate, we could confirm that it acquired resistance by spontaneous mutation by identifying the susceptible ancestor in an outbreak setting.

16801,maybe,porres-osante2014,article,"OBJECTIVES: To characterize the mechanisms involved in carbapenem resistance, as well as the genetic elements supporting their mobilization, in a multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli isolate. METHODS: The E. coli isolate was obtained from a patient with fatal urinary sepsis. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by the disc diffusion and agar dilution methods. The E. coli molecular type and phylogroup were determined using multilocus sequence typing and the triple PCR technique, respectively. PCR and sequencing were used for virulence and resistance genotype characterization. Plasmid content and gene location were analysed by S1-PFGE, I-Ceu1-PFGE and hybridization experiments. Transformation assays were performed. RESULTS: The E. coli strain, typed as ST448 and phylogroup B1, was resistant to all tested antibiotics except fosfomycin, tigecycline and tetracycline. The following resistance and virulence genetic structures were obtained: ISKpn7 + bla(KPC-3) + ISKpn6 linked to Tn4401; tnpR + aac(6')-Ib'-9 + aadA1 + bla(OXA-9) + tnpR + bla(TEM-1a) + tnpB + strB + strA + sul2; intI1 + bla(VIM-1) + aac(6')-Ib' + aphA15 + aadA1 + catB2 + qacEDelta1-sul1 + orf5; ISEcp1 + bla(CMY-2); IS26 + bla(SHV-12); aph(3')-I; aac(3)-IV; floR; catA; and fimA. Mutations in the ampC promoter (-18, -1 and +58) and substitutions in the GyrA (Ser-83--{\textgreater}Leu and Asp-87--{\textgreater}Asn) and ParC (Ser-80--{\textgreater}Ile) proteins were observed. IncFII (ST2), IncA/C and ColE(TP) plasmids of 145.5, 87 and {\textless}2 kb, respectively, were found. The bla(VIM-1) gene was located in a non-typeable plasmid of {\textgreater}300 kb, and the bla(KPC-3) gene in the 145.5 kb IncFII plasmid.

17441,maybe,reich2016a,article,"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections cause significant morbidity and mortality in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). We characterized the clinical and molecular epidemiology of MRSA strains colonizing NICU patients. Nasal MRSA isolates (n = 250, from 96 NICU patients) recovered through active surveillance from 2009 to 2014 were characterized with staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing and detection of mupA (marker of high-level mupirocin resistance) and qacA/B (marker associated with chlorhexidine resistance). Factors associated with community-associated (CA-) or healthcare-associated (HA-) MRSA were evaluated. The overall prevalence of MRSA nasal colonization was 3.9{\%}. Of 96 neonates in our retrospective cohort, 60 (63{\%}) were colonized with CA-MRSA strains and 35 (36{\%}) were colonized with HA-MRSA strains. Patients colonized with HA-MRSA were more likely to develop MRSA infections than patients colonized with CA-MRSA (13/35, 37{\%} versus 8/60, 13{\%}; p 0.007), although the interval from colonization to infection was shorter in CA-MRSA-colonized infants (median 0 days, range -1 to 4 versus HA-MRSA-colonized infants, 7 days, -1 to 43; p 0.005). Maternal peripartum antibiotics were associated with CA-MRSA colonization (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 8.7; 95{\%} CI 1.7-45.0); intubation and surgical procedures were associated with HA-MRSA colonization (aOR 7.8; 95{\%} CI 1.3-47.6 and aOR 6.0; 95{\%} CI 1.4-24.4, respectively). Mupirocin- and chlorhexidine-resistant MRSA was isolated from four and eight patients, respectively; carriage of a mupirocin-resistant strain precluded decolonization.

18398,maybe,sarma2011,article,"PURPOSE: A study was carried out in an Indian teaching hospital in 2009 to detect the rate of surgical site infections (SSI) and peripheral vascular access site infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was a point-prevalence study involving over 300 patients. The presence of infection was determined according to the CDC criteria. Swabs were taken from the infected sites and identification and sensitivity were carried out using VITEK(R) 2 automated system. Characterisation of beta-lactamase was carried out at ARRML, Colindale, London. RESULTS: The rate of SSI was 15{\%} for the clean and clean-contaminated categories while that for the dirty contaminated category was 85{\%} (NNIS risk index 0). Cultures yielded definite or probable pathogens from 64{\%} (9/14) of the patients with SSI. In 1/3 rd of the cultures, Staphylococcus aureus was grown and the rest had Enterobacteriaceae, either extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers or Amp-C hyperproducers and, alarmingly, three isolates were positive for newly recognised New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1). In medicine, 87{\%} (n = 99) of the patients had a peripheral IV access device, 55{\%} developed associated phlebitis/infection and, in seven, probable pathogens were isolated (Candida species and Escherichia coli producing ESBL and NDM-1, respectively, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium). All ESBL and metallo-beta-lactamase producers were resistant to multiple classes of antimicrobials, the latter being sensitive only to colistin and tigecycline. The study also found that all post-operative patients were on antibiotics, 92{\%} on IV [213 defined daily doses (DDD)/100 post-op patients] limited mainly to the third-generation cephalosporins (26{\%}) and aminoglycosides (24{\%}) and imidazole derivatives (30{\%}). In medicine, 83{\%} (n = 82) were on IV antibiotics (123 DDD/100 bed-days), limited mainly to the third-generation cephalosporins (74{\%}). CONCLUSION: Indiscriminate use of antibiotics is a major problem predisposing patients to harm by multi-resistant pathogens. Carbapenems were in little use in this hospital, but the selection pressure exerted by cephalosporins and other unrelated classes was sufficient to select NDM-1-producing strains due to co-selection, suggesting a role of single plasmid carrying resistance genes to multiple classes.",J B Sarma and P K Bhattacharya and D Kalita and M Rajbangshi,0255-0857,Indian J Med Microbiol,"Adult,Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology,Catheter-Related Infections/microbiology,Cross Infection/*microbiology,Enterobacteriaceae Infections/*microbiology,Enterobacteriaceae/*drug effects/*enzymology/isola,Female,Hospitals, Teaching,Humans,India,Male,Surgical Wound Infection/microbiology,beta-Lactamases/*biosynthesis,beta-Lactams/pharmacology",22--27,{Multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae including metallo-beta-lactamase producers are predominant pathogens of healthcare-associated infections in an Indian teaching hospital},NA,29,2011,1,"1998-3646sarma, j bbhattacharya, p kkalita, drajbangshi, mjournal articleindiaindian j med microbiol. 2011 jan-mar;29(1):22-7. doi: 10.4103/0255-0857.76519.",10.4103/0255-0857.76519,2/10/11,eng,21304190,maybe,erica,no,mushtaq,zach,zach_4,yes,zm_4.csv,NA,NA,zm_4_4.mex,yes,journal
18449,yes,saunders2007,article,"BACKGROUND: Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) has increasingly been isolated from individuals with no predisposing risk factors; however, such strains have rarely been linked to outbreaks in the hospital setting. The present study describes the investigation of an outbreak of CA-MRSA that occurred in the maternal-newborn unit of a large community teaching hospital in Toronto, Ontario. METHODS: Screening and clinical specimens collected from mothers and newborns delivered during the outbreak period, as well as from staff on the affected unit, were submitted for microbiological testing. Computerized delivery logs and nursing notes were reviewed, and a case control study was conducted. RESULTS: Analysis by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed 38 babies and seven mothers with MRSA colonization and/or infection by the same unique strain (Canadian MRSA-10-related) from September to December 2004. Isolates were characterized as having the staphylococcal chromosome cassette mec type IVa and were positive for the Panton-Valentine leukocidin gene. No one health care worker was associated with all cases; however, mothers and newborns exposed to one particular nurse (Nurse A) were almost 23 times (odds ratio 22.7, 95{\%} CI 3.3 to 195.9) more likely to acquire MRSA than those with no such contact. MRSA was successfully isolated from Nurse A and from an environmental swab of a telephone recently used by Nurse A; both isolates matched the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pattern of the outbreak strain. CONCLUSION: The first nosocomial outbreak of CA-MRSA among healthy newborns and postpartum mothers in Canada is described. Effective control of sustained MRSA transmission within an institution may require prompt identification, treatment and monitoring of colonized and/or infected staff. {\textcopyright}2007 Pulsus Group Inc.

Sporadic cases of NDM-1 positive strains have been reported from different countries, suggesting a widespread dissemination. The aim of this study was the detection of MBLs in Enterobacteriaceae isolated from patients in Tehran hospitals. After identification tests, the susceptibility to the antibiotics was done by Kirby-Bauer method and broth microdilution. Carbapenem-resistant isolates were tested for carbapenemase production using the modified Hodge test (MHT). Carbapenem-resistant strains screened for bla(KPC) gene and genes encoding MBLs. Twenty-three isolates (6.3{\%}) were resistant to meropenem, eleven isolates (3{\%}) were resistant to ertapenem, and four isolates (1.1{\%}) were resistant to imipenem. MHT was positive in 11 (47.8{\%}) of the carbapenem-resistant isolates. In March 2011, we detected a multiple drug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate that was resistant to all tested antibiotics except colistin. PCR confirmed that this isolate contained bla(NDM-1), bla(TEM), bla(SHV), and bla(CTX-M). This is the first report on the detection of MBL NDM-1 in Iran.

The objective of this study was to detect the rpoB gene mutations in rifampin-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates circulated in Sichuan, as well as the possible correlation between molecular typing of TB population and rpoB mutation patterns that confer rifampin resistance in M. tuberculosis. Methods: Antimicrobial drug susceptibility test of M. tuberculosisisolates from 3645 pulmonary tuberculosis patients from different regions of Sichuan province from January 2008 to May 2010 was carried out by standard conventional proportion method. Spoligotying and sequencing of the rpoB gene were performed for 268 randomly selected isolates, including 213 rifampin-resistant and 55 rifampin-susceptible isolates. Results: Mutations in the rpoB gene were detected in 207 (97.2{\%}) of 213 rifampin-resistant isolates and one (1.8{\%}) of 55 rifampinsusceptible isolates, respectively. The most common mutations were in codon 531 (55.9{\%}), 526 (16.4{\%}), 516 (10.3{\%}), together accounting for 82.6{\%} of rifampin-resistant isolates. New mutations were also identified in codon 144 (Val-{\textgreater}Gly), 149 (Leu-{\textgreater}Pro), 401 (Val-{\textgreater}Phe) and 616 (Ser-{\textgreater}Leu) of rpoB gene in rifampin-resistant isolates.

Conclusion: The new mutations identified in this study illustrate the need to disclose the unknown rifampin-resistance-associated mutations in M. tuberculosis isolates for an improved identification of rifampinresistant isolates.

20957,yes,toprakulger2013,article,"Bacteroides species, the predominant constituents of the human intestinal microbiota can cause serious intraabdominal and postoperative wound infections and bacteremia. Moreover, these bacteria are more resistant to antimicrobial agents than the other anaerobes. The limited number of the antimicrobials, such as carbapenems, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors and nitroimidazoles are highly effective in eliminating Bacteroides. However, a few metronidazole- resistant isolates have been reported from several countries recently. The nim genes (nim A-G) are suggested to be responsible for the majority of the metronidazole resistance. Here, we describe a metronidazole-resistant Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron isolated from a blood culture. A gram-negative obligate anaerobic rod was isolated from the postoperative 5th day blood culture of a 62-year-old male patient with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas head. The strain was identified as B.thetaiotaomicron by using a combination of conventional tests and commercially available biochemical kits. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by agar dilution method. The resistance genes were investigated by means of PCR using specific primer pairs for nim gene. The purified PCR product was sequenced and analyzed by comparison of the consensus sequences with CenBank sequences. The MIC for metronidazole was 16 mg/L. Although the strain was intermediate according the CLSI criteria, it was resistant ({\textgreater} 4 mg/L) according to EUCAST criteria. The isolate was nim gene positive, and nucleotide sequencing of the PCR product shared 100{\%} similarity with nimE gene (embJAM042593.1J). On the other hand the isolate was susceptible to carbapenems and sulbactam-am-picillin. Following administration of ampicillin-sulbactam, the patient's fever disappeared after 24 hours. The clinical condition improved considerably and he was discharged at day 8. The patient was followed up at the medical oncology clinic; however he died due to disease progression six months after surgery. Since anaerobic bacteremia is associated with high mortality rate, prompt diagnosis and proper management are critical.

21149,maybe,tsakris2008a,article,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the first KPC carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate from a Greek hospital, including phenotypic methods to aid recognition of this resistance type. METHODS: A carbapenem-resistant clinical isolate of K. pneumoniae was recovered from a hospitalized Greek patient. Detailed susceptibility testing was carried out by the agar dilution method. The isolate was screened by phenotypic and genotypic assays for the presence of various beta-lactamases. Boronic acid disc tests were performed to show the ability of these tests to detect production of the KPC enzymes. The potential for conjugal transfer of carbapenem resistance was examined by biparental matings, plasmid analysis and PCR studies. RESULTS: The isolate possessed on the same self-transferable plasmid the KPC-2 carbapenemase and the SHV-12 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. Although the isolate did not produce an AmpC-type enzyme, the production of KPC-2 was associated with positive boronic acid disc tests using cephamycins and cefotaxime as well as cefepime and carbapenems as substrates. DISCUSSION: KPC-2-possessing K. pneumoniae clinical isolates seem to have been introduced in our region.

OBJECTIVE: To determine U.S. trends in the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance of N. gonorrhoeae from 1988 to 2003. DESIGN: 16-year, multisite, sentinel surveillance for gonococcal isolate susceptibility through the Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project (GISP). SETTING: Sexually transmitted disease clinics in 37 cities. PATIENTS: Male patients with a total of 82,064 episodes of urethral gonorrhea. MEASUREMENTS: Primary outcome measures included percentage of gonococcal isolates resistant to antimicrobials used to treat gonorrhea, percentage of patients treated with specific antimicrobials for gonorrhea, and trends of these measures over time. RESULTS: The median age of patients was 26 years, and 74.1{\%} of patients were African American. The proportion of men treated with penicillins for gonorrhea declined from 39.5{\%} in 1988 to 0{\%} in 1994, while the proportion of those receiving fluoroquinolone treatment increased from 0{\%} in 1988 to 42.0{\%} in 2003. Penicillin resistance peaked at 19.6{\%} in 1991, then declined to 6.5{\%} in 2003. Tetracycline resistance peaked at 25.8{\%} in 1997 and declined to 14.4{\%} in 2003. The first fluoroquinolone-resistant isolate was found in 1991. Nationally, 0.4{\%} of isolates were fluoroquinolone-resistant in 1999 and were identified in 39{\%} of GISP cities. By 2003, 4.1{\%} of isolates were fluoroquinolone-resistant and were identified in 70{\%} of GISP cities. Isolates with decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone, cefixime, azithromycin, and spectinomycin remained rare. In 2001, 3 multidrug-resistant isolates with decreased susceptibility to cefixime were identified. LIMITATION: Sentinel surveillance may not fully reflect trends for all patients with gonorrhea in the United States. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of penicillin resistance has declined in the years since gonorrhea treatment with penicillin was discontinued.

Death from shigellosis is rare in Fiji. However, the global problem of emerging multi-drug resistance raises some issues about the management of Shigellosis in this country. Within Fiji, Shigella is a notifiable disease. The Fiji Ministry of Health recorded 68 cases of Shigella in 1996, 173 cases in 1997 and 334 cases in 1998 (no data available for 1999). There was only one recorded death during this time--in 1998. Resistance to chloramphenicol occurred in 82{\%} of cases. Shigella flexneri in Fiji remains sensitive to cephalothin and cefaclor. The current antibiotic guidelines in Fiji, recommend that antibiotics be used only for cases of moderate and severe dysentery. Shigellosis was suspected soon after presentation however the patient was unable to take oral antibiotics and was treated with intravenous antibiotics (chloramphenicol and ampicillin), which were ineffective due to resistance of the organism. The current antibiotic guidelines for severe dysentry recommend chloramphenicol or nalidixic acid--the later not available in Fiji.

22366,yes,weissman2013,article,"Resistance to extended-spectrum beta-lactams is increasing worldwide among Escherichia coli and has been linked to a small number of emergent clones (e.g. ST38, ST131 and ST405) recovered from extraintestinal infections in community and hospital settings. There are, however, limited data about the relative contributions of bacterial strains, plasmids and beta-lactamase genes to extended-spectrum beta-lactam resistance in paediatric infections. We performed an extensive molecular analysis of phylogenetic, virulence and antibiotic resistance-related properties of 49 previously reported serial E. coli isolates recovered during 1999-2007 at Seattle Children's Hospital (Seattle, WA). Class C enzyme CMY-2 and class A enzyme CTX-M-15 were the most prominent extended-spectrum beta-lactam resistance enzymes in the collection, first appearing in this patient population in 2001 and 2003, respectively, and then steadily increasing in frequency over the remainder of the study period. Among 19 CMY-2-positive isolates, 16 distinct STs were detected (D = 98.25{\%}, 95{\%} CI 96-100.25{\%}), indicating that CMY spread is non-clonal at the host strain level. In contrast, among ten CTX-M-15-positive isolates, three STs were detected (D = 37.78{\%}, 95{\%} CI 2.36-73.20{\%}), of which eight represented the worldwide-disseminated ST131 lineage, consistent with clonal spread of CTX-M-15-associated resistance. fimHTR subtyping of ten ST131 isolates (including two CTX-M-negative isolates) revealed that, within ST131, carriage of allele fimHTR30 correlated with CTX-M-15 positivity, whilst carriage of non-fimHTR30 alleles correlated with carriage of non-CTX-M enzymes.

Because the patient had received rifampin monotherapy during the course of treatment for presumed BCG disease, the clinical picture favoured acquired rifampin resistance.

22903,yes,yamamoto2013,article,"Introduction: Pseudomonas fulva is Gram-negative bacilli producing yellow-orange pigments and has been first reported as an environmental bacterium from Japan. P. fulva is a very rare cause of infection and only two cases due to this pathogen (meningitis and bloodstream infection) were reported. Furthermore, class 1 integron containing bla VIM-2 metallo-b-lactamase (MBL) gene has been found in this species. Methods: Pseudomonas spp. isolate screening positive for MBL production was found from urine of a 70 years old male patient with lung cancer and analyzed in Kyoto University Hospital, Japan. Specieslevel identification was carried out by sequencing gyrB gene, rpoB gene, and rpoD gene. The MBL genes (IMP, VIM, SPM, GIM and SIM) were detected by multiplex PCR. Integrase genes (intI1 , intI2, and intI3 ) were detected by PCR. To identify the genetic environment of MBL gene, the total of extracted genome was digested with restriction enzyme EcoRI, and obtained fragments were ligated into pUC19 vector digestedwith EcoRI. All of recombination plasmidswere electroporated into Escherichia coli , and cultured on LB agar with ceftazidime (4 mg/ml). Then recombination plasmid containing MBL gene was selected. Selected plasmid was extracted and sequenced. Results: P. fulva was confirmed by species-level identification. IMPtype MBL gene and intI3 gene were detected from this isolate. As the result of analyzing the genetic environment of MBL gene, class 3 integron containing bla IMP-1 was found and this integron included two other resistance gene cassettes. The order of these resistance gene cassettes was as follows: intI3 -aac( 6')-31-fosE -bla IMP-1.

22980,yes,yang2016f,article,"Background: The majority of nontyphoid Salmonella infection is identified in children. When an invasive or severe Salmonella infection is encountered, ceftriaxone is recommended for such patients. A 2-year-old girl was hospitalized for the treatment of Salmonella bacteremia and discharged with standard ceftriaxone treatment. She was readmitted to the hospital after 2 days due to the recurrence of the Salmonella bacteremia. The study aimed to unveil the mechanism for the relapse. Methods: Six isolates (blood and 2 stool) were recovered from the patient, with the last two blood isolates being ceftriaxone-resistant. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was used for genotyping. Ceftriaxone resistance genes and transferability of the resistance plasmid were examined by molecular methods. Results: All isolates were identified as Salmonella enterica serotype Oranienburg. Five isolates demonstrated almost identical electrophoresis patterns, except that in the two ceftriaxone-resistant isolates an extra band ({\textgreater}100 kb) was noted. A blaCMY-2 gene, carried by a 120-kb conjugative IncI1 plasmid of the sequence type 53, was identified in the two ceftriaxone-resistant isolates. Transfer of the resistance plasmid from one blood isolate to Escherichia coli J53 resulted in the increase of ceftriaxone minimum inhibitory concentration from 0.125 $\mu$g/mL to 32 $\mu$g/mL in the recipient. Conclusion: Ceftriaxone is the standard therapeutic choice for invasive or serious Salmonella infections in children.

23107,yes,yong2009,article,"A Swedish patient of Indian origin traveled to New Delhi, India, and acquired a urinary tract infection caused by a carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae strain that typed to the sequence type 14 complex. The isolate, Klebsiella pneumoniae 05-506, was shown to possess a metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) but was negative for previously known MBL genes. Gene libraries and amplification of class 1 integrons revealed three resistance-conferring regions; the first contained bla(CMY-4) flanked by ISEcP1 and blc. The second region of 4.8 kb contained a complex class 1 integron with the gene cassettes arr-2, a new erythromycin esterase gene; ereC; aadA1; and cmlA7. An intact ISCR1 element was shown to be downstream from the qac/sul genes. The third region consisted of a new MBL gene, designated bla(NDM-1), flanked on one side by K. pneumoniae DNA and a truncated IS26 element on its other side. The last two regions lie adjacent to one another, and all three regions are found on a 180-kb region that is easily transferable to recipient strains and that confers resistance to all antibiotics except fluoroquinolones and colistin. NDM-1 shares very little identity with other MBLs, with the most similar MBLs being VIM-1/VIM-2, with which it has only 32.4{\%} identity. As well as possessing unique residues near the active site, NDM-1 also has an additional insert between positions 162 and 166 not present in other MBLs. NDM-1 has a molecular mass of 28 kDa, is monomeric, and can hydrolyze all beta-lactams except aztreonam. Compared to VIM-2, NDM-1 displays tighter binding to most cephalosporins, in particular, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, and cephalothin (cefalotin), and also to the penicillins. NDM-1 does not bind to the carbapenems as tightly as IMP-1 or VIM-2 and turns over the carbapenems at a rate similar to that of VIM-2. In addition to K. pneumoniae 05-506, bla(NDM-1) was found on a 140-kb plasmid in an Escherichia coli strain isolated from the patient's feces, inferring the possibility of in vivo conjugation.

Two isolates carrying both VIM and KPC were isolated in two consecutive months in 2009, but not since. The prevalence of CPKP increased from 0{\%} in 2003 to 38.3{\%} in 2010 (p c;0.0001). All genotyped KPC producers harboured blaKPC-2 and belonged to two clones, among which the hyperepidemic Greek clone, related to those from the United States and Israel, predominated. Most metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) producers carried the blaVIM-1 gene and belonged to several clones, whereas all but one isolate with blaVIM-12 were clustered within a five-month period, arising from one clone. Resistance to non-beta-lactam antibiotics was also increased among CPKP. They were almost invariably resistant to ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Resistance to colistin increased from 3.5{\%} (4/115) in 2008 to 20.8{\%} (25/120) in 2010, and resistance to tigecycline also increased. Following reinforcement of infection control measures, prevalence of CPKP (mainly KPC) has been reduced since mid-2009 (from 46{\%} in 2009 to 38.3{\%} in 2010).

We describe an outbreak of OXA-181-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae in a 275 bedded acute general hospital in Singapore. Methods: A patient who was managed in a 24 bedded, Male, Geriatric, Transition {\&} Rehabilitation unit had a blood culture positive for Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to Imipenem and Meropenem (MIC 6.000mg/L and 24.000mg/L ) on 24 January 2013. Contact tracing with rectal swabs was done for all patients in the same cubicle and then ward. The ward and adjacent gym were closed, CRE patients were isolated in single rooms, patient areas and bathroom facilities were cleaned and disinfected. Hand hygiene and isolation education were reinforced to all healthcare staff. All patients were swabbed during outpatient follow up and during readmission. The unit was reopened after 12 days when no new cases of CRE were identified from remaining patient contacts. All positive CRE isolates were sent to a reference laboratory for further typing. Results: Two of five (40{\%}) patients who had stayed in the same 6- bedded cubicle as the index case were found to have CRE. Three of 9 (33{\%}) of the rest of the ward patients were CRE positive. A further two contacts had CRE detected in urine specimens 4 days and a week later. Overall, the attack rate for patients in the same cubicle was 3/6 (50{\%}) and ward was 3/9 (33{\%}). A screen of the adjacent ward did not identify any CRE patients among 18 screened. All isolates were identical by Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis bearing blaOXA-181. Conclusion: This strain of OXA-181-producing Klebsiella pneumonia has clear outbreak potential.

512,maybe,alghoribi2015,article,"OBJECTIVES: We investigated the molecular epidemiology of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) from a tertiary care hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, revealing, for the first time, the population structure of UPEC in the region. METHODS: A total of 202 UPEC isolates were recovered from hospital and community patients with urinary tract infection in December 2012 and January 2013. Strains were characterized by MLST, antibiotic susceptibility determination and virulence gene detection. RESULTS: The most common lineages were ST131 (17.3{\%}), ST73 (11.4{\%}), ST38 (7.4{\%}), ST69 (7.4{\%}), ST10 (6.4{\%}), ST127 (5.9{\%}), ST95 (5.4{\%}), ST12 (3.5{\%}), ST998 (3.5{\%}) and ST405 (3{\%}). ST131 and ST405 isolates were significantly associated with high levels of antibiotic resistance (60{\%} of ST131 carried CTX-M-14 or CTX-M-15 and 66.7{\%} of ST405 isolates carried CTX-M-15). ST131, CTX-M-15-positive isolates were predominantly of the fimH30/clade C group, resistant to fluoroquinolones; members of this sub-group were more likely to carry a high number of genes encoding selected virulence determinants. The relatively high proportion of ST38 was notable and four of these isolates harboured aggR. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the presence of MDR, CTX-M-positive ST38, ST131 and ST405 UPEC in Saudi Arabia. The high proportion of isolates with CTX-M is a particular concern.

Methods: A 37-year-old woman was hospitalised in May of 2009 for an open fracture grade III of the right tibial pilon. External fixator were placed and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin (SARM) were isolated from the wound. The patient got better and two months later, the patient was discharged with a treatment consisting on levofloxacin+rifampin due to a new isolation of SARM in the wound. In March of 2010, the patient returned to the hospital with an acute clinical pictures of suppuration through an ankle fistula. A surgery resection of the distal end of the tibia, affected by osteomyelitis, was done. The wound and surgical bone tissue specimens were processed. Results: Gram-negative bacillus was isolated from both, wound exudates and bone samples. The isolate was identified as A. hydrophila by both phenotypic and genotyopic methods. The isolate showed resistance to ampicillin, cefazolin, cefotaxime, cefepime, gentamicin, tobramycin and ciprofloxacin; decreased susceptibility to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ceftazidime and aztreonam; and susceptibility to cotrimoxazole, amikacin, piperacillin/tazobactam and carbapenems. Clavulanic acid recovered the activity of cefotaxime and ceftazidime. The patient was successfully treated with meropenem+amikacin. Standard PCR conditions were used to amplify the genes blaTEM, blaSHV, blaCTX-M and blaOXA; sequence analysis of PCR products obtained identified TEM-1 and CTX-M-15 ESBL, no PCR products were obtained using the remaining primers.

Methods: The outbreak occured during the period 15 to 29 March,2005. A newborn infected with S. typhimurium was defined as a case. Newborns who were hospitalized during the outbreak period with no diagnosis of S. typhimurium infections (n=50) constituted the control group I (CG I). The matched patients of the control group II (CG II) (n=20) were selected from neonates without S. typhimurium infections during the period. Results: Of 22 infants who were affected two died. Cases developed diarrhea (n=20), septicemia (n=5) and meningtis (n=1). The strain was resistant to ampicillin, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, amikacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxasole and chloromphenicol, susceptible to meropenem. All of the infected neonates were treated with meropenem. The surveillance cultures were negative. The outbreak was controlled by approprite therapy and institution of effective control measures. The cases were more exposed to mechanical ventilation than CG I (p{\textless}0.05). The mean additional length of stay in cases was significantly different from CG II (14.9 days vs. 5.1 days, p{\textless}0.05).

1139,yes,atmaca2014,article,"The aim of this study was to evaluate methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia cases who were followed at the Infectious Diseases Unit of Internal Medicine Department, at Hacettepe University Adult and Oncology Hospitals between January 2004-December 2011. A total of 198 patients, of them 99 had positive MRSA blood cultures (case group), and 99 without MRSA bacteremia (control group) who were selected randomly among patients at the same wards during the same time period, were included in the study. Demographic data, risk factors for MRSA bacteremia and antibiotic use of case (60 male, 39 female; mean age: 59.37 +/- 16.96 yrs) and control (60 male, 39 female; mean age: 59.11 +/- 17.60 yrs) groups were obtained from the patient files and the hospital data system and were compared. Methicillin susceptibility was determined by the cefoxitin (30 microg, BD, USA) disc diffusion method and confirmed by mecA PCR test. Antimicrobial susceptibilities were also determined by disc diffusion and Etest (BioMerieux, France) methods according to CLSI guidelines. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups according to age, gender, presence of an underlying chronic disease, burn, hemodialysis, malignancy or immunosupression (p{\textgreater} 0.05). The results of the univariate analysis revealed that antibiotic use and parameters most likely to be associated with MRSA bacteremia (obesity, cerebrovascular event, hospitalization history, central/arterial catheter, presence of tracheostomy, invasive/non-invasive mechanical ventilation, use of proton pump inhibitors, H2 receptor blockers, sucralfate, nasogastric or urinary tubes, gastrostomia, total parenteral nutrition, acute organ failure and surgical operation) were found to be statistically higher in the case group (p{\textless} 0.05). Median length of hospital stay was also higher in the case group (59 days versus 8 days; p{\textless} 0.001). Multivariate regression analysis indicated that obesity (OR= 7.98; p= 0.013), central venous catheterization (OR= 6.65; p= 0.005), nasogastric tube (OR= 16.58; p{\textless} 0.001) and use of H2 receptor blockers (OR= 4.41; p= 0.010) were independent risk factors. The number of patient given at least one antibiotic (92 in case group, 51 in control group) was statistically higher than those who were not (48 in case group, 7 in control group) (OR= 14.86; p{\textless} 0.001). Use of antibiotics [ampicillin-sulbactam and/or amoxicillin-clavulanate, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, piperacillin-tazobactam (TZP), meropenem (MEM), imipenem (IPM), vancomycin (VAN), cephalosporins and teicoplanin (TEC)] were found to be statistically significantly higher in the case group by univariate analysis (p{\textless} 0.05). In multivariate analysis, it was determined that TZP (OR= 6.82; p{\textless} 0.001), IPM (OR= 3.97; p= 0.023) and VAN (OR= 8.46; p= 0.001) use were independent risk factors in MRSA bacteremia. The duration of MEM (p= 0.037) and cephalosporin use (p{\textless} 0.001) were significantly longer in the case group, however there was no statistically significant difference between the duration of use of other antibiotics (p{\textgreater} 0.05). All MRSA isolates were mecA gene positive (n= 99), the resistance rates for ciprofloxacin, rifampin, gentamicin, tetracyclin, cefoxitin, erythromycin and clindamycin were 95{\%}, 95{\%}, 94{\%}, 96{\%}, 98{\%}, 71{\%} and 36{\%}, respectively. All of the isolates were found to be susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, VAN, TEC, tigecycline, linezolid and daptomycin. Mortality rates in patients who were infected with MRSA strains exhibiting vancomycin MIC value of {\textless}/= 1.0 microg/ml (n= 49) and with MRSA strains exhibiting MIC {\textgreater} 1.0 microg/ml (n= 50) were 34.6{\%} (17/49) and 60{\%} (30/50), respectively. This difference was found to be statistically significant (p= 0.012). Thus it was concluded that the mortality rate increased in patients infected with MRSA with high ({\textgreater} 1.0 microg/ml) vancomycin MIC value. The results of this study indicated that obesity, presence of central venous catheter and nasogastric tube, and the use of H2 receptor blockers, IPM, TZP and VAN were independent risk factors for MRSA bacteremia.

1165,maybe,aung2015,article,"BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the most serious health problems in Myanmar. Because TB drug resistance is associated with genetic mutation(s) relevant to responses to each drug, genotypic methods for detecting these mutations have been proposed to overcome the limitations of classic phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST). We explored the current estimates of drug-resistant TB and evaluated the usefulness of genotypic DST in Myanmar. METHODS: We determined the drug susceptibility of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated from sputum smear-positive patients with newly diagnosed pulmonary TB at two main TB centers in Myanmar during 2013 by using conventional phenotypic DST and the GenoType MTBDRplus assay (Hain Lifescience, Germany). Discrepant results were confirmed by sequencing the genes relevant to each type of resistance (rpoB for rifampicin; katG and inhA for isoniazid). RESULTS: Of 191 isolates, phenotypic DST showed that 27.7{\%} (n=53) were resistant to at least one first-line drug and 20.9{\%} (n=40) were resistant to two or more, including 18.3{\%} (n=35) multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) strains. Monoresistant strains accounted for 6.8{\%} (n=13) of the samples. Genotypic assay of 189 isolates showed 17.5{\%} (n=33) MDR-TB and 5.3{\%} (n=10) isoniazid-monoresistant strains. Genotypic susceptibility results were 99.5{\%} (n=188) concordant and agreed almost perfectly with phenotypic DST (kappa=0.99; 95{\%} confidence interval 0.96-1.01).

1354,yes,baker2015,article,"BACKGROUND: Shigellosis is an acute, severe bacterial colitis that, in high-income countries, is typically associated with travel to high-risk regions (Africa, Asia, and Latin America). Since the 1970s, shigellosis has also been reported as a sexually transmitted infection in men who have sex with men (MSM), in whom transmission is an important component of shigellosis epidemiology in high-income nations. We aimed to use sophisticated subtyping and international sampling to determine factors driving shigellosis emergence in MSM linked to an outbreak in the UK. METHODS: We did a large-scale, cross-sectional genomic epidemiological study of shigellosis cases collected from 29 countries between December, 1995, and June 8, 2014. Focusing on an ongoing epidemic in the UK, we collected and whole-genome sequenced clinical isolates of Shigella flexneri serotype 3a from high-risk and low-risk regions, including cases associated with travel and sex between men. We examined relationships between geographical, demographic, and clinical patient data with the isolate antimicrobial susceptibility, genetic data, and inferred evolutionary relationships. FINDINGS: We obtained 331 clinical isolates of S flexneri serotype 3a, including 275 from low-risk regions (44 from individuals who travelled to high-risk regions), 52 from high-risk regions, and four outgroup samples (ie, closely related, but genetically distinct isolates used to determine the root of the phylogenetic tree). We identified a recently emerged lineage of S flexneri 3a that has spread intercontinentally in less than 20 years throughout regions traditionally at low risk for shigellosis via sexual transmission in MSM. The lineage had acquired multiple antimicrobial resistance determinants, and prevailing sublineages were strongly associated with resistance to the macrolide azithromycin. Eight (4{\%}) of 206 isolates from the MSM-associated lineage were obtained from patients who had previously provided an isolate; these serial isolations indicated atypical infection patterns (eg, reinfection). INTERPRETATION: We identified transmission-facilitating behaviours and atypical course(s) of infection as precipitating factors in shigellosis-affected MSM. The intercontinental spread of antimicrobial-resistant shigella through established transmission routes emphasises the need for new approaches to tackle the public health challenge of sexually transmitted infections in MSM.

1362,yes,bakour2014a,article,"PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to characterize the molecular support of resistance to carbapenems, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones in carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates recovered between January 2011 and April 2013 from Algerian hospitals. METHODS: Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed using disk diffusion and Etest methods. Carbapenemase activity was detected using both MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry assay and via microbiological tests. Carbapenem, aminoglycoside and fluoroquinolone resistance determinants were studied by PCR and sequencing. Clonal relationships between strains were determined using Multi Locus Sequence Typing (MLST). RESULTS: A total of 47 imipenem-resistant A. baumannii were isolated and identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. All imipenem-resistant strains were positive in the modified Hodge test, and EDTA inhibited the activity of metallo-beta-lactamases enzymes in 11 strains. The blaOXA-23 gene was detected in 33 strains and the blaOXA-24 gene in 10 strains. The metallo-beta-lactamase blaNDM-1 gene was detected in 11 isolates (23.4{\%}) from Algiers and Setif, including 7 that co-expressed a blaOXA-23 gene. Resistance to aminoglycosides was due to the production of aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes, AAC(3)-Ia, AADA, ANT(2'')-I, APH(3')-VI, and 16S rRNA methylases, ArmA. The fluoroquinolone resistance was mainly associated with mutations at Ser83Leu and Ser80Leu of the gyrA and parC genes, respectively. MLST revealed five sequence types (STs), 1, 2, 19, 25, and 85. The imipenem-resistant A. baumannii ST2 was the predominant clone (35/47).

Objective: Present study was undertaken to de-termine any change in isolation and serotype switching of Shigella and monitor their antimi-crobial resistance over a 5 year period( 2006-2011) .and compare with our previous study .( 2001-2006). A total of 2100 faecal samples from patients with diarrhea were processed ( 2006- 2011). Isolates identified by standard microbiological techniques as Shigella spp .Disk diffusion meth-od for antimicrobial susceptibility performed using CLSI guidelines. Of the 2100 samples , 77(3.66{\%}) were Shigella spp. Further predominance of Shigella flexnerii was noted over the other serogroups . 3 out of 77 Shigella were S sonnei and one S dysen-triae1. 100{\%} resistance was noted against Nali-dixic acid and significant increase in resistance seen with Ampicillin(100{\%}),,Co-trimoxazole( 89.6{\%}), Tetracycline( 84.4{\%}), Ciprofloxacin( 87{\%})and Norfloxacin ( 83.1{\%}).

Shigella flexneri was the predominant serogroup (94.8{\%}) and Shigella flexneri 2a the frequently isolated in our study .This was in synchrony with our previous study and studies elsewhere. Two isolates were re-sistant to cephalosporins and this is an alarm ,signaling the emergence of cephalosporin resis-tance in this region of the country. Antibiotic treatment is recommended for shigello-sis as it reduces the duration,severity ,excretion of organisms and prevents lethal complications.

2667,maybe,brooke2012,article,"Summary: Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is an emerging multidrug-resistant global opportunistic pathogen. The increasing incidence of nosocomial and community-acquired S. maltophilia infections is of particular concern for immunocompromised individuals, as this bacterial pathogen is associated with a significant fatality/case ratio. S. maltophilia is an environmental bacterium found in aqueous habitats, including plant rhizospheres, animals, foods, and water sources. Infections of S. maltophilia can occur in a range of organs and tissues; the organism is commonly found in respiratory tract infections. This review summarizes the current literature and presents S. maltophilia as an organism with various molecular mechanisms used for colonization and infection. S. maltophilia can be recovered from polymicrobial infections, most notably from the respiratory tract of cystic fibrosis patients, as a cocolonizer with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Recent evidence of cell-cell communication between these pathogens has implications for the development of novel pharmacological therapies. Animal models of S. maltophilia infection have provided useful information about the type of host immune response induced by this opportunistic pathogen. Current and emerging treatments for patients infected with S. maltophilia are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2012, American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved.",J S Brooke,"0893-8512

2697,yes,brown2007,article,"OBJECTIVES: In this study, we assessed the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and prevalence of methicillin resistance among Staphylococcus aureus isolates from hospital and community sources in southern Jamaica. METHODS: Eighty isolates of S. aureus obtained from hospital and community-based patients with staphylococcal infections were collected, and antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined by disk diffusion. RESULTS: While all specimens yielded isolates, multidrug-resistant isolates were obtained only from urine, high vaginal swab, abscess aspirate, and catheter tip samples. The overall prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was 23{\%}. The proportions of MRSA isolated from hospital sources (18/39) and community sources were 46{\%} and 0{\%}, respectively (p{\textless}0.05). The pattern of antibiotic susceptibility of S. aureus differed significantly between MRSA and methicillin-susceptible (MSSA) isolates. For MRSA isolates, multiple-drug resistance was common and only few antibiotics were active against these isolates. However, no MRSA was resistant to vancomycin. Except for penicillin and to some extent co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), most MSSA isolates were susceptible to nearly all antimicrobial agents used in this study. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of MRSA from this region of Jamaica. Because methicillin resistance is associated with multiple-drug resistance in S. aureus, it is imperative that surveillance initiatives be focused on both the hospital and community in order to monitor and limit the spread of this organism.",P D Brown and C Ngeno,"1201-9712 (print)

2897,yes,cabrera2009,article,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Soon after the introduction of extended-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics to treat infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria that were resistant to the existing beta-lactams, resistant strains quickly emerged. This study investigated the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns, conjugative transferability, and molecular characterization of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae in the Philippines. METHODS: ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae were collected from patients at the Philippine General Hospital from June 2000 to August 2001. The antimicrobial susceptibility patterns were determined using the standard disk diffusion assay. ESBL production was confirmed using the double-disk synergy assay and the E-test, while the ESBLs were characterized for type using polymerase chain reaction, sequencing, and isoelectric focusing. Conjugation studies were conducted in vitro on solid medium. RESULTS: All of the ESBL-producing isolates were also resistant to most other classes of antimicrobials studied. The ESBL genes on conjugative and non-conjugative plasmids were bla(SHV-12). Fifteen isolates also carried bla(TEM-1). None of the isolates were positive for the CTX-M type of ESBL. Plasmids from cefoxitin-resistant isolates did not produce amplified products using CMY primers for the AmpC gene. CONCLUSIONS: SHV-12 is the dominating ESBL among the Enterobacteriaceae studied. The gene bla(SHV-12) is carried together with genes for multiple resistance to other classes of antimicrobials in conjugative and nonconjugative plasmids.",E C Cabrera and R D Rodriguez,1684-1182,J Microbiol Immunol Infect,"Conjugation, Genetic,Drug Resistance, Bacterial/*genetics,Enterobacteriaceae Infections/*microbiology,Enterobacteriaceae/*enzymology/genetics,Humans,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Philippines,beta-Lactamases/*genetics",74--85,{First report on the occurrence of SHV-12 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in the Philippines},NA,42,2009,1,"1995-9133

3225,yes,cassir2013,article,"Introduction. Nocardial infections, although rare, are challenging for clinicians to treat. Recent contradictory reports of sulfonamide resistance have raised concerns about using this drug to treat nocardial infections. Case presentation. A 62-year-old immunocompetent Caucasian woman showed disseminated pulmonary nodules and a brain abscess by chest computed tomography and brain magnetic resonance imaging, respectively. Multidrug-resistant Nocardia wallacei was cultured from a stereotactic brain biopsy and confirmed by 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid gene sequencing. After the first-line treatment failed, a long course of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was prescribed with no evidence of recurrence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a Nocardia wallacei disseminated infection in an immunocompetent patient, and it is the first detailed description of successful treatment with trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole despite the resistance observed in vitro. Conclusion: Species identification of clinical isolates is critical for diagnosis, a prediction of antimicrobial susceptibility and epidemiological tracking. In the case of Nocardia wallacei, the clinical outcome suggests that sulfonamides can be used for treatment despite ambiguous results from in vitro susceptibility tests. {\textcopyright} 2013 Cassir et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",N Cassir and M Million and R Noudel and M Drancourt and P Brouqui,1752-1947,Journal of Medical Case Reports,"C reactive protein,Caucasian,Nocardia,Nocardia wallacei,RNA 16S,RNA sequence,adult,ambient air,amikacin,antibiotic resistance,antibiotic sensitivity,antibiotic therapy,article,ataxic aphasia,bacterium culture,bacterium identification,bacterium isolate,bacterium isolation,blood toxicity,brain abscess,brain biopsy,broth dilution,case report,ceftriaxone,ciprofloxacin,computer assisted tomography,contrast enhancement,cotrimoxazole,craniotomy,diffusion weighted imaging,drug eruption,drug substitution,drug treatment failure,drug withdrawal,dyspnea,female,fiberoptic bronchoscopy,follow up,frontal lobe,headache,human,human tissue,imipenem,immunocompetence,in vitro study,linezolid,long term care,lung lavage,lung nodule,minimum inhibitory concentration,moxifloxacin,multidrug resistance,neuroimaging,neutropenia,nocardiosis,nuclear magnetic resonance imaging,nucleotide sequence,parietal lobe,pleura effusion,pleurisy,pneumonia,prescription,priority journal,recurrent infection,stereotactic biopsy,sulfonamide,surgical drainage,thorax pain,thorax radiography,treatment duration,treatment withdrawal,urban area",NA,{Sulfonamide resistance in a disseminated infection caused by Nocardia wallacei: A case report},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l52538162 http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1752-1947-7-103 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=17521947{\&}id=doi:10.1186{\%}2f1752-1947-7-103{\&}atitle=sulfonamide+resista,7,2013,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,yes,allison,yes,nchedo,nchedo,zach,yes,zm_5.csv,NA,NA,zm_5_1.mex,yes,journal

In this report, a rifampicin-resistant M.bovis BCG strain isolated from an infant with NEMO defect was presented. An 8-month-old male infant with NEMO defect admitted to the pediatric outpatient clinic of our hospital with fever, generalized lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly. Microscopic examination of the smears prepared from lymph node and liver biopsy specimens revealed abundant amount (3+) of acid-fast bacilli (AFB). Rifampicin-susceptible Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) was detected by real-time PCR (GeneXpert MTB/RIF; Cepheid, USA) in the samples. The growth of mycobacteria was determined on the 20th day of culture performed in MGIT960 system (Becton Dickinson, USA). The isolate was identified as M.bovis BCG by GenoType MTBC kit (Hain Lifescience, Germany) and defined as M.bovis BCG [SIT 482 (BOV{\_}1)] by spoligotyping. In the primary anti-tuberculosis drug susceptibility test performed by MGIT960 system, the isolate was found susceptible to rifampicin (RIF), isoniazid (INH), streptomycin (STM) and ethambutol (EMB). Then anti-tuberculosis treatment was started to the patient. However, the patient at the age of 2 years, re-admitted to the hospital with the complaint of hepatosplenomegaly. Smear of spontaneously draining abscess material obtained from subcutaneous nodules revealed intensive AFB positivity (3+) once again. In the present instance RIF-resistant MTC was detected with GeneXpert system in the specimen. The growth of mycobacteria was determined on the 13th day of culture and isolate was identified as M.bovis BCG. The present isolate was found susceptible to INH, STM and EMB but resistant to RIF. A mutation in the rpoB gene (codon 531, S531L) associated with RIF resistance was detected by using the partial sequencing of the rpoB gene. Patient died due to disseminated bovis BCG infection and multiple organ failure. To our knowledge, there are only six RIF-resistant M.bovis BCG strains isolated from patients in the literature.

3651,maybe,chen2016f,article,"OBJECTIVES: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a major public health concern worldwide. This is the first nationwide study, performed within the China Gonococcal Antimicrobial Susceptibility Programme (China-GASP), regarding AMR, including ceftriaxone genetic resistance determinants, and molecular epidemiology of gonococci in China. METHODS: Gonococcal isolates (n = 1257) from consecutive patients were collected at 11 sentinel sites distributed across China during 2012-13. Susceptibility to ceftriaxone, spectinomycin, ciprofloxacin and tetracycline was determined using the agar dilution method. Ceftriaxone resistance determinants penA and penB were examined using sequencing. N. gonorrhoeae multiantigen sequence typing (NG-MAST) was performed for molecular epidemiology. RESULTS: Among isolates, 0.2{\%} were resistant to spectinomycin, 4.4{\%} to ceftriaxone, 42.9{\%} to tetracyclines (high-level resistance) and 99.8{\%} to ciprofloxacin. Among 890 sequenced isolates, 16 (1.8{\%}) possessed a penA mosaic allele; 4 of these isolates belonged to the MDR internationally spread NG-MAST genogroup G1407 (first description in China). Non-mosaic penA alleles with an A501T mutation and an A102D alteration in porB1b were statistically associated with decreased susceptibility/resistance to ceftriaxone. NG-MAST G10339, G1424 and G1053 were associated with decreased susceptibility/resistance to ceftriaxone. CONCLUSIONS: In China, ceftriaxone and spectinomycin can continue to be recommended for gonorrhoea treatment, with the possible exception of Hainan and Sichuan provinces where ceftriaxone resistance exceeded 5{\%} and AMR surveillance needs to be strengthened. Molecular approaches including genotyping and AMR determinant analysis can be valuable to supplement and enhance conventional surveillance of gonococcal AMR in China.",S C Chen and Y P Yin and X Q Dai and M Unemo and X S Chen,0305-7453,J Antimicrob Chemother,"*beta-Lactam Resistance,Adolescent,Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology,Ceftriaxone/*pharmacology,China/epidemiology,DNA, Bacterial/chemistry/genetics,Female,Genes, Bacterial,Genotype,Gonorrhea/*epidemiology/microbiology,Humans,Male,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Middle Aged,Molecular Epidemiology,Multilocus Sequence Typing,Neisseria gonorrhoeae/*classification/*drug effect,Sequence Analysis, DNA,Young Adult,purification",92--99,{First nationwide study regarding ceftriaxone resistance and molecular epidemiology of Neisseria gonorrhoeae in China},NA,71,2016,1,"1460-2091

Methods Eight cases of infection with gonococci exhibiting azithromycin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) â¥256 â¬..mg/L were identified from patients in Leeds as part of the routine service provided by the Sexually Transmitted Bacteria Reference Unit. All patient records were reviewed to collate epidemiological and clinical information including evaluation of patient management. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on seven gonococcal isolates to determine Neisseria gonorrhoeae multiantigen sequence type (NG-MAST), WGS comparison and mutations in the 23S rRNA genes. Results All patients were heterosexual (five male, three female) from a range of ethnic backgrounds and from the Leeds area. Three patients were linked by partner notification. All patients were infected at genital sites and two women had pharyngeal infection also. Six patients received the recommended first-line therapy for uncomplicated gonorrhoea, one was treated for pelvic inflammatory disease and one received spectinomycin followed later by ciprofloxacin. Test of cure was achieved in seven patients and confirmed successful eradication. All seven isolates sequenced were identical by NG-MAST and WGS comparison, and contained an A2143G mutation in all four 23S rRNA alleles. Conclusions Epidemiological and microbiological investigations confirm that an outbreak of a gonococcal strain showing HL-AziR is ongoing in the North of England.

After the index case was detected in an 18-bed medical intermediate care unit, a number of interventions was implemented, including targeted active surveillance for VRE, strict contact precautions, enhanced standard precautions, dedicated units for VRE cases, extensive cleaning of the environment and the restricted use of antibiotics. VRE isolates were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) testing. A prevalence case-control study was conducted. Among 3,699 culture samples from 2,671 patients screened, 74 patients (2.8{\%}) had VRE. The positivity rate declined from 15.1{\%} during week 1 to 8.2{\%} during week 2 and then 1.4{\%} during week 3. By weeks 4-9, the prevalences were 0-2.7{\%}. However, the prevalence rose to 9.4{\%} during week 10 and then subsequently declined. All VRE isolates were Enterococcus faecium and had the vanA gene. RAPD analysis revealed a single predominant clone. Multivariate analysis showed mechanical ventilation for â¥ 7 days was a predictive factor for VRE colonization [odds ratio (OR) 11.47; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 1.75-75.35; p = 0.011].

3910,maybe,chrisment2012,article,"OBJECTIVES: Mycoplasma genitalium is a sexually transmitted organism associated with non-gonococcal urethritis in men and several inflammatory reproductive tract syndromes in women. Resistance to macrolides has been recently associated with point mutations in the 23S rRNA gene. The aim of this study was to detect these mutations using a large French collection of M. genitalium-positive specimens. We evaluated whether these mutations were related to azithromycin treatment failure and whether macrolide-resistant M. genitalium may be spreading. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study conducted in France between 2003 and 2010 included 156 urogenital clinical specimens from 136 patients that were positive for M. genitalium. Mutations in domain V of M. genitalium 23S rRNA were detected using amplification and sequencing. The mutated strains were genotyped by studying single nucleotide polymorphisms in the mgpB gene. RESULTS: We have detected macrolide resistance-associated mutations in M. genitalium since 2006 at a rate of 13.2{\%}, ranging from 10{\%} to 15.4{\%} of patients per year. Nine mutations at position 2059 as well as two A2058G substitutions, one A2062T substitution and one C2038T substitution (Escherichia coli numbering) were identified in M. genitalium. These patients had treatment failure with azithromycin in 75{\%} (6/8) of cases. For one patient, genotyping showed selection for the mutation during treatment with azithromycin. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, we describe macrolide resistance for M. genitalium in France and demonstrate that its detection has increased since 2006.

4775,maybe,defrancesco2014,article,"Primary clarithromycin resistance is the main factor affecting the efficacy of Helicobacter pylori therapy. This study aimed: (i) to assess the concordance between phenotypic (culture) and genotypic (real-time PCR) tests in resistant strains; (ii) to search, in the case of disagreement between the methods, for point mutations other than those reported as the most frequent in Europe; and (iii) to compare the MICs associated with the single point mutations. In order to perform real-time PCR, we retrieved biopsies from patients in whom H. pylori infection was successful diagnosed by bacterial culture and clarithromycin resistance was assessed using the Etest. Only patients who had never been previously treated, and with H. pylori strains that were either resistant exclusively to clarithromycin or without any resistance, were included. Biopsies from 82 infected patients were analysed, including 42 strains that were clarithromycin resistant and 40 that were clarithromycin susceptible on culture. On genotypic analysis, at least one of the three most frequently reported point mutations (A2142C, A2142G and A2143G) was detected in only 23 cases (54.8{\%}), with a concordance between the two methods of 0.67. Novel point mutations (A2115G, G2141A and A2144T) were detected in a further 14 out of 19 discordant cases, increasing the resistance detection rate of PCR to 88{\%} (P{\textless}0.001; odds ratio 6.1, 95{\%} confidence interval 218.6) and the concordance to 0.81. No significant differences in MIC values among different point mutations were observed. This study suggests that: (i) the prevalence of the usually reported point mutations may be decreasing, with a concomitant emergence of new mutations; (ii) PCR-based methods should search for at least six point mutations to achieve good accuracy in detecting clarithromycin resistance; and (iii) none of the tested point mutations is associated with significantly higher MIC values than the others. {\textcopyright} 2014 SGM.",V {De Francesco} and A Zullo and F Giorgio and I Saracino and C Zaccaro and C Hassan and E Ierardi and A {Di Leo} and G Fiorini and V Castelli and G {Lo Re} and D Vaira and G L Re and D Vaira,0022-2615,Journal of Medical Microbiology,",*Point Mutation,Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology,Bacterial/genetics,Clarithromycin/*pharmacology,DNA,Drug Resistance,Genotype,Helicobacter Infections/epidemiology/*microbiology,Helicobacter infection,Helicobacter pylori,Helicobacter pylori/drug effects/*genetics,Humans,Italy,Italy/epidemiology,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Phenotype,RNA,Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction,Ribosomal/*genetics,Ribosomal/genetics,antibiotic resistance,antibiotic sensitivity,article,bacterial gene,bacterial mutation,bacterial strain,bacterium culture,clarithromycin,controlled study,epsilometer test,genotype,human,human tissue,major clinical study,minimum inhibitory concentration,phenotype,point mutation,priority journal,real time polymerase chain reaction,ribosome RNA",453--457,{Change of point mutations in Helicobacter pylori rRNA associated with clarithromycin resistance in Italy},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l372479110 http://dx.doi.org/10.1099/jmm.0.067942-0 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=00222615{\&}id=doi:10.1099{\%}2fjmm.0.067942-0{\&}atitle=change+of+point+muta,63,2014,pt 3,"from duplicate 2 (change of point mutations in helicobacter pylori rrna associated with clarithromycin resistance in italy - de francesco, v; zullo, a; giorgio, f; saracino, i; zaccaro, c; hassan, c; ierardi, e; di leo, a; fiorini, g; castelli, v; lo re, g; vaira, d)

4990,maybe,demartini2016,article,"Learning Objectives: Kytococcus schroeteri is a new genus separate from, but similar to, Micrococcus. It is a Gram-positive, non-encapsulated organism. Culture isolates may be dismissed as contaminants; however, Kytococcus is highly virulent in immunocompromised patients. In this report we discuss the first pediatric immunocompromised patient with Kytococcus schroeteri. Methods: Our patient was a 17 year old male with Myelodysplastic Syndrome who developed fever, hypoxia, hypotension and acute kidney injury. A blood culture grew Grampositive cocci in clusters which were identified as Micrococcus species and but later speciated as Kytococcus. Antibiotics were changed from a fourth generation cephalosporin to a glycopeptide and carbapenem. Despite high frequency oscillation and aggressive resuscitation of shock, he progressed to multiple organ failure and death. Kytococcus is usually regarded as a skin or mucosal contaminant. Recently, Kytococcus has become recognized as pathogen in immunocompromised adults and patients with prosthetics. Patients with immunosuppression overwhelmingly succumb to the infection; however those with indwelling prosthetics tend to survive. Kytococcus is often suspected when Micrococcus is found to be resistant to penicillin and oxacillin. Kytococcus has been shown to be resistant to beta-lactams and macrolides; sensitive to vancomycin, teicoplanin, rifampicin, imipenem, tetracycline, gentamicin, and linezolid; and variably resistant to quinolones. Results: In this report we discuss the first pediatric immunocompromised patient with a recently identified organism, Kytococcus schroeteri.

A 28-year-old HIV-positive male presented with a high fever, non-productive cough, right subcostal pain, splenomegaly, a very low CD4 count, elevated C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and a normal white blood cell count. The suspicion of tuberculosis (TB) was very high, and sputum samples were positive for acid-fast bacilli. Standard quadruple anti-TB therapy was initiated, but once culture of the sample revealed Mycobacterium kansasii, pyrazinamide was withdrawn. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was initiated soon after, consisting of abacavir/lamivudine and efavirenz. The patient's general condition deteriorated 2 weeks after HAART initiation, which could have been due to the development of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). The patient recovered and was discharged in good condition. However, the results of resistance testing of the isolated organism arrived after discharge, and showed isoniazid and streptomycin resistance.

5251,maybe,dimitrov2006,article,"Objective: To present the first documented case of acute infectious gastroenteritis caused by high-level ceftriaxone-resistant Salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium in Kuwait. Subject and Methods: Isolation from stool specimen and species identification of current enteric pathogen was carried out according to standard methods. Susceptibility to antibiotics was determined by the disc diffusion method on Mueller-Hinton agar. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were measured with E-test strips. The production of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) was studied by the double disc synergy method and E-test ESBL strips. Plasmid DNA isolation was performed by the rapid alkaline lysis method. Plasmid DNA was transferred by conjugation to a recipient strain of Escherichia coli. Results: The isolate of S. enterica serotype typhimurium was resistant to ceftriaxone (MIC {\textgreater}256 mg/l), cefotaxime and ceftazidime, and produced ESBL. Ceftriaxone and cefotaxime resistance were co-transferred on a 3.2-kb plasmid to the E. coli recipient strain. Loss of the 3.2-kb plasmid from the transconjugant resulted in the co-loss of ceftriaxone and cefotaxime resistance confirming the carriage of ceftriazone resistance on the 3.2-kb plasmid. Conclusion: Plasmid-mediated high-level resistance to ceftriaxone and ESBL production in Salmonella serotype typhimurium is an emerging problem among Salmonella that requires closer monitoring of antimicrobial resistance among these bacterial species.

Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MICs) were determined and genes sequenced at each stage. After 30days of vancomycin exposure, the strain attained maximum MIC (20mg/L) and was resistant to all antibiotics. Reversion to vancomycin susceptibility occurred 21days after removal. We observed mutations in vraS and graR during non-susceptibly development and novel stop codons in the reverted strain.

5361,maybe,dolejska2012,article,"Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular epidemiology of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae in a children oncological clinic in the Czech Republic. Methods: From June 2009 to January 2010 a total of 51 ESBLproducing isolates were obtained from rectal swab samples of thirty patients. Further characterization with regard to ESBL enzymes, plasmid-mediated quinolone-resistance genes (PMQR), multilocus sequence types (MLST) and plasmids was performed. Results: ESBL-producing strains were identified as Klebsiella pneumoniae (36), Escherichia coli (7), K. oxytoca (3), Enterobacter cloacae (3) and Citrobacter freundii (2). K. pneumoniae isolates belonged to seven MLST: 280, 321, 323, 419 and novel types 626, 627, 628. The multiresistant highly virulent epidemic E. coli O25b-ST131 clone was detected in one patient. The gene blaCTX-M-15 was found on large conjugative FIIK plasmids, considered as virulence plasmids specific for Klebsiella spp., along with blaTEM-1b, blaOXA-1, qnrB1, aac(6)-Ib-cr, strA, sul2, aac(3)-II and tetA in most isolates including the O25b-ST131 clone. Sequences of copA gene of all FIIK plasmids were identical and showed the allele type 6. Conclusion: Spreading of particular clones among patients and dissemination of FIIK plasmids among bacterial species were considered to be likely involved in the ESBL bacteria infections in the clinic.

5879,maybe,endimiani2011,article,"Linezolid (LZD)-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (LRSA) isolates were monitored from 2000 to 2009 in Cleveland, OH. LRSA first emerged in 2004 only in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, with 11 LRSA-infected CF patients being identified by 2009. LRSA was isolated from 8 of 77 CF patients with S. aureus respiratory tract infection treated with LZD from 2000 to 2006. Analysis of clinical data showed that the 8 CF patients with LRSA received more LZD courses (18.8 versus 5.9; P = 0.001) for a longer duration (546.5 versus 211.9 days; P {\textless} 0.001) and had extended periods of exposure to LZD (83.1 versus 30.1 days/year; P {\textless} 0.001) than the 69 with LZD-susceptible isolates. Five LRSA isolates included in the clinical analysis (2000 to 2006) and three collected in 2009 were available for molecular studies. Genotyping by repetitive extrapalindromic PCR and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed that seven of these eight LRSA strains from unique patients were genetically similar. By multilocus sequence typing, all LRSA isolates were included in clonal complex 5 (seven of sequence type 5 [ST5] and one of ST1788, a new single-locus variant of ST5). However, seven different variants were identified by spa typing. According to the Escherichia coli numbering system, seven LRSA isolates contained a G2576T mutation (G2603T, S. aureus numbering) in one to four of the five copies of domain V of the 23S rRNA genes. One strain also contained a mutation (C2461T, E. coli numbering) not previously reported. Two strains, including one without domain V mutations, possessed single amino acid substitutions (Gly152Asp or Gly139Arg) in the ribosomal protein L3 of the peptidyltransferase center, substitutions not previously reported in clinical isolates.

6058,maybe,fakih2014,article,"INTRODUCTION: Mycobacterium fortuitumsternal wound infection following cardiac surgery is a rare occurrence but has considerable morbidity because of emergence of resistant strains. We present a patient who was successfully treated for sternal wound infection caused by a Clarithromycin resistant M. fortuitum (CRMF). CASE PRESENTATION: A 62-year-old male with history of dyslipidemia, hypertension, asthma, and nicotine dependence underwent coronary artery bypass grafting and left ventricular aneurysmorrhaphy after having myocardial infarction. He developed a small wound at the cephalic end of the sternotomy scar draining thick, brown, odorless discharge three weeks postoperatively. He was immediately taken to the operating room for debridement of a track which was noticed extending from the cephalic end. No organisms were seen on direct staining but after two days, many acid fast bacilli were identified in the aerobic culture. Patient's empirical antibiotics were switched to clarithromycin, levofloxacin and linezolid. Two weeks after discharge, the organism was identified as Mycobacterium fortuitum by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) with resistance to clarithromycin and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (TMP/SMZ). With a six month course of levofloxacin and doxycycline, the patient had an excellent recovery including wound closure. No recurrence was noted during two years of follow-up. DISCUSSION: Infection due to M. fortuitum is often resistant to all the standard anti-tuberculosis drugs, but clarithromycin, TMP/SMZ, doxycycline, and ciprofloxacin are usually recommended in combination according to in the vitro sensitivity data. Many M. fortuitum used to be susceptible to clarithromycin, but studies have shown that all isolates of M. fortuitum contain an erythromycin methylase gene, erm, which may induce macrolide resistance and contribute in an emergence of clarithromycin resistant strains. Consequently combination therapy is recommended for M. fortuitum with at least two susceptible medications in the era of emerging CRMF. CONCLUSIONS: A high index of suspicion based on clinical presentation is essential to diagnose Clarithromycin resistant M. fortuitum (CRMF) post cardiac surgery sternal infection for proper long term therapy. Beside surgical debridement appropriate blend of antibiotics based on sensitivity will ensure complete healing and prevent recurrence.",H A M Fakih and S Ahmad and E Elueze,0012-3692,Chest,"Mycobacterium,Mycobacterium fortuitum,acid fast bacterium,antibiotic agent,asthma,ciprofloxacin,clarithromycin,coronary artery bypass graft,cotrimoxazole,debridement,doxycycline,drug therapy,dyslipidemia,erythromycin,follow up,gene,healing,heart infarction,heart surgery,high performance liquid chromatography,human,hypertension,infection,levofloxacin,linezolid,long term care,macrolide,male,methyltransferase,morbidity,operating room,organisms,patient,scar,staining,sternotomy,therapy,tobacco dependence,tuberculosis,wound,wound closure,wound infection",NA,{Emerging clarithromycin resistant mycobacterium fortuitum in post cardiac surgery sternal wound infection},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l71780482 http://dx.doi.org/10.1378/chest.1993853 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=00123692{\&}id=doi:10.1378{\%}2fchest.1993853{\&}atitle=emerging+clarithromycin,146,2014,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,yes,erica,no,mushtaq,ayomide,zach,no,zm_5.csv,could not find full-text,NA,NA,no,journal

To eradicate this micro-organism, numerous regimens containing various antimicrobial agents have been suggested. However, H pylori antimicrobial resistance is a leading factor to treatment failure and recurrence of the disease. The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of H pylori resistance to metronidazole, clarithromycin, tetracycline, amoxicillin, erythromycin and furazolidone in authors pediatric patients. METHODS: Antral biopsy of all pediatric patients with negative history of receiving anti-H pylori regimen and endoscopic findings of nodular gastritis or peptic ulcer without previous history of NSAID consumption, burning and trauma were performed for H pylori histology, urease test and culture. All positive cultures were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility. RESULTS: Twenty four patients (14 male and 10 female) between 3.5 and 14 years of age were culture positive. 54.16{\%} of the isolates were resistant to metronidazole, 8.33{\%} to amoxicillin, 4.16{\%} to erythromycin and 4.16{\%} to clarithromycin. None of authors patients were resistant to tetracycline and furazolidone. CONCLUSION: H. pylori antimicrobial resistance could be a major contributor to failure of H pylori eradication.

This study determined the antibiotic resistance and molecular epidemiology of CNSAb isolates from a referral burn center in Tehran, Iran. Sixty-nine CNSAb isolates were tested for susceptibility to antimicrobial agents using the E test methodology. Multiple locus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA), Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and multiplex PCR were performed. PCR assays tested for ambler classes A, B, and D $\beta$-lactamases. Detection of ISAba1, characterization of integrons, and biofilm formation were investigated. Fifty-three (77{\%}) isolates revealed XDR phenotypes. High prevalence of blaOXA-23-like (88{\%}) and blaPER-1 (54{\%}) were detected. ISAba1 was detected upstream of blaADC, blaOXA-23-like and blaOXA51-like genes in, 97, 42, and 26{\%} of isolates, respectively. Thirty-one (45{\%}) isolates were assigned to international clone (IC) variants. MLVA identified 56 distinct types with six clusters and 53 singleton genotypes. Forty previously known MLST sequence types forming 5 clonal complexes were identified. The Class 1 integron (class 1 integrons) gene was identified in 84{\%} of the isolates. The most prevalent (33{\%}) cassette combination was aacA4-catB8-aadA1. The IC variants were predominant in the A. baumannii lineage with the ability to form strong biofilms. The XDR-CNSAb from burned patients in Iran is resistant to various antimicrobials, including tigecycline. This study shows wide genetic diversity in CNSAb.

The aim of this study was to describe the first nosocomial bloodstream infection outbreak caused by Enterobacter ludwigii co-harbouring CTX-M-8, SHV-12 and TEM-15 in a NICU in a Venezuelan hospital. Initial bacterial identification was achieved by VITEK{\textregistered}2 system and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (VITEK{\textregistered} MS) and was subsequently confirmed by nucleotide sequencing of the 16S rDNA gene and hsp60 genotyping. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was determined by AST-GN-299 VITEK{\textregistered}2 system cards and Etest strips. Isolates were typed by repetitive element sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR). Detection of blaESBL genes was carried out by molecular methods. Plasmid analysis included Southern blot and restriction pattern analysis, with transferability of resistance genes being assessed by conjugation. ESBL-producing E. ludwigii isolates were recovered from three neonates with bloodstream infection from the NICU in a 21-day period. rep-PCR fingerprints were indistinguishable among all of the isolates, strongly suggesting spread of a clonal strain. All isolates carried an ca. 56Â kb conjugative plasmid harbouring the blaCTX-M-8, blaSHV-12 and blaTEM-15 genes. Considering that isolation of ESBL-producing E. ludwigii remains an unusual phenomenon, not previously reported in Venezuela, the results of this study reveal the potential role of E. ludwigii as an emerging pathogen and highlight the importance of microbiological surveillance and judicious antibiotic use as measures to curb the emergence and spread of ESBL-producing bacteria.",A Flores-Carrero and I Labrador and A Paniz-Mondolfi and D R Peaper and D Towle and M Araque,"2213-7173

7014,maybe,gartner2012,article,"During routine microbiological analysis of various clinical specimen from 20 outpatients and inpatients at the University of Saarland Medical Center, two species of Acinetobacter baumannii complex were isolated, and confirmed using conventional microbiology and mass spectrometry. Antimicrobial resistance testing revealed resistance to all betalactams tested including carbapenems. Between mid-April and mid-June, 2012, positive specimens were identified either sporadically, or in temporal clusters. Apart from two control specimen (rectal swabs for surveillance of neonates), all other patients either revealed one or several negative microbiologic controls of the same sample site, or were lost for follow-up due to dismissal. None of the patients had signs or symptoms indicative for infection. They were treated in various departments and clinics, including orthopedics, pediatrics, intensive care, gynecology, ENT, urology, and internal medicine. A large spectrum of age, clinical specimen, and underlying disease was observed. Molecular fingerprinting of the isolates using arbitrarily primed PCR revealed identical band patterns, and the additional typing of select isolates at the National Reference Center confirmed species ID, antimicrobial resistance, and presence of a metallobetalactamase of GIM-1 genotype. Patients were isolated, and infection control measures were reinforced according to standard principles for carbapenemase producing gramnegative bacilli. Extended epidemiologic workup, however, did not reveal any factors for transmission, previous hospitalizations, nor common places of residence. Extensive analysis of specimen workup in the microbiologic laboratory rendered a laboratory associated pseudooutbreak highly unlikely. The University of Saarland Medical Center provides of one of the largest subterranean PTS systems in Europe linking all clinical buildings in a tube system of approximately 15 km in length, and providing {\textgreater}300.000 specimen transports to the various laboratories in addition to numerous nonlaboratory transports. Extensive environmental investigations revealed positive results for Acinetobacter spp (GIM-1) of identical AP-PCR type on 8/13 patient data sheets which accompanied the initial positive specimen, as well as PTS cartridges prospectively analyzed. Positive microbiological results were associated with humidity in the cartridges whose origin appears to be the result of extensive condensation of warm ambient pressure air in the PTS tubes, and water collection in lower tube segments. Fluid contamination of cartridges and specimen containers appears a plausible explanation for specimen positivity as well as for the periodicity of the pseudooutbreak manifestations. Upon identification of the cause for this large pseudooutbreak, all clinical infection control measures were lifted, yet, rigorous measures for hygienic handling of PTS stations, cartridges, and transported specimens were introduced. Currently, extensive measures are underway to decontaminate the PTS. In conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the worldwide first description of a large-scale contamination of a-hospital PTS. In absence of established environmental hygiene standards, bacterial contamination of PTS may occur for extended time periods prior to recognition, and may be the cause not only for pseudooutbreaks but also for transmission of nosocomial pathogens with yet unknown consequences. This experience suggests that establishment of standards is necessary for the particular challenge which PTS may represent for hospital hygiene.",B GÃ¤rtner and A Dawson and S Gatermann and A Halfmann and M Kaase and M Klotz and P LÃ¼ttchens and C Petit and R Veith and L {Von MÃ¼ller} and M Herrmann,1438-4221,International Journal of Medical Microbiology,"Acinetobacter,Acinetobacter baumannii,Bacilli,Europe,antibiotic resistance,bacterium contamination,carbapenem derivative,carbapenemase,contamination,environmental sanitation,follow up,genotype,gynecology,hospital,hospital hygiene,hospital patient,hospitalization,human,humidity,hygiene,infection,infection control,intensive care,internal medicine,laboratory,liquid,mass spectrometry,microbiology,newborn,orthopedics,otorhinolaryngology,outpatient,pathogenesis,patient,patient coding,pediatrics,periodicity,species,tube,university,university hospital,urology,water",119,{A pseudooutbreak due to Acinetobacter spp. (GIM-1) contamination of a pneumatic transport system (PTS) of a large university hospital},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l70938258 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmm.2012.08.002 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=14384221{\&}id=doi:10.1016{\%}2fj.ijmm.2012.08.002{\&}atitle=a+pseudooutbr,302,2012,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,maybe,brooke,maybe,mushtaq,mushtaq,zach,yes,zm_5.csv,NA,NA,zm_5_2.mex,yes,journal

The outbreak also highlighted the importance of efforts to strengthen food safety policies related to Salmonella in chicken parts and has implications for future changes within the poultry industry. Objective: To investigate a largemultistate outbreak of multidrug resistant Salmonella Heidelberg infections. Design: Epidemiologic and laboratory investigations of patients infected with the outbreak strains of Salmonella Heidelberg and traceback of possible food exposures. Setting: United States. Outbreak period was March 1, 2013 through July 11, 2014 Patients: A case was defined as illness in a person infected with a laboratory-confirmedSalmonella Heidelberg with 1 of 7 outbreak pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) XbaI patterns with illness onset from March 1, 2013 through July 11, 2014. A total of 634 case-patientswere identified through passive surveillance; 200/528 (38{\%}) were hospitalized, none died. Results: Interviewswere conducted with 435 case-patients: 371 (85{\%}) reported eating any chicken in the 7 days before becoming ill. Of 273 case-patients interviewed with a focused questionnaire, 201 (74{\%}) reported eating chicken prepared at home. Among case-patients with available brand information, 152 (87{\%}) of 175 patients reported consuming Company A brand chicken. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was completed on 69 clinical isolates collected from case-patients; 67{\%} were drug resistant, including 24 isolates (35{\%}) that were multidrug resistant. The source of Company A brand chicken consumed by case-patients was traced back to 3 California production establishments from which 6 of 7 outbreak strains were isolated. Conclusions: Epidemiologic, laboratory, traceback, and environmental investigations conducted by local, state, and federal public health and regulatory officials indicated that consumption of Company A chicken was the cause of this outbreak. The outbreak involved multiple PFGE patterns, a variety of chicken products, and 3 production establishments, suggesting a reservoir for contamination upstream from the production establishments. Sources of bacteria and genes responsible for resistance, such as farms providing birds for slaughter or environmental reservoir on farms that raise chickens, might explain how multiple PFGE patterns were linked to chicken from 3 separate production establishments and many different poultry products.",L Gieraltowski and J Higa and V Peralta and A Green and C Schwensohn and H Rosen and T Libby and B Kissler and N Marsden-Haug and H Booth and A Kimura and J Grass and A Bicknese and B Tolar and S Defibaugh-ChÃ¡vez and I Williams and M Wise and C Braden and A C Brown and L Burnworth and A Crawley and A Douris and S Frink and D Goldman and M Hung-Fan and D Kiang and S Lew and J Nakao and M Needham and R Tauxe and M Wong and L Allen and R Atkinson and C B Behravesh and K Becker and A Blackstock and J Folster and D Gilliss and K Holt and R Leifert and J Lidgard and A Poe and J Pringle and W Probert and M Rickard and K Robertson and E Trees and D Vetter and D Vugia,1932-6203,PLoS ONE,"Salmonella enterica serovar Heidelberg,United States,adolescent,adult,aged,ampicillin,antibiotic resistance,article,bacterial load,bacterial strain,bacterium contamination,bacterium isolate,child,chloramphenicol,controlled study,epidemic,female,gentamicin,human,infant,infection control,kanamycin,major clinical study,male,nonhuman,poultry product,pulsed field gel electrophoresis,questionnaire,salmonellosis,streptomycin,sulfafurazole,tetracycline",NA,{National outbreak of multidrug resistant Salmonella Heidelberg infections linked to a single poultry company},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l612857004 http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0162369 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=19326203{\&}id=doi:10.1371{\%}2fjournal.pone.0162369{\&}atitle=national,11,2016,9,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,maybe,cale,maybe,zach,zach,zach,yes,zm_5.csv,NA,NA,zm_5_2.mex,yes,journal

OBJECTIVE: To describe an outbreak of CRKP in Puerto Rico, determine risk factors for CRKP acquisition, and detail the successful measures taken to control the outbreak. DESIGN: Two case-control studies. SETTING: A 328-bed tertiary care teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Twenty-six CRKP case patients identified during the outbreak period of February through September 2008, 26 randomly selected uninfected control patients, and 26 randomly selected control patients with carbapenem-susceptible K. pneumoniae (CSKP) hospitalized during the same period. METHODS: We performed active case finding, including retrospective review of the hospital's microbiology database and prospective perirectal surveillance culture sampling in high-risk units. Case patients were compared with each control group while controlling for time at risk. We sequenced the bla(KPC) gene with polymerase chain reaction for 7 outbreak isolates and subtyped these isolates with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: In matched, multivariable analysis, the presence of wounds (hazard ratio, 19.0 [95{\%} confidence interval {\{}CI{\}}, 2.5-142.0]) was associated with CRKP compared with no K. pneumoniae. Transfer between units (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 7.5 [95{\%} CI, 1.8-31.1]), surgery (adjusted OR, 4.0 [95{\%} CI, 1.0-15.7]), and wounds (adjusted OR, 4.9 [95{\%} CI, 1.1-21.8]) were independent risk factors for CRKP compared to CSKP. A novel K. pneumoniae carbapenemase variant (KPC-8) was present in 5 isolates. Implementation of active surveillance for CRKP colonization and cohorting of CRKP patients rapidly controlled the outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced surveillance for CRKP colonization and intensified infection control measures that include limiting the physical distribution of patients can reduce CRKP transmission during an outbreak.",C J Gregory and E Llata and N Stine and C Gould and L M Santiago and G J Vazquez and I E Robledo and A Srinivasan and R V Goering and K M Tomashek,0899-823x,Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology,",*Disease Outbreaks,*Genetic Variation,80 and over,Aged,Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology,Bacterial Proteins/*genetics/metabolism,Bacterial/*genetics,Carbapenems/pharmacology,Case-Control Studies,Drug Resistance,Female,Hospitals,Humans,Klebsiella Infections/*epidemiology/microbiology/p,Klebsiella pneumoniae infection,Klebsiella pneumoniae/drug effects/*enzymology/gen,Male,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Middle Aged,Puerto Rico,Puerto Rico/epidemiology,Risk Factors,Teaching,adult,aged,antibiotic resistance,article,bacterial colonization,beta-Lactamases/*genetics/metabolism,carbapenem,clinical article,controlled study,disease surveillance,epidemic,female,gene sequence,human,infection control,male,risk factor",476--484,{Outbreak of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae in Puerto Rico associated with a novel carbapenemase variant},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l358653331 http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/651670 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=0899823x{\&}id=doi:10.1086{\%}2f651670{\&}atitle=outbreak+of+carbapenem-resistant+kle,31,2010,5,"from duplicate 1 (outbreak of carbapenem-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae in puerto rico associated with a novel carbapenemase variant - gregory, c j; llata, e; stine, n; gould, c; santiago, l m; vazquez, g j; robledo, i e; srinivasan, a; goering, r v; tomashek, k m)

Methods: Three ESC resistant N. gonorrhoeae isolates were cultured from the urethral discharge of three men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM), two residing in Johannesburg and one in Cape Town. One of the MSM reported a persistent urethral discharge which had failed to respond to previous therapy with oral cefixime. Agar dilution minimum inhibitory concentration assays were performed for eight antibiotics. The Johannesburg patients' isolates were further characterised by identification of key $\beta$-lactam-associated resistance mutations in penA, mtrR and its promoter, porB1b, ponA, and pilQ through PCR-based amplification and DNA sequencing. For molecular epidemiological characterisation, all three isolates were typed by N. gonorrhoeae multi-antigen sequencing typing (NG-MAST); additionally, full-length porB gene sequencing and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) were performed for the Johannesburg isolates. Results: All three isolates were resistant to cefixime, ciprofloxacin, penicillin and tetracycline, intermediate/resistant to azithromycin but susceptible to ceftriaxone and gentamicin. The Johannesburg isolates had the type XXXIV penAmosaic allele in addition to previously described resistance mutations in the mtrR promoter (A deletion), porB1b (penB) (G101K, A102N) and ponA1 (L421P). All three isolates had an identical N. gonorrhoeae multi-antigen sequence type (ST4822). The two Johannesburg isolates had an identical multi-locus sequence type (ST1901). Conclusions All three strains were resistant to cefixime and were epidemiologically linked with identical NG-MAST sequence types. The Johannesburg isolates possessed a number of key $\beta$-lactam-associated resistance mutations and the type XXXIV penAmosaic allele.

However, the eradication efficacy has substantially declined recent decade. In Russia, josamycin (another macrolide) is the recommended first-line treatment for M. genitalium infections, however, no data regarding treatment efficacy with josamycin and resistance in M. genitalium infections have been internationally published. We examined the M. genitalium prevalence in males attending an STI clinic in Moscow, Russia from December 2006 to January 2008, investigated treatment efficacy with josamycin in male urethritis, and monitored the M. genitalium DNA eradication dynamics and selection of macrolide resistance in M. genitalium during this treatment. METHODS: Microscopy and real-time PCRs were used to diagnose urethritis and non-viral STIs, respectively, in males (n = 320). M. genitalium positive patients were treated with recommended josamycin regimen and treatment efficacy was monitored using quantitative real-time PCR. Macrolide resistance mutations were identified using sequencing of the 23S rRNA gene. RESULTS: Forty-seven (14.7{\%}) males were positive for M. genitalium only and most (85.1{\%}) of these had symptoms and signs of urethritis. Forty-six (97.9{\%}) males agreed to participate in the treatment efficacy monitoring. All the pre-treatment M. genitalium specimens had wild-type 23S rRNA. The elimination of M. genitalium DNA was substantially faster in patients with lower pre-treatment M. genitalium load, and the total eradication rate was 43/46 (93.5{\%}). Of the six patients with high pre-treatment M. genitalium load, three (50{\%}) remained positive post-treatment and these positive specimens contained macrolide resistance mutations in the 23S rRNA gene, i.e., A2059G (n = 2) and A2062G (n = 1). CONCLUSIONS: M. genitalium was a frequent cause of male urethritis in Moscow, Russia. The pre-treatment M. genitalium load might be an effective predictor of eradication efficacy with macrolides (and possibly additional antimicrobials) and selection of macrolide resistance. Additional in vivo and in vitro data are crucial to support the recommendation of using josamycin as first-line treatment for M. genitalium infections in Russia. It would be valuable to develop international M. genitalium management guidelines, and quantitative diagnostic PCRs determining also M. genitalium load and resistance mutations (for macrolides and ideally also moxifloxacin) should ideally be recommended.",A Guschin and P Ryzhikh and T Rumyantseva and M Gomberg and M Unemo,1471-2334,BMC Infectious Diseases,",*Bacterial Load/drug effects/genetics,Adolescent,Adult,Aged,AmpliSens,Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology,Bacterial/*drug effects,Bacterial/analysis/genetics,Chlamydia trachomatis,DNA,Drug Resistance,Herpes simplex virus 2,Humans,Josamycin/pharmacology/*therapeutic use,Macrolides/*pharmacology/therapeutic use,Male,Middle Aged,Mycoplasma Infections/*drug therapy/epidemiology/m,Mycoplasma genitalium,Mycoplasma genitalium/drug effects/genetics/*isola,Neisseria gonorrhoeae,Polymerase Chain Reaction,Prevalence,RNA 23S,RNA sequence,Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction,Russia/epidemiology,Russian Federation,Treatment Failure,Treatment Outcome,Trichomonas vaginalis,Urethritis/*drug therapy/epidemiology/microbiology,Young Adult,adult,aged,antibiotic resistance,article,azithromycin,bacterial DNA,bacterial clearance,bacterial load,bacterium detection,clinical feature,drug efficacy,drug monitoring,drug treatment failure,gene mutation,human,josamycin,macrolide,major clinical study,male,microscopy,micturition,minimum inhibitory concentration,moxifloxacin,mutational analysis,nonhuman,patient compliance,polymerase chain reaction system,prevalence,pristinamycin,quantitative analysis,real time polymerase chain reaction,sexually transmitted disease,treatment duration,urethritis",40,"{Treatment efficacy, treatment failures and selection of macrolide resistance in patients with high load of Mycoplasma genitalium during treatment of male urethritis with josamycin}",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l602614386 http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12879-015-0781-7 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=14712334{\&}id=doi:10.1186{\%}2fs12879-015-0781-7{\&}atitle=treatment+effi,15,2015,1,"from duplicate 1 (treatment efficacy, treatment failures and selection of macrolide resistance in patients with high load of mycoplasma genitalium during treatment of male urethritis with josamycin - guschin, a; ryzhikh, p; rumyantseva, t; gomberg, m; unemo, m)

8616,yes,higgins2010,article,"The mechanism of stepwise acquired multidrug resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii isolates from a hospitalized patient was investigated. Thirteen consecutive multidrug-resistant isolates were recovered from the same patient over a 2-month period. The Vitek 2 system identified the isolates as meropenem-sensitive Acinetobacter lwoffii; however, molecular identification showed that the isolates were A. baumannii. Etest revealed that the isolates were meropenem resistant. The presence of oxacillinase (OXA)-type enzymes were investigated by sequencing. The clonal relatedness of isolates was assessed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Expression of the genes encoding the efflux pumps AdeB and AdeJ was performed by semiquantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR). The adeRS two-component system was sequenced. All isolates had identical PFGE fingerprints, suggesting clonal identity. The first six isolates were positive for the novel blaOXA-164 gene. The following seven isolates, recovered after treatment with a combination of meropenem, amikacin, ciprofloxacin, and co-trimoxazole showed an increase of {\textgreater}7-fold in adeB mRNA transcripts and a missense mutation in bla OXA-164, converting it to blaOXA-58. Sequencing revealed a novel mutation in adeR. These data illustrate how A. baumannii can adapt during antimicrobial therapy, leading to increased antimicrobial resistance.

8862,maybe,hopkins2007a,article,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of qnr genes in selected Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli isolated in the UK. METHODS: One hundred and eighteen S. enterica and 103 E. coli were screened for qnrA, qnrB and qnrS by PCR. Transferability of qnr plasmids was assessed and isolated plasmids compared with previously identified qnr plasmids by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and hybridization experiments. PCRs and sequencing identified co-transferred beta-lactamase genes and mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining region of gyrA. RESULTS: Only six S. enterica strains belonging to four serotypes (Stanley, Typhimurium, Virchow and Virginia) were positive for qnrS1. qnrS1 was present on plasmids of 13.5 kb (TPqnrS-1a and -1b) in Typhimurium and Virginia isolates, 44 kb (TPqnrS-2) in two Virchow isolates and {\textgreater}148 kb (TPqnrS-3a and -3b) in two Stanley isolates. bla(TEM-1) and a group 9 bla(CTX-M) were co-transferred on TPqnrS-2 and TPqnrS-3b. Hybridization of a qnrS1 probe to digested qnrS1 plasmids suggested qnrS1 on TPqnrS-2 may be located in a similar genetic environment to Shigella qnrS plasmid pAH0376, but in a different environment in the other plasmids. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance in a Salmonella isolate from the UK; five isolates were associated with foreign travel to, or food imported from, the Far East. The presence of qnrS1 on different plasmid backbones in several Salmonella serotypes suggests successful dissemination of plasmids or qnrS1. It is of concern that qnrS1 is being identified in Salmonella serotypes that are commonly implicated in human infection in the UK.

8916,yes,hottes2013,article,"BACKGROUND: Widespread resistance of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to penicillin, tetracycline, and fluoroquinolones has challenged effective treatment and control; recent international case reports of cefixime, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin resistance suggest that the remaining treatment options are now additionally threatened. To explore trends in antimicrobial susceptibility of N. gonorrhoeae, we reviewed provincial laboratory data from British Columbia, 2006 to 2011. METHODS: Susceptibility testing was performed for all N. gonorrhoeae isolates detected in-house or forwarded to the reference laboratory. Resistance or intermediate resistance (nonsusceptibility) was defined by standard breakpoints for penicillin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, and spectinomycin. Elevated minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) at serial dilutions of 0.064 $\mu$g/mL or greater were explored for cefixime/ceftriaxone and 0.5 $\mu$g/mL or greater for azithromycin. Nonsusceptibility/elevated MIC was compared by year, site of infection, sex, and age. RESULTS: A total of 1837 isolates representing 22{\%} of all reported gonorrhea cases were analyzed. Nonsusceptibility to penicillin was established at baseline. Nonsusceptibility to tetracycline and ciprofloxacin increased over the study period, reaching 96{\%} and 36{\%}, respectively, in 2011. Sixteen isolates (1{\%}) had a cefixime MIC of 0.25 $\mu$g/mL (none â¥0.5), none had a ceftriaxone MIC of 0.25 $\mu$g/mL or greater, and 15 (1{\%}) had an azithromycin MIC of 2.0 $\mu$g/mL or greater. Elevated MIC of these agents showed an increasing trend over time. Nonsusceptibility and elevated MIC were consistently highest at the rectal and pharyngeal sites and higher in isolates from males, including when stratified to the pharyngeal site. INTERPRETATION: Increases in elevated MIC of cefixime/ceftriaxone/azithromycin were superimposed on a background of established resistance to penicillin, tetracycline, and ciprofloxacin and may signal impending gonococcal resistance to first-line treatments. Ongoing surveillance will inform timely shifts in treatment recommendations.

10221,maybe,kassis-chikhani2006,article,"OBJECTIVES: We studied eight imipenem-resistant isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae involved in an outbreak in a French teaching hospital. METHODS: The eight isolates were recovered from clinical specimens or rectal swabs. Antibiotic susceptibilities were determined using standard agar diffusion and dilution methods including synergy tests. PFGE was used to study the relatedness of isolates. Genes encoding beta-lactamases were characterized by transfer assays, specific amplification and cloning. RESULTS: The eight isolates were closely related by PFGE analysis and highly related to a K. pneumoniae strain from Greece. They were highly resistant to beta-lactams, including aztreonam and imipenem (MIC {\textgreater} or =32 mg/L), and were positive by the imipenem-EDTA disc synergy test. Isolates were also resistant to aminoglycosides, newer quinolones and sulfamethoxazole, and showed an intermediate level of resistance to tetracycline. VIM-1 and SHV-5 beta-lactamases were revealed in all isolates by PCR. The analysis of plasmid contents of Escherichia coli DH10B electroporants expressing the VIM-1 beta-lactamase or the SHV-5 beta-lactamase confirmed that the two enzymes were coded by two different plasmids. The bla(VIM-1) gene was part of a class 1 integron that also included aac6, dhfrI and aadA genes and was similar to those reported from strains isolated in Greece.

10648,maybe,kim2013h,article,"INTRODUCTION: The standard triple therapy which was combined with proton pump inhibitor (PPI), amoxicillin and clarithromycin was widely used for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection in Korea. However, the recent trend of the eradication rates in H. pylori using first-line triple therapy has been infrequently reported. AIMS{\&}METHODS: The aims of this study were to evaluate the trend of the H. pylori eradication rates in single center during recent six years and to identify the risk factors relating the failure of eradication therapy. From January 2007 to December 2012, H. pylori eradication rates in 1168 patients who diagnosed with H. pylori infection and received 7 days triple therapy were investigated according to years, demographic and clinical factors retrospectively. H. pylori eradication was confirmed by 13C-urea breath test, rapid urease test or histopathological examination at least 4 weeks after the completion of triple therapy. RESULTS: The overall H. pylori eradication rate was 84.5{\%}. The annual eradication rates from the year 2007 to 2012 were 91.9{\%}, 89.1{\%}, 85.5{\%}, 84.3{\%}, 84.5{\%} and 79.0{\%} consecutively by per-protocol analysis. The eradication rate in first-line triple therapy was decreased during the recent six years (p = 0.024). Multivariate analysis showed that female (OR 1.55; 95{\%} CI 1.02-2.36) and smoking (OR 1.60; 95{\%} CI 1.03-2.48) were associated with the failure of H. pylori eradication therapy. CONCLUSION: The effect of first-line triple therapy for H. pylori infection has decreased during recent six years, which suggests that the antibiotic resistant H. pylori has increased against the therapy based on the combination of PPI, amoxicillin and clarithromycin. Therefore, other variable first-line therapies might be considered for H. pylori eradication in the near future.",S E Kim and M I Park and S J Park and W Moon and Y J Choi and J H Cheon and H J Kwon and K H Ku and C H Yoo,2050-6406,United European Gastroenterology Journal,"European,Helicobacter infection,Helicobacter pylori,Korea,amoxicillin,antibiotic agent,clarithromycin,eradication therapy,examination,female,gastroenterology,human,infection,multivariate analysis,patient,proton pump inhibitor,pylorus,rapid urease test,risk factor,smoking,therapy,urea breath test,urea c 13",a424,{The trend of eradication rate of first-line the trend in the eradication rates of first-line therapy for helicobacter pylori infection and risk factors of eradication therapy},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l72264259 http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2050640613502900 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=20506406{\&}id=doi:10.1177{\%}2f2050640613502900{\&}atitle=the+trend+of+erad,1,2013,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,maybe,erica,maybe,mushtaq,mushtaq,zach,no,zm_5.csv,could not get full-text in english,NA,NA,no,journal

Because of the difficulty in accurate species identification of C. gilardii, there are few case reports of infection caused by this organism. In previous reports, C. gilardii has been characterized as an organism with low pathogenicity that causes opportunistic infections. Case presentation: We encountered a case of pacemaker-associated bloodstream infection caused by C. gilardii in a 90-year old woman without obvious immunodeficiency. We identified the isolates as C. gilardii by sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The patient was treated with removal of the lead and administration of antimicrobial agents. Because of the acquisition of antibiotic resistance during antibiotic treatment, the antimicrobial agent was changed during the course of treatment. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first report of an infection caused by this organism in a patient without obvious immunodeficiency. Although the true pathogenicity of C. gilardii is unclear, the possibility that it exerts pathogenicity not only in persons with immunodeficiency but also in immunocompetent persons is suggested.",T Kobayashi and I Nakamura and H Fujita and A Tsukimori and A Sato and S Fukushima and K Ohkusu and T Matsumoto,1471-2334,BMC Infectious Diseases,"Cupriavidus,Cupriavidus gilardii,Gram negative infection,RNA 16S,RNA gene,add on therapy,aged,amikacin,antibiotic resistance,antibiotic therapy,antiinfective agent,article,aztreonam,bacterial virulence,bacterium identification,bacterium isolate,bloodstream infection,case report,cefepime,ceftazidime,cilastatin plus imipenem,ciprofloxacin,cotrimoxazole,device infection,drug substitution,female,gene sequence,gentamicin,human,immunocompetence,implanted heart pacemaker,levofloxacin,meropenem,minocycline,piperacillin,piperacillin plus tazobactam,sultamicillin,very elderly,virus gene",NA,{First case report of infection due to Cupriavidus gilardii in a patient without immunodeficiency: A case report},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l612249194 http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12879-016-1838-y http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=14712334{\&}id=doi:10.1186{\%}2fs12879-016-1838-y{\&}atitle=first+case+rep,16,2016,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,no,erica,maybe,mushtaq,ayomide,zach,yes,zm_5.csv,NA,NA,zm_5_2.mex,yes,journal
11163,maybe,kuan2015,article,"The outbreak of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) has become an increasing problem in many TB-burdened countries. The underlying drug resistance mechanisms, including the genetic variation favored by selective pressure in the resistant population, are partially understood. Recently, the first case of XDR-TB was reported in Malaysia. However, the detailed genotype family and mechanisms of the formation of multiple drugs resistance are unknown. We sequenced the whole genome of the UM 1072388579 strain with a 2-kb insert-size library and combined with that from previously sequenced 500-bp-insert paired-end reads to produce an improved sequence with maximal sequencing coverage across the genome. In silico spoligotyping and phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that UM 1072388579 strain belongs to an ancestral-like, non-Beijing clade of East Asia lineage. This is supported by the presence of a number of lineage-specific markers, including fadD28, embA, nuoD and pks7. Polymorphism analysis showed that the drug-susceptibility profile is correlated with the pattern of resistance mutations. Mutations in drug-efflux pumps and the cell wall biogenesis pathway such as mmpL, pks and fadD genes may play an important role in survival and adaptation of this strain to its surrounding environment. In this work, fifty-seven putative promoter SNPs were identified. Among them, we identified a novel SNP located at -4 T allele of TetR/acrR promoter as an informative marker to recognize strains of East Asian lineage. Our work indicates that the UM 1072388579 harbors both classical and uncommon SNPs that allow it to escape from inhibition by many antibiotics.

11179,maybe,kudinha2013,article,"The recent emergence of multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli sequence type 131 (ST131) has coincided with an increase in general antibiotic resistance of E. coli, suggesting that ST131 has a contributing role in resistance. However, there is little information about the contribution of ST131 to different clinical syndromes or the basis for its impressive emergence and epidemic spread. To investigate this, we studied 953 E. coli isolates from women of reproductive age in the central west region of New South Wales, Australia, including 623 urinary isolates from patients with cystitis (cystitis isolates) (n = 322) or pyelonephritis (pyelonephritis isolates) (n = 301) and 330 fecal isolates from healthy controls. The characteristics studied included ST131 clonal group status, resistance to different antibiotics, presence of virulence factor (VF) genes, and biofilm production. As expected, fecal isolates differed significantly from urinary (cystitis and pyelonephritis) isolates in most of the studied characteristics. Antibiotic resistance was significantly more common in ST131 than in non-ST131 isolates. Both antibiotic resistance and ST131 were more common in pyelonephritis than cystitis isolates and least so among fecal isolates. Within each source group, individual VF genes were more prevalent and VF scores were higher for ST131 than for non-ST131 isolates. For ST131 only, the prevalences of most individual VF genes and VF scores were the lowest in the fecal isolates, higher in the cystitis isolates, and highest in the pyelonephritis isolates. Biofilm production was strongly associated with ST131 status and antibiotic resistance. These results clarify the distribution of the ST131 clonal group and its epidemiological associations in our region and suggest that it exhibits both enhanced virulence and increased antibiotic resistance compared with those of other urinary tract infection (UTI) and fecal E. coli isolates from women of reproductive age.",T Kudinha and J R Johnson and S D Andrew and F Kong and P Anderson and G L Gilbert,0095-1137,J Clin Microbiol,"*Drug Resistance, Bacterial,Adolescent,Adult,Biofilms/growth {\&} development,Escherichia coli Infections/epidemiology/*microbio,Escherichia coli/classification/*drug effects/gene,Female,Genotype,Humans,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Middle Aged,Molecular Epidemiology,Molecular Typing,New South Wales/epidemiology,Prevalence,Prospective Studies,Urinary Tract Infections/*microbiology,Virulence Factors/genetics,Young Adult",3270--3276,{Escherichia coli sequence type 131 as a prominent cause of antibiotic resistance among urinary Escherichia coli isolates from reproductive-age women},NA,51,2013,10,"1098-660x

11465,yes,lambiase2006,article,"BACKGROUND: Recent reports document an increasing incidence of new Gram-negative pathogens such as Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Alcaligenes xylosoxidans isolated from patients with Cystic Fibrosis, along with an increase in common Gram-negative pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia complex. Furthermore, the increase in multidrug-resistance of such organisms makes the therapeutic management of these patients more problematic. Therefore, careful isolation and identification, and accurate studies of susceptibility to antibiotics are critical for predicting the spread of strains, improving therapeutic measures and facilitating our understanding of the epidemiology of emerging pathogens. The first aim of this study was to determine the incidence and the prevalence of colonization by Gram-negative organisms isolated from respiratory samples of Cystic Fibrosis patients in the Regional Referral Cystic Fibrosis Centre of Naples; the second was to evaluate the spectrum of multidrug-resistance of these organisms. METHODS: Patients (n = 300) attending the Regional Cystic Fibrosis Unit were enrolled in this study over 3 years. Sputum was processed for microscopic tests and culture. An automated system, Phoenix (Becton Dickinson, Sparks, Maryland, USA), was used for phenotypic identification of all strains; the API 20 NE identification system (bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) was used when the identification with the Phoenix system was inaccurate. A PCR-RFLP method was used to characterize the organisms in the Burkholderia cepacia complex. A chemosusceptibility test on microbroth dilutions (Phoenix) was used. Primary outcomes such as FEV1 were correlate with different pathogens. RESULTS: During the period of study, 40{\%} of patients was infected by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 7{\%} by Burkholderia cepacia complex, 11{\%} by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and 7{\%} by Alcaligenes xylosoxidans. Of the strains isolated, 460 were multidrug-resistant. Multiresistant were Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia complex. CONCLUSION: The results confirm previously reported data; in particular, they show an increase the isolation of non-fermentative Gram-negative bacteria in Cystic Fibrosis patients. They also demonstrate increased resistance to antibiotics. Beta-lactams are rarely effective, with exception of ceftazidime, which is the most efficacious agent against multiresistant strains. Aminoglycosides and quinolones are poorly efficacious.",A Lambiase and V Raia and M {Del Pezzo} and A Sepe and V Carnovale and F Rossano,1471-2334,BMC Infect Dis,"Adolescent,Adult,Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology,Child,Child, Preschool,Cohort Studies,Cystic Fibrosis/*complications/*microbiology,Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial,Female,Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections/*complications/,Humans,Infant,Male,Middle Aged",4,{Microbiology of airway disease in a cohort of patients with cystic fibrosis},NA,6,2006,NA,"1471-2334

12446,yes,logan2016a,article,"Metallo-$\beta$-lactamases (MBLs) are emerging as the most notable resistance determinants in Enterobacteriaceae. In many cases, the genes encoding MBLs are part of complex, mobile genetic elements that carry other resistance determinants. In the United States, there are increasing reports of MBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, with New Delhi MBLs (NDMs) accounting for the majority of transmissible MBL infections. Many infections caused by NDM-producing bacteria are associated with international travel and medical tourism. However, little recognition of the introduction of MBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae into the pediatric community has followed. Reports suggest that this occurred as early as 2002. Here, we reflect on the unwelcome emergence of MBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in US children and the available clinical and molecular data associated with spread. Since 2002, there have been disturbing reports that include the most readily transmissible MBLs, blaIMP, blaVIM, and blaNDM types.

We isolated a ceftaroline-resistant (MIC {\textgreater} 32 mg/liter) MRSA strain from the blood of a cystic fibrosis patient and five MRSA strains from the respiratory tract of this patient. Whole-genome sequencing identified two amino acid-altering mutations uniquely present in the ceftaroline-binding pocket of the transpeptidase region of penicillin-binding protein 2a (PBP2a) in ceftaroline-resistant isolates.

A 12-month-old child was admitted for a 20-day episode of loose stools, non-fetid, with mucus and blood. The stool sample showed the presence of blood and mucus and S. flexneri which was resistant to Ampicillin, Nalidixic acid, Ciprofloxacin, Furoxone, Ceftriaxone and sensitive only to Cefoperazone and sulbactam combination. The child was promptly admitted and treated with a combination of Cefoperazone and sulbactam. The use of this combination was met with success in the present case, and may be considered as a temporary answer to the emerging cephalosporin-resistance. {\textcopyright} The Author [2009].

We describe a cluster of colistin-resistant, carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae infection cases involving three institutions in Detroit, MI. A cluster of five cases of colistin-resistant, carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae was identified at Detroit Medical Center (DMC) from 27 July to 22 August 2009. Epidemiologic data were collected, and transmission opportunities were analyzed. Isolates were genotyped by using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and repetitive extragenic palindromic PCR. Data regarding the use of colistin were obtained from pharmacy records. The index case of colistin-resistant, carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae was followed 20 days later by four additional cases occurring in a 6-day interval. All of the patients, at some point, had stayed at one particular institution. The mean number of opportunities for transmission between patients was 2.3 +/- 0.5, and each patient had at least one opportunity for transmission with one of the other patients. Compared to 60 colistin-susceptible, carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae controls isolated in the previous year at DMC, case patients were significantly older (P = 0.05) and the carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae organisms isolated from them displayed much higher MICs to imipenem (P {\textless} 0.001). Colistin use was not enhanced in the months preceding the outbreak. Genotyping revealed two closely related clones. This report of a colistin-resistant, carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae outbreak is strongly linked to patient-to-patient transmission.

The objective of our investigation was to determine risk factors for colonization with MRSA as well as staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) genotypes among pediatric health care workers from a public hospital in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. We collected nasal swabs and data on potential risk factors from 178 health care workers from all pediatric sectors from January to December 2012. Swab cultures were evaluated for antimicrobial resistance against Cefoxitin and Oxacillin, and resistance was confirmed by identifying the mecA gene by PCR. MRSA colonization was 5.1{\%} (n=9/178). Logistic regression analysis showed being a nurse and working in an inpatient unit as potential risk factors for MRSA colonization (adjusted OR= 11.6, 95{\%} CI 1.2 - 110.7 and 2.7, 95{\%} CI 0.3 - 23.7, respectively). No non-work related risk factors were identified. Four of the nine isolates were found to be SCCmec type IV, the genotype most commonly associated with community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA). Five isolates were observed to be SCCmec type III, with four collected from nurses of various pediatric sectors in August/September alone. We then compared these isolates with nasal MRSA isolates sampled from children within 48 hours of being admitted to the pediatric ward from December 2011 to July 2012. Of 11 CA-MRSA isolates from 92 children sampled (12.0{\%}), ten were found to be SCCmec IV, including two which preceded those collected from nurses in the same sector. Given SCCmec type III isolates appear to have circulated among various pediatric sectors, the introduction of the more virulent CA-MRSA genotype to the pediatric inpatient ward is of high concern.

Both isolates showed susceptibility patterns suggestive of harbouring a plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase (pACBL) and a plasmid-encoded quinolone resistance (PMQR). PCR-based replicon, MOB typing, plasmid profile and Southern hybridization analyses revealed that both isolates coharboured bla(DHA-1) and qnrB genes on the same IncL/M-MOB(P13) plasmid approximately 70 kb in size. Together with the fact that both plasmids were conjugative in the laboratory, these results strongly suggest that a horizontal transfer event could take place in vivo. This is the first report of an isolate of S. marcescens harbouring a pACBL. The only phenotypic method that suggests the presence of a pACBL in an isolate harbouring an inducible chromosomal AmpC enzyme is the observation of scattered colonies near the edge of the inhibition zones of some beta-lactams.

13552,yes,mcdougal2010,article,"USA300 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates are usually resistant only to oxacillin, erythromycin, and, increasingly, levofloxacin. Of these, oxacillin and levofloxacin resistances are chromosomally encoded. Plasmid-mediated clindamycin, mupirocin, and/or tetracycline resistance has been observed among USA300 isolates, but these descriptions were limited to specific patient populations or isolated occurrences. We examined the antimicrobial susceptibilities of invasive MRSA isolates from a national surveillance population in order to identify USA300 isolates with unusual, possibly emerging, plasmid-mediated antimicrobial resistance. DNA from these isolates was assayed for the presence of resistance determinants and the presence of a pSK41-like conjugative plasmid. Of 823 USA300 isolates, 72 (9{\%}) were tetracycline resistant; 69 of these were doxycycline susceptible and tetK positive, and 3 were doxycycline resistant and tetM positive. Fifty-one (6.2{\%}) isolates were clindamycin resistant and ermC positive; 22 (2.7{\%}) isolates were high-level mupirocin resistant (mupA positive); 5 (0.6{\%}) isolates were trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) resistant, of which 4 were dfrA positive; and 7 (0.9{\%}) isolates were gentamicin resistant and aac6â²-aph2â³ positive. Isolates with pSK41-like plasmids (n = 24) were positive for mupA (n = 19), dfrA (n = 6), aac6â²-aph2â³ (n = 6), tetM (n = 2), and ermC (n = 8); 20 pSK41-positive isolates were positive for two or more resistance genes. Conjugative transfer of resistance was demonstrated between four gentamicin- and mupirocin-resistant and three gentamicin- and TMP-SMZ-resistant USA300 isolates; transconjugants harbored a single pSK41-like plasmid, which was PCR positive for aac6â²-aph2â³ and either mupA and/or dfrA. USA300 and USA100 isolates from the same state with identical resistance profiles contained pSK41-like plasmids with indistinguishable restriction and Southern blot profiles, suggesting horizontal plasmid transfer between USA100 and USA300 isolates.

14105,yes,miyamoto2013a,article,"Purpose: We report a case of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) keratitis after Descemet's stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK). Case Report: An 87-year-old woman who had undergone a DSAEK 4 months previously was referred to Tokushima University Hospital with a diagnosis of infectious keratitis after DSAEK. A white abscess and infiltration in the inferior cornea of the right eye were observed. We started an empiric therapy using topical levofloxacin and chloramphenicol on the basis of the microscopic findings of the corneal scraping concurrently with cultivation of the cornea. Results: A strain of MRSA was isolated from the corneal sample. Although the strain was susceptible to chloramphenicol, it was resistant to quinolone. The keratitis improved rapidly due to empiric therapy, and topical steroids could be resumed 6 days after initiation of the empiric therapy. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first case of MRSA keratitis, and the second case of bacterial keratitis, after DSAEK. MRSA keratitis can occur following uneventful DSAEK. The empiric therapy on the basis of results from a light microscopic examination of a Gram-stained corneal scraping and restarting topical steroids in the early stages of medication contributed to the good clinical course of this case. {\textcopyright} 2013 S.

15431,maybe,oikonomou2015,article,"BACKGROUND: Colistin-resistant/carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii is a significant challenge for antibiotic treatment and infection control policies. Since 2012, in Central Greece an increase of colistin/pan- resistant A. baumannii has occurred, indicating the need for further analysis. METHODS: A total of 86 colistin-resistant/carbapenem-resistant out of 1228 A. baumannii clinical isolates, consecutively collected between 2012 and 2014 in a tertiary Greek hospital of Central Greece, as well as one environmental isolate from surveillance cultures were studied. Molecular typing and mechanisms of resistance to colistin and to carbapenems were assessed, whereas, epidemiological and clinical data of the patients were reviewed. RESULTS: During the study period, the rate of colistin resistance gradually increased and reached 21.1 {\%} in 2014. All colistin-resistant/carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii belonged to 3LST ST101 clone that corresponds to the international clonal lineage II. Carbapenem resistance was associated with the presence of bla oxa-23-like, while resistance to colistin probably correlated with G54E and R109H amino acid substitutions in PmrA and PmrC, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Epidemiological data of the patients indicated that the first detection of colistin-resistant/carbapenem-resistant ST101 clone in the University Hospital of Larissa (UHL) was associated with a patient who previously had received colistin, while, the movement of the infected patients into the hospital probably resulted to its spread.",O Oikonomou and S Sarrou and C C Papagiannitsis and S Georgiadou and K Mantzarlis and E Zakynthinos and G N Dalekos and E Petinaki,1471-2334,BMC Infectious Diseases,",Acinetobacter Infections/epidemiology/microbiology,Acinetobacter baumannii,Acinetobacter baumannii/*drug effects/isolation {\&},Acinetobacter infection,Aged,Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology,Bacterial/drug effects,Carbapenems/*pharmacology,Colistin/*pharmacology,DNA extraction,Drug Resistance,Electrophoresis,Female,Gel,Greece,Greece/epidemiology,Hospitals,Humans,IpxA gene,IpxD gene,Male,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Middle Aged,Molecular Typing,Multiple,Pulsed-Field,aged,amino acid substitution,aminoglycoside antibiotic agent,antibiotic resistance,antibiotic sensitivity,article,bacterial gene,bacterial protein,bacterial strain,bacterium identification,bacterium isolate,blood culture,bloodstream infection,brain ventriculitis,carbapenem,chronic kidney failure,chronic liver disease,chronic lung disease,colistin,comorbidity,controlled study,daptomycin,diabetes mellitus,disease surveillance,epidemic,female,fever,fosfomycin,gene mutation,heart disease,human,major clinical study,male,minimum inhibitory concentration,molecular typing,neurologic disease,pmrCAB gene,pneumonia,polymerase chain reaction,prevalence,protein PmrA,protein PmrC,pyelonephritis,quinoline derived antiinfective agent,tigecycline,unclassified drug,ventilator associated pneumonia",559,"{Rapid dissemination of colistin and carbapenem resistant Acinetobacter baumannii in Central Greece: mechanisms of resistance, molecular identification and epidemiological data}",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l607201359 http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12879-015-1297-x http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=14712334{\&}id=doi:10.1186{\%}2fs12879-015-1297-x{\&}atitle=rapid+dissemin,15,2015,1,"from duplicate 2 (rapid dissemination of colistin and carbapenem resistant acinetobacter baumannii in central greece: mechanisms of resistance, molecular identification and epidemiological data - oikonomou, o; sarrou, s; papagiannitsis, c c; georgiadou, s; mantzarlis, k; zakynthinos, e; dalekos, g n; petinaki, e)

15484,yes,oldenburg2013,article,"PURPOSE: To describe temporal trends in Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistance to moxifloxacin in keratitis isolates from South India. METHODS: The Steroids for Corneal Ulcers Trial (SCUT) was a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled trial assessing outcomes in patients with culture positive bacterial corneal ulcers randomized to receive prednisolone phosphate or placebo. All patients received moxifloxacin, and susceptibility to moxifloxacin was measured at baseline using Etest. We investigated trends in moxifloxacin susceptibility of P. aeruginosa during 2007, 2008, and 2009 isolated in SCUT in South India. RESULTS: There were 89 P. aeruginosa isolates during 2007, 2008, and 2009 in SCUT that were eligible for this study. There was an increase in the proportion of resistant isolates from 19{\%} in 2007 to 52{\%} in 2009 (p = 0.02, chi(2) test for trend). Logistic regression showed that there was a 2-fold increase in odds of resistance per 1 year increase during the study period (odds ratio 2.16, 95{\%} confidence interval 1.09-4.26, p = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS: We found a sharp increase in the proportion of isolates that were resistant to moxifloxacin from 2007 to 2009.

This study was designed to determine the prevalence of CTX-M positive ESBL-producing urinary E. coli isolates from HIV patients and to establish the association of multidrug resistance, phylogeny, and virulence profile with CTX-M production. A total of 57 ESBL producers identified among 76 E. coli strains isolated from HIV patients from South India were screened for b l a C T X - M, AmpC production, multidrug resistance, and nine virulence associated genes (VAGs), fimH, pap, afa/dra, sfa/foc, iutA, fyuA, iroN, usp, and kpsMII. The majority (70.2{\%}) of the ESBL producers harbored b l a C T X - M and were AmpC coproducers. Among the CTX-M producers, 47.5{\%} were found to be UPEC, 10{\%} harbored as many as 7 VAGs, and 45{\%} possessed kpsMII. Multidrug resistance (CIPRSXTRGENR) was significantly more common among the CTX-M producers compared to the nonproducers (70{\%} versus 41.2{\%}). However, 71.4{\%} of the multidrug resistant CTX-M producers exhibited susceptibility to nitrofurantoin thereby making it an effective alternative to cephalosporins/fluoroquinolones. The emergence of CTX-M-producing highly virulent, multidrug resistant uropathogenic E. coli is of significant public health concern in countries like India with a high burden of HIV/AIDS.",K Padmavathy and K Padma and S Rajasekaran,"2090-3065

16637,maybe,pisespongsa2012,article,"Background/aims: Spontaneous bacterial infection of ascites was an important cause of hospitalization and death in cirrhotic patients. Recently, changing in types of pathogens and their antibiotic resistance were reported as important emerging problems. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed medical records of patients with spontaneous ascitic fluid infection in Chiang Mai University Hospital from January 2001 to December 2002 and from January 2008 to September 2009. The isolated pathogens and their antibiotic susceptibility were described and compared. Results: There were 49 episodes of spontaneous ascitic fluid infection from January 2001 to December 2002 and 82 episodes from January 2008 to September 2009. The pathogens were identified in 36.7{\%} and 48.8{\%} respectively. When compared, the ratio of gram negative bacilli (GNB) infection in both periods were similar (p = 0.769) but the pathogens in the second period were significantly more diverse than the first period (p = 0.008 for GNB and p = 0.029 for gram positive cocci) (table 1).

Of the 624 clinical isolates, seven CRE isolates were identified by the disk diffusion method, but were negative for MHT. Only one isolate, Klebsiella pneumoniae, was found to carry blaNDM-1, encoding New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1, and the remaining CRE isolates were negative for the carbapenemase genes looked at.

17038,maybe,qin2014,article,"The emergence and spread of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1 (NDM-1)-producing carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) present an urgent threat to human health. In China, the bla(NDM-1 gene has been reported mostly in Acinetobacter spp. but is rarely found in Enterobacteriaceae. Here, we report a high incidence and endemic spread of NDM-1-producing CRE in Henan Province in China. Sixteen (33.3{\%}) of the 48 CRE isolates obtained from patients during June 2011 to July 2012 were positive for bla(NDM-1), and the gene was found to be carried on plasmids of various sizes ( approximately 55 to approximately 360 kb). These plasmids were readily transferrable to recipient Escherichia coli by conjugation, conferred resistance to multiple antibiotics, and belonged to multiple replicon types. The bla(NDM-1)-positive CRE isolates were genetically diverse, and six new multilocus sequence typing (MLST) sequence types were linked to the carriage of NDM-1. Five of the isolates were classified as extensively drug-resistant (XDR) isolates, four of which also carried the fosA3 gene conferring resistance to fosfomycin, an alternative drug for treating infections by CRE. In each bla(NDM-1)-positive CRE isolate, the bla(NDM-1) gene was downstream of an intact ISAba125 element and upstream of the bleMBL gene. Furthermore, gene environment analysis suggested the possible transmission of bla(NDM-1)-containing sequences from Acinetobacter spp. to Klebsiella pneumoniae and Klebsiella oxytoca. These findings reveal the emergence and active transmission of NDM-1-positive CRE in China and underscore the need for heightened measures to control their further spread.",S Qin and Y Fu and Q Zhang and H Qi and J G Wen and H Xu and L Xu and L Zeng and H Tian and L Rong and Y Li and L Shan and H Xu and Y Yu and X Feng and H M Liu,0066-4804,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,"Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology,Carbapenems/pharmacology,China/epidemiology,Conjugation, Genetic,DNA, Bacterial/*genetics,Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial/*genetics,Enterobacteriaceae Infections/drug,Enterobacteriaceae/drug effects/enzymology/*geneti,Epidemiological Monitoring,Fosfomycin/pharmacology,Genotype,Humans,Incidence,Multilocus Sequence Typing,Plasmids/*chemistry/metabolism,beta-Lactamases/*genetics,therapy/*epidemiology/microbiology/transmission",4275--4282,"{High incidence and endemic spread of NDM-1-positive Enterobacteriaceae in Henan Province, China}",NA,58,2014,8,"1098-6596

17087,yes,qureshi2015,article,"BACKGROUND: With an increase in the use of colistin methansulfonate (CMS) to treat carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii infections, colistin resistance is emerging. METHODS: Patients with infection or colonization due to colistin-resistant A. baumannii were identified at a hospital system in Pennsylvania. Clinical data were collected from electronic medical records. Susceptibility testing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) were performed. To investigate the mechanism of colistin resistance, lipid A was subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Twenty patients with colistin-resistant A. baumannii were identified. Ventilator-associated pneumonia was the most common type of infection. Nineteen patients had received intravenous and/or inhaled CMS for treatment of carbapenem-resistant, colistin-susceptible A. baumannii infection prior to identification of colistin-resistant isolates. The 30-day all-cause mortality rate was 30{\%}. The treatment regimen for colistin-resistant A. baumannii infection associated with the lowest mortality rate was a combination of CMS, a carbapenem, and ampicillin-sulbactam. The colistin-susceptible and -resistant isolates from the same patients were highly related by PFGE, but isolates from different patients were not, suggesting evolution of resistance during CMS therapy. By MLST, all isolates belonged to the international clone II, the lineage that is epidemic worldwide. Phosphoethanolamine modification of lipid A was present in all colistin-resistant A. baumannii isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Colistin-resistant A. baumannii occurred almost exclusively among patients who had received CMS for treatment of carbapenem-resistant, colistin-susceptible A. baumannii infection. Lipid A modification by the addition of phosphoethanolamine accounted for colistin resistance. Susceptibility testing for colistin should be considered for A. baumannii identified from CMS-experienced patients.",Z A Qureshi and L E Hittle and J A O'Hara and J I Rivera and A Syed and R K Shields and A W Pasculle and R K Ernst and Y Doi,1058-4838,Clin Infect Dis,"*Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial,Acinetobacter Infections/complications/*drug thera,Acinetobacter baumannii,Acinetobacter baumannii/*drug effects/genetics/*is,Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Ampicillin/therapeutic use,Carbapenems/*pharmacology/therapeutic use,Colistin/*pharmacology/therapeutic use,Electronic Health Records,Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field,Ethanolamines/chemistry,Female,Humans,Lipid A/chemistry,Male,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Middle Aged,Multilocus Sequence Typing,Pneumonia, Ventilator-Associated/drug therapy/micr,Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorpti,Sulbactam/therapeutic use,carbapenem resistance,colistin resistance,lipid A,molecular typing,purification/pathogenicity",1295--1303,{Colistin-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii: beyond carbapenem resistance},NA,60,2015,9,"1537-6591

17299,maybe,rasheed2014,article,"BACKGROUND: Antibiotic resistance in Helicobacter pylori contributes to failure in eradicating the infection and is most often due to point and missense mutations in a few key genes. METHODS: The antibiotic susceptibility profiles of H. pylori isolates from 46 Pakistani patients were determined by Etest. Resistance and pathogenicity genes were amplified, and sequences were analyzed to determine the presence of mutations. RESULTS: A high percentage of isolates (73.9{\%}) were resistant to metronidazole (MTZ), with considerable resistance to clarithromycin (CLR; 47.8{\%}) and amoxicillin (AML; 54.3{\%}) also observed. Relatively few isolates were resistant to tetracycline (TET; 4.3{\%}) or to ciprofloxacin (CIP; 13{\%}). However, most isolates (n = 43) exhibited resistance to one or more antibiotics. MTZ-resistant isolates contained missense mutations in oxygen-independent NADPH nitroreductase (RdxA; 8 mutations found) and NADH flavin oxidoreductase (FrxA; 4 mutations found). In the 23S rRNA gene, responsible for CLR resistance, a new point mutation (A2181G) and 4 previously reported mutations were identified. Pathogenicity genes cagA, dupA, and vacA s1a/m1 were detected frequently in isolates which were also found to be resistant to MTZ, CLR, and AML. A high percentage of CagA and VacA seropositivity was also observed in these patients. Phylogenetic analysis of partial sequences showed uniform distribution of the 3' region of cagA throughout the tree. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified H. pylori isolates in Pakistan which harbor pathogenicity genes and worrying antibiotic resistance profiles as a result of having acquired multiple point and missense mutations.

17828,maybe,romero-gomez2013,article,"We present a case of bacteraemia due to meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) carrying the mecC gene. The susceptibility to meticillin of Staphylococcus aureus was investigated directly from one blood culture bottle using GenomEra MRSA/SA (Abacus Diagnostica Oy) test. This test identified S. aureus but the presence of the mecA gene result was negative, and the isolate was reported as meticillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). Susceptibility studies were done using VITEK 2 AST-P588 susceptibility cards (bioMerieux). The strain was identified as MRSA by the VITEK 2 system, although oxacillin MIC was low (0.5 microg ml(-1)). In view of these results, the isolate was tested for the presence of the mecC gene by a specific PCR and was verified as MRSA carrying mecC. The emergence of this new mecA homologue could have important consequences for the detection of MRSA when routine PCR methods are used as an identification method or provisional detection of MRSA, as in the case reported in this article, because S. aureus carrying the mecC gene will be wrongly diagnosed as meticillin susceptible.

17898,maybe,rotimi2008,article,"Cephalosporins are major antimicrobials used to treat serious Salmonella infections. However, their effectiveness is being compromised by the emergence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). The genetic determinants encoding ESBL in Salmonella spp. isolated from patients in Kuwait and United Arab Emirates (UAE) were studied over a 2 year period. Out of a total of 407 isolates, 116 isolates possessed the resistance phenotypes consistent with possible ESBL production. Of these, 69 (59.5 {\%}) were ESBL positive. PCR and sequencing were used to determine the genetic determinant(s) responsible for ESBL phenotypes. A total of 14 (12.1 {\%}) and 29 (24.6 {\%}) isolates were CTX-M-15 ESBL producers and TEM producers, respectively. Ten CTX-M-15 producers carried the insertion sequence ISEcpI gene. PFGE analysis revealed identical profiles in 4 of the 13 Kuwaiti strains. This study reports the presence of the bla(CTX-M-15) gene in Salmonella spp. and Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi from Kuwait and UAE for what is believed to be the first time. This is of great concern as the gene is also found in association with the ISEcpI gene, which may easily facilitate its spread.

The striking features of a severe, multiresistant S. aureus polyvisceral disease associated with multiple immune-mediated focal manifestations are in contrast with the community-acquired origin of infection and the apparent absence of supporting factors for both antimicrobial resistance and the unexpected, exaggerated immune activation occurred in an otherwise healthy man. The extensive immune activation status (as demonstrated by a proportionally maintained absolute lymphocyte cont and a T-cell subset study pointing out an increased quote of CD4+, CD34+, and CD4- CD8- cells, compared with a proportional decrease of CD8+ T-lymphocytes) probably had a prominent role in prompting several focal clinical features of our patient, which apparently were not directly related to bacterial invasion, such as the polyvisceritis, the massive pleuric and pericardial effusion, the myocarditis-pericarditis, and the thrombophlebitis occurring in multiple and remote body sites, as compared with to the initial respiratory localization.

METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on the microbiological profiles and antibiotic susceptibilities in 754 strains of pathogens isolated from 519 patients with diabetic foot ulcers at our hospital from January 2010 to August 2013. The inter-group data were compared by Chi-square test. RESULTS: There were 322 (62.0{\%}) males and 197 (38.0{\%}) females. Their mean age was (67.7 +/- 12.3) (30-93) years, duration of diabetes 10 (0-40) years, duration of lower-limb lesion 1.0 (0.0-72.0) months and HbA1c (9.09{\%} +/- 2.28{\%}). Among 444 (85.5{\%}) cases, a total of 754 strains of pathogens were isolated. Gram-positive aerobes were the most frequently isolated (47.3{\%}, 357 strains) and followed by gram-negative aerobes and fungus (40.3{\%} vs 12.3{\%}, 304 vs 93 strains respectively). With rising Wagner's grades, bacterial floras transformed from Gram-positive cocci to Gram-negative rods while fungus and composite infections increased. And 122 strains were of multi drug resistant organisms (MDRO). Among 357 strains of Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis were dominating floras. Staphylococcus was highly resistant to penicillin G, erythromycin, and oxacillin while vancomycin and linezolid were the most effective agents against gram-positive bacteria. Among 304 strains of gram-negative bacteria, enterobacteria were the most prevalent, including 48 strains of Escherichia coli, 34 strains of Proteus mirabilis and 31 strains of Proteus vulgaris. And there were 29 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Enterobacteria were highly resistant to ampicillin, followed by bactrim and furadantin while meropenem, imipenem, piperacillin/sulbactam, sulperazone and cefepime were the most effective agents. The predominant fungus was Blastomyces albicans. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with severe diabetic foot ulcers, Gram-negative rods predominate while the prevalence of fungus and composite infections increases. Vancomycin and imipenem maintain highly antibacterial activity. It is essential to pay attention to pathogen survey and use antibiotics more rationally.",Q Shen and D Lin and H Zhu and S Ge and W Wu and X Pan and X Gu and X Gu and F Shen,"0376-2491 (print)

19093,maybe,sherwood2011,article,"This report summarizes the case of a 23 year-old otherwise healthy male that was injured in an improvised explosive device (IED) blast in support of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). He sustained bilateral open tibia and fibula fractures in the setting of being exposed to water contaminated with raw sewage. Despite long-term carbapenem therapy, the patient's wounds were repeatedly noted to have purulent drainage during surgical debridement and cultures from these wounds were persistently positive for Bacteroides fragilis. Apparent clinical failure persisted despite the addition of metronidazole to his regimen and an eventual trial of tigecycline. Susceptibility testing of the B. fragilis isolate was performed and resistance to penicillin, clindamycin,metronidazole, cefoxitin, meropenem, imipenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, and tigecycline was confirmed. The presence of a nimE gene on a potentially transferrable plasmid was also confirmed by plasmid sequencing. The only antibiotics that displayed in vitro susceptibility were moxifloxacin and linezolid. These antibiotics were initiated in combination with aggressive irrigation and serial surgical debridement. Conversion to left-sided internal fixation became feasible and his left lower extremity was salvaged without residual evidence of infection. The patient completed an eight week course of combination moxifloxacin and linezolid therapy without adverse event. This B. fragilis isolate displayed simultaneous high-level resistance to multiple antibiotics routinely utilized in anaerobic infections. This was evidenced by clinical failure, in vitro susceptibility testing, and demonstration of genes associated with resistance mechanisms. This case warrants review not only due to the rarity of this event but also the potential implications regarding anaerobic infections in traumatic wounds and the success of a novel treatment regimen utilizing combination therapy with moxifloxacin and linezolid.",J E Sherwood and S Fraser and D M Citron and H Wexler and G Blakely and K Jobling and S Patrick,1075-9964,Anaerobe,",Afghan Campaign 2001-,Afghanistan,Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology,Bacterial,Bacterial Proteins/genetics,Bacteroides Infections/blood/*microbiology,Bacteroides fragilis,Bacteroides fragilis/*drug effects/genetics/isolat,Bacteroides infection,Blast Injuries/blood/*microbiology,Drug Resistance,Escherichia coli,Genes,Humans,Leg Injuries/*microbiology,Male,Microbial Sensitivity Tests/methods,Multiple,Young Adult,absence of side effects,adult,antibiotic resistance,antibiotic sensitivity,article,bacterium culture,bacterium isolate,blast injury,blood culture,carbapenem,case report,cefoxitin,cervical spine fracture,clindamycin,debridement,fibula fracture,fracture fixation,human,imipenem,leg injury,linezolid,male,meropenem,metronidazole,moxifloxacin,multidrug resistance,nonhuman,penicillin G,piperacillin plus tazobactam,plasmid,priority journal,tibia fracture,tigecycline,tobramycin,vancomycin,water contamination,wound infection,wound irrigation",152--155,{Multi-drug resistant Bacteroides fragilis recovered from blood and severe leg wounds caused by an improvised explosive device (IED) in Afghanistan},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l51330121 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anaerobe.2011.02.007 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=10759964{\&}id=doi:10.1016{\%}2fj.anaerobe.2011.02.007{\&}atitle=multi,17,2011,4,"from duplicate 1 (multi-drug resistant bacteroides fragilis recovered from blood and severe leg wounds caused by an improvised explosive device (ied) in afghanistan - sherwood, j e; fraser, s; citron, d m; wexler, h; blakely, g; jobling, k; patrick, s)

19396,maybe,sinha2012,article,"Background: The high incidence of ESBL producing strains with scarce prior documentation of the prevalent ESBL genes in Mangalore propulgated this study. It was carried out to evaluate the existence of the CTX-M type genes in ESBL producing strains of Gram negative clinical isolates from Government tertiary care hospital, Mangalore, Karnataka (India). Methods: A total of 116 samples (129 isolates) were collected from patients hospitalised in various wards of Government tertiary care hospital, Mangalore from August 2008 to August 2009. The isolates obtained were identified and confirmed using standard microbiological and biochemical tests. Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 700603 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 were the control strains used. Production of ESBL was tested for all isolates by phenotypic confirmatory test using combination disk containing third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic disk alone (Ceftazidime 30$\mu$g) and in combination with clavulanic acid (Ceftazidime + Clavulanic acid 30/10$\mu$g). A total of 75 isolates from the family Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonas spp which were phenotypically confirmed ESBL producers were evaluated for CTX-M type genes by performingconventional PCR. Results: 58.1{\%} of the clinical isolates were ESBL producers. In our study ESBL production ranged from 40{\%} in Escherichia coli, 34.7{\%} in Klebsiella spp, 16{\%} in Pseudomonas spp, 4{\%} to 1.3{\%} each in Citrobacter spp and Proteus spp. In addition to resistance to third generation cephalosporins, most of these isolates showed resistance to sulfonamides, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin and aztreonam. The ESBL producing strains when subjected to conventional PCR using standard primers showed that out of the 75 isolates tested 51 were positive for blaCTX-M. Conclusion: From the above results, it can be concluded that there is a high prevalence of ESBL producing isolates with CTX-M genes among patients in Government tertiary care hospital, Mangalore. These findings show that in our setting, hospitals provide a favourable environment for the resistant organisms to emerge and disseminate.

We analyzed P. rettgeri clinical isolates with resistance to carbapenems and aminoglycosides in a hospital in Nepal. METHODS: Five clinical isolates of multidrug-resistant P. rettgeri were obtained in a hospital in Nepal. Antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined using the microdilution method and entire genomes were sequenced to determine drug-resistant genes. Epidemiological analysis was performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: Four of the 5 isolates were resistant to carbapenems (imipenem and meropenem), with MICs {\textgreater}/=16 mg/L, with the remaining isolate showing intermediate resistance to imipenem, with an MIC of 2 mg/L and susceptibility to meropenem with an MIC {\textless}/=1 mg/L. All 5 isolates had blaVEB-1. Of the 4 carbapenem-resistant strains, 3 had blaNDM-1 and 1 had blaOXA-72. All isolates were highly resistant to aminoglycosides (MICs {\textgreater}/=1,024 mg/L) and harbored armA.

20333,yes,tada2013a,article,"BACKGROUND: 16S rRNA methylase-producing Gram-negative bacteria are highly resistant to all clinically important aminoglycosides. We analyzed clinical strains of 16S rRNA methylase-producing Acinetobactor baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa obtained from clinical isolates in medical settings in Vietnam. METHODS: From 2008 to 2011, 101 clinical strains of A. baumannii and 15 of P. aeruginosa were isolated from patients in intensive care units (ICUs) in two medical settings in Vietnam. Antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined using the microdilution method and epidemiological analysis was performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and MLST. Genes encoding the 16S rRNA methylases, OXAs and CTX-Ms were analyzed by PCR and sequence analysis. RESULTS: 16S rRNA methylase-producing Gram-negative pathogens were detected in two hospitals in Vietnam. Of the 101 clinical isolates of A. baumannii and the 15 of P. aeruginosa isolated from two ICUs in these hospitals, 72 (71.3{\%}) were highly resistant to amikacin, arbekacin and gentamicin, with MICs greater than 1,024 mg/L. The 16S rRNA methylases ArmA and RmtB were produced by 61 and 9 isolates of A. baumannii, respectively, and RmtB was produced by 2 isolates of P. aeruginosa. Moreover, 52 of the A. baumannii isolates producing 16S rRNA methylases harbored both blaOXA-23-like and blaOXA-51-like genes. Most A. baumannii isolates producing 16S rRNA methylase obtained in hospital A in Hanoi were ST91 and ST231, whereas most from hospital B in Ho Chi Minh City were ST136, ST195, and ST254.

Seven main organisms were collected from SSI at 27 medical centers in 2010 and were shipped to a central laboratory for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. A total of 702 isolates from 586 patients with SSI were included. Staphylococcus aureus (20.4 {\%}) and Enterococcus faecalis (19.5 {\%}) were the most common isolates, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.4 {\%}) and Bacteroides fragilis group (15.4 {\%}). Methicillin-resistant S. aureus among S. aureus was 72.0 {\%}. Vancomycin MIC 2 $\mu$g/ml strains accounted for 9.7 {\%}. In Escherichia coli, 11 of 95 strains produced extended-spectrum $\beta$-lactamase (Klebsiella pneumoniae, 0/53 strains). Of E. coli strains, 8.4 {\%} were resistant to ceftazidime (CAZ) and 26.3 {\%} to ciprofloxacin (CPFX). No P. aeruginosa strains produced metallo-$\beta$-lactamase. In P. aeruginosa, the resistance rates were 7.4 {\%} to tazobactam/piperacillin (TAZ/PIPC), 10.2 {\%} to imipenem (IPM), 2.8 {\%} to meropenem, cefepime, and CPFX, and 0 {\%} to gentamicin. In the B. fragilis group, the rates were 28.6 {\%} to clindamycin, 5.7 {\%} to cefmetazole, 2.9 {\%} to TAZ/PIPC and IPM, and 0 {\%} to metronidazole (Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron; 59.1, 36.4, 0, 0, 0 {\%}).

The occurrence and cassette content of integrons as well as the molecular mechanisms of resistance among the multidrug-resistant (MDR) S. Typhi were evaluated. Thirty-nine percent of the isolates were susceptible to all the antimicrobial agents tested. Seven of the S. Typhi strains were MDR. None of the 121 S. enterica isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin, cefazolin, rifampicin or kanamycin. All MDR S. Typhi isolates contained a class 1 integron with a single cassette, dfrA7, conferring resistance to trimethoprim. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of XbaI-generated genomic restriction fragments yielded 12 different patterns. Five of the seven MDR isolates containing class 1 integrons had an identical PFGE pattern. Resistance to sulfamethoxazole, streptomycin, ampicillin, tetracycline and chloramphenicol was mediated by sul1, strA-strB, blaTEM-like, tetB and catA genes, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of integron-associated multidrug resistance as well as the first molecular characterisation of the mechanism of resistance of S.

S.putrefaciens is a gram-negative, facultative anaerobic and non-fermentative rod that rarely causes infections in humans. First, the authors reported that antibotic sensitivity tests of S.putrefaciens in the presented case were performed by Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. However, there is no recommendation about the antibiotic susceptibility testing by disc diffusion test for this bacteria in Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI), European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST), and British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC) guidelines. According to CLSI criteria, antibiotic susceptibility tests for S.putrefaciens should be done by a method which detects minimal inhibitory concentration. Second, this paper reported that S.putrefaciens was sensitive to third generation cephalosporins and penicillins. Besides, the authors suggested that susceptibility of these bacteria to these antibiotics was helpful for the differential diagnosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and S.putrefaciens.

21081,maybe,trevino2012a,article,"Susceptibility testing of clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria is not considered, often, mandatory in routine clinical practice and the treatments are empirically established. Thus, periodic monitoring of the susceptibility patterns of anaerobic bacteria is advisable. The aim of this study was to update on resistance of Bacteroides fragilis group in our Institution with special attention to carbapenems reporting metallo-beta-lactamase producing strains for the first time in Spain, and to compare fingerprinting analysis results obtained by using automated rep-PCR (DiversiLab System) and MALDI-TOF MS. A total of 830 non-duplicated clinical isolates of the B. fragilis group recovered from the years 2006 to 2010 were studied. B. fragilis was the most prevalent species (59.5{\%}). The total susceptibility of B. fragilis group isolates were: penicillin, 13.3{\%}; amoxicillin/clavulanic, 89.6{\%}; piperacillin-tazobactam, 91.8{\%}; cefoxitin, 65.8{\%}; ertapenem, 95.9{\%}; imipenem, 98.2{\%}; clindamycin, 53.4{\%} and metronidazole, 96.4{\%}. The percentage of sensitive isolates did not change significantly over time for amoxicillin/clavulanic, cefoxitin, clindamycin and metronidazole. A slight increase in the rate of resistance to ertapenem and imipenem was observed. Imipenem resistance and carbapenemase production were detected for the first time in our laboratory in the year 2007. No other report of carbapenemase-producing B. fragilis in our country has been previously published. Six imipenem-resistant isolates were MBL-producing and PCR positive for cfiA gene. Four of them were PCR positive for IS-like immediately upstream cfiA gene and two of them were negative. Both, automated rep-PCR (DiversiLab) and MALDI-TOF MS, revealed a great genetic diversity among carbapenem-producing strains suggesting the acquisition of novel resistance genes more than clonal dissemination of them. Both methods seem to be useful tools for fast and accurate identification and strain typing of B. fragilis group in the daily laboratory routine. Because of the relevant increase observed in Bacteroides species isolated from blood cultures and the appearance of carbapenemase-producing strains in our Institution, we recommend to test the antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates, at least in the most severe patients.",M Trevino and P Areses and M D Penalver and S Cortizo and F Pardo and M L {del Molino} and C Garcia-Riestra and M Hernandez and J Llovo and B J Regueiro,1075-9964,Anaerobe,"Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology,Bacterial Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics,Bacterial Typing Techniques,Bacteroides fragilis/classification/*drug effects/,Carbapenems/*pharmacology,Drug Resistance, Bacterial/*genetics,Female,Genotype,Humans,Male,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Middle Aged,Phenotype,Phylogeny,Polymerase Chain Reaction,Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorpti,beta-Lactamases/*biosynthesis/genetics",37--43,{Susceptibility trends of Bacteroides fragilis group and characterisation of carbapenemase-producing strains by automated REP-PCR and MALDI TOF},NA,18,2012,1,"1095-8274

21150,maybe,tsakris2009,article,"During a 3-year period (May 2005 to April 2008), a series of 45 outpatients presented with community-onset urinary tract infections due to carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. Forty of them had a history of previous hospitalization or exposure to healthcare facilities, while the remaining five had not been previously admitted to our healthcare facilities or elsewhere within the preceding 12 months. In 18 outpatients, the carbapenem-resistant organisms caused recurrent community-onset urinary tract infections, while in three outpatients the organisms were also implicated in bacteremic episodes. All 45 single-patient P. aeruginosa isolates harbored the blaVIM-2 metallo-$\beta$-lactamase (MBL) gene in a common class 1 integron structure. They belonged to one predominant pulsed-field gel electrophoresis type and three sporadically detected types; two of the sporadic clonal types were identified among outpatients without previous exposure to healthcare facilities, while the predominant clonal type was also identified to cause infections in hospitalized patients. This is the first study documenting that MBL-producing P. aeruginosa isolates cause community-onset infections that are related or not with exposure to healthcare facilities. Community-onset infections in our patients most likely resulted from the nosocomial acquisition of MBL producers, followed by a prolonged digestive carriage. The high rate of recurrent infections in the community underlies the difficulty of constraining infections caused by such microorganisms in the extrahospital setting.

21427,yes,valdezate2009,article,"Objectives: A large clonal outbreak of multidrug-resistant CC17 ST17 Enterococcus faecium containing Tn 5382 in a hospital in the north of Spain is described. Methods: We characterized vancomycin-resistant E. faecium isolates from 10 infected and 40 colonized inpatients from a single hospital by PFGE, multiple-locus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Genes encoding antibiotic resistance (ampicillin, aminoglycosides, macrolides, quinupristin/dalfopristin, quinolones, tetracycline) and putative virulence traits were analysed. Results: All isolates showed highly similar PFGE profiles and were assigned to the type MT1 by MLVA and to ST17 (CC17) by MLST. The Tn 5382 type identified in all isolates was linked to pbp5 and contained a 5 bp deletion and 10 point mutations within the intergenic vanSB -vanYB region. Other resistance genes identified were erm (B), mef (E), tet (M), ant(6â²)-Ia, aph(3â²)-IIIa and aac(6â²)-Ie-aph(2â³)-Ia. All isolates carried the unexpressed tet (M) gene. The high level of ciprofloxacin resistance was attributable to the first described Gly-61 and Ile-80 mutations in ParC and the Tyr-83 or Arg-83 mutations in GyrA. All isolates contained esp. The presence of hyl was variable. Conclusions: A large clonal outbreak caused by multidrug-resistant CC17 E. faecium containing pbp5-Tn 5382 is described. The persistence of this clone, which has been recovered from both hospital and community settings since 2005, and the possibility of transferring this Tn 5382 to other epidemic ampicillin-resistant clonal types currently circulating in Spain might contribute to increasing the prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in our area.

We report a case of endocarditis and meningitis in which methicillin- resistant CNSA was isolated from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood and, probably, from the prosthetic aortic valve. Methods: Case report and review of the English and Spanish medical literature. Results: On 7 September 2009, a 67-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for fever, chills, vomiting, rigor and confusion. She had underwent mitral and aortic valves replacement two months before. For suspected central nervous system infection a lumbar puncture was performed. CSF showed 92 leucocites/mm3 (74{\%} PMN), proteins 0.85 g/L and glucose 98 mg/dL. She was started on vancomycin and meropenem therapy. On hospital day 3, she began with signs of heart failure. Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showed multiple vegetations on mitral valve, periprosthetic abscess and severe periprosthetic mitral regurgitation. At this time, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was isolated from blood and CSF cultures, so treatment was changed to vancomycin, gentamicin and rifampin. She underwent aortic and mitral prosthetic valves replacement. An external laboratory reported us the isolation of MRSA from the prosthetic aortic valve. She presented multiorganic failure with renal insufficiency and vancomycin was changed to linezolid. After six weeks with antibiotics, a new TEE showed new vegetations and periprosthetic mitral valve regurgitation, so new cardiac surgery was performed. S. aureus isolated from blood and CSF was repeatedly catalase negative. Reference laboratory reported that both strains belonged to the same mixed phage group. We have found other 25 documented cases of CNSA human infection or colonization. Most cases came from Europe (13/26). Patients were predominantly male (15/25), with a mean age of 53 years (range, 1-80) and frecuently had underlying conditions. Six out of 16 reported autcomes were fatal. The most frecuent culture sources were blood (12/25) and wound or soft tissue samples (10/25). Seven out of20 strains were methicillin-resistant.

22218,maybe,wang2012m,article,"Eighteen out of 45 children were reported to have a respiratory illness during an outbreak at a temporary dormitory in a nursery school in China in 2011. To study the outbreak and to determine the risk factors for infection, an epidemiological investigation was performed. A standardized questionnaire was completed for a total of 45 children with the help of their guardians and parents. In addition, acute- and convalescent-phase serum samples and throat swabs from the children were taken for laboratory diagnosis. The diagnosis of a Mycoplasma-like illness was based on the following clinical criteria. The criteria were onset of illness after 31 May 2011, characterized by a cough, fever({\textgreater}37.5 degrees C), or at least 3 of the following symptoms: fever, sore throat, cough or expectoration, and runny or stuffy nose. PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), determination of MICs, and sequencing were performed to determine the genotype, antibiotic resistance, and sequence polymorphisms of the isolated strains, respectively. The paired sera revealed that 15 patients were infected with Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Epidemiology confirmed that this was a point source outbreak, characterized by a short incubation period, a high secondary attack rate, and a long period of hospitalization. PCR-RFLP analysis revealed that the 12 isolated strains of M. pneumoniae shared the same subtype P1 gene, and 23S rRNA sequence analysis showed that these strains harbored two macrolide-resistant gene-related point mutations at position 2063 and 2617. In this outbreak, the major risk factor was the distance between the bed of the first patient and the beds of close contacts (beds less than three meters apart). The strains isolated in this study were found to harbor two point mutations conferring macrolide resistance, indicating the importance of pathogen and drug resistance surveillance systems.",Y Wang and S Qiu and G Yang and L Song and W Su and Y Xu and L Jia and L Wang and R Hao and C Zhang and J Liu and X Fu and J He and J Zhang and Z Li and H Song,"0066-4804

The objective of this study was to investigate reports of skin infection in personnel working with a foal with community-associated MRSA colonization and subsequent infection. Clinical diagnostic specimens were collected from individuals reporting skin lesions following contact with the affected foal. Nasal and groin screening swabs were collected from other veterinary personnel that attended a voluntary screening clinic. MRSA skin infections were identified in three neonatal intensive care unit personnel. Nasal colonization was subsequently identified in 10/103 (9.7{\%}) other veterinary hospital personnel. Isolates were indistinguishable by pulsed field gel electrophoresis, classified as Canadian epidemic MRSA-5, possessed SCCmecIV, were negative for the Panton-Valentine leukocidin and were multidrug resistant.

The presence of KPC was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The KPC-encoding plasmid was analysed by transconjugation experiments, DNA sequencing, Southern blotting and isoelectric focussing. Typing was performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). An ertapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae with low minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) to other cabapenems (tested by the Vitek system) was isolated from the index patient in January 2008. A KPC-2 was identified after K. pneumoniae with identical susceptibility patterns had been isolated from two more patients. Despite the introduction of infection control measures, transmission occurred in five additional patients and three of the patients died from infections. The source of the outbreak strain remained unclear; however, the Tn4401-containing bla KPC-2 gene was similar to previously described isolates from Greece. Five months after the end of the outbreak, a KPC-K. pneumoniae was isolated from a patient who had been treated in Greece previously. Retrospectively, this patient was treated in November 2007 on the same unit as the index case. Typing revealed that all patients were colonised by the same strain.

Isolate MB193997E displayed a beta-lactam resistance phenotype consistent with chromosomal beta-lactamase overproduction. No bla(TEM), bla(SHV) or bla(CTX-M) genes could be amplified in either strain; however, amplification by PCR was found with primers for the bla(OXY-2) gene. This beta-lactamase gene in MU946294N differed by one mutation from the all other bla(OXY) genes previously reported, with an amino acid substitution Alanine237 Threonine enhancing the binding of cefotaxime.

RMP-enhanced tubercle bacilli that grew poorly without RMP but grew better in its presence were isolated from the patient with treatment failure. The bacteria grown without RMP consisted of mixed morphologies of short rod-shaped acid-fast bacteria and poorly stained coccoid bacteria, but stained normally as acid-fast rods when grown in the presence of RMP. The isolated RMP-enhanced bacteria harbored the common S531L mutation and a novel mutation F584S in the rpoB gene. Treatment containing RMP or replacement of RMP with more powerful rifapentine paradoxically aggravated the disease, but its removal led to successful cure of the patient. This study highlights the potential dangers of continued treatment of MDR-TB with rifamycins that can occur due to delayed or absent drug susceptibility results and calls for timely detection of RMP-dependent/-enhanced bacteria in treatment failure patients by including RMP in culture media and removal of RMP from treatment regimen upon detection.",M Zhong and X Zhang and Y Wang and C Zhang and G Chen and P Hu and M Li and B Zhu and W Zhang and Y Zhang,1027-3719,Int J Tuberc Lung Dis,"Adult,Antibiotics, Antitubercular/*pharmacology,Bacterial Proteins/genetics,DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases,Humans,Male,Mutation,Mycobacterium tuberculosis/drug effects/genetics,Rifampin/*analogs {\&} derivatives/pharmacology,Treatment Failure,Tuberculosis, Multidrug-Resistant/*drug therapy/mi",40--44,{An interesting case of rifampicin-dependent/-enhanced multidrug-resistant tuberculosis},NA,14,2010,1,"1815-7920

23702,maybe,na:29,article,"BACKGROUND: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the major nosocomial opportunistic pathogen, is an important cause of infectious morbidity and mortality among immunocompromised patients. OBJECTIVE: To establish the role of metallo-beta-lactamases (MBL) and efflux-mediated mechanisms in confer- ring carbapenem resistance in nosocomial isolates of P. aeruginosa. METHODS: We analyzed carbapenem nonsusceptible nosocomial P. aeruginosa isolates obtained from pediatric and adult patients at three hospitals in Moscow in 2012-2015. Carbapenem susceptibility was assessed using the E-test. In addition, minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of meropenem were tested by the broth microdilution method. The presence of MBL was determined using the ED TA-mediated suppression test. Efflux-dependent resistance was measured using an assay based on MIC modification by an ionophore carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenyl hydrazine (CCCP). RESULTS: A total of 54 carbapenem nonsusceptible P. aeruginosa isolates was examined. The presence of an MBL was detected in 37 (69{\%}) isolates, 29 (54{\%}) isolates had efflux-mediated resistance. In 10 (19{\%}) isolates neither MBL nor efflux activity was found. Five out of 6 isolates (83{\%}) with highly active efflux were MBL-positive. Among isolates with low efflux activity, 74{\%} (17/23) possessed MBL, whereas in isolates with no efflux the rate of MBL-positivity was 60{\%} (15/25). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of MBL- and efflux-mediated carbapenem resistance in nosocomial P. aeruginosa is high. Moreover, our results reveal that several resistance mechanisms may combine at the isolate level. These data may contribute to the development of novel strategies in combating carbapenem resistance.",NA,"0869-6047 (print)

267,yes,ahmed2008,article,"Citrobacter freundii strain 4306 was isolated from a urine specimen of a patient in March 2006 in Palestine. This strain showed a unique multidrug resistance phenotype, as it was resistant both to 7-$\alpha$-methoxy- and oxyimino-cephalosporins, including cefepime, cefpirome and monobactams, in addition to quinolones, streptomycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Clavulanic acid did not act synergistically with cephalosporins by the double-disk synergy test. Molecular characterisation showed that the resistance to 7-$\alpha$-methoxy- and oxyimino-cephalosporins was due to a novel AmpC $\beta$-lactamase, designated CMY-37, with an isoelectric point of â¼9.0. CMY-37 is a variant of C. freundii chromosomal AmpC enzymes with at least seven amino acid substitutions. One of these substitutions, L316I, is located within the R2 loop that is considered the hotspot region responsible for the extended substrate spectrum in class C $\beta$-lactamases. The blaCMY-37 gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli TG1. CMY-37 is chromosomally encoded and is not associated with ISEcp1-like element. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that CMY-37 is the origin of many plasmid-mediated AmpC $\beta$-lactamases. This study highlights the emergence of cefepime and cefpirome resistance in C. freundii owing to a new type of AmpC $\beta$-lactamase. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. and the International Society of Chemotherapy.",A M Ahmed and T Shimamoto,"0924-8579 (print)

We, therefore, aimed to delineate its current incidence, etiologic, clinical, laboratory spectra, and the effect of steroid therapy on the outcome. METHODOLOGY: Babies admitted from 1992 to 1995 in the Special Care Baby Unit of the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital, Maduguri, Nigeria, with bacterial meningitis were studied prospectively. Neonatal bacterial meningitis was confirmed if the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) microbiological, chemical, immunological and clinical criteria were satisfied. Detailed neurological follow-up was made. RESULT: Sixty-nine cases of neonatal bacterial meningitis were encountered, (25 were early-onset, and 44 late-onset); the incidence was 6.5/1000 live births. 22 Positive CSF cultures were grown in early-onset meningitis, and 28 in late-onset disease. Low birth weight showed higher risk of bacterial meningitis and it was significantly more likely in the preterm. X2 = 24.19, p = 0.000001). Gram-negative pathogens were more isolated (28/50, 56{\%}); Escherichia coli (11) being the commonest, while of the Gram-positive pathogens Staphylococcus aureus was most predominant overall (13/50). Concomitant blood culture was positive in 39/50 (78{\%}), inclusive of all 22 {""}definite{""} early-onset disease. The CSF WBC was minimally raised (25-30 x 10(6)/L) in 11 (22{\%}) of {""}definite{""} neonatal bacterial meningitis. Detection of unusual pathogens was noteworthy: N. meningitidis (2) and H. influenzae (2), contributing 0.6 and 2.2 per 1000 live births and admissions, respectively. Overall mortality was 24.6{\%}. Of the forty survivors, 9 (22.5{\%}) had neurological sequelae: sensorineural hearing deficit (3), hydrocephalus (2), subdural effusion (2), hemiparesis (1), afebrile (recurrent) seizure (1), and there was reduced developmental quotients at 24 months follow-up in 33. Dexamethasone therapy decreased mortality significantly; p = 0.0004. CONCLUSION: The new information highlighted by this research includes the lack of Group B Streptococcus isolation, the finding of S. pneumoniae, N. meningitidis, H. influenzae and S. aureus as significant pathogens, usefulness of blood cultures in the detection of neonatal bacterial meningitis, increasing resistance of Gram-positive neonatal pathogens to cloxacillin, low CSF WBC, and the finding that the adjunctive use of dexamethasone significantly decreases case fatality and neurological sequelae.",K I Airede and O Adeyemi and T Ibrahim,1119-3077 (print),Niger J Clin Pract,"Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use,Anti-Inflammatory Agents/*therapeutic use,Dexamethasone/*therapeutic use,Female,Glucocorticoids/*therapeutic use,Humans,Incidence,Infant, Low Birth Weight,Infant, Newborn,Male,Meningitis, Bacterial/cerebrospinal fluid/*diagnos,Nigeria/epidemiology,Prospective Studies,Risk Factors",235--245,{Neonatal bacterial meningitis and dexamethasone adjunctive usage in Nigeria},NA,11,2008,3,"airede, k i

Despite high serum levels of vancomycin, the same S. aureus strain was isolated from five blood culture sets during 1 week. Treatment failure under therapeutic levels of vancomycin prompted us to investigate the resistance profile of this strain in further detail. The MIC values for vancomycin as determined by Etest and microdilution were 3.0 and 2.0 mg/liter, respectively, and remained unchanged during the treatment course. The macro-Etest method showed a MIC of 4 mg/liter. The strain showed liquid vancomycin and lysostaphin MBCs of 2.0 and 5.0 mg/liter, respectively. The isolates were confirmed as heterogeneously vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (hVISA) by vancomycin population analysis profile. The areas under these curves were similar for Mu3 and D958 for vancomycin and teicoplanin (ratio values were 1 and 1.1 for vancomycin and teicoplanin, respectively). Extensive genotyping and molecular characterization demonstrated that the strain harbored a staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec element (SCCmec) type III cassette and was of sequence type ST241, a single-locus variant of the successful multiresistant clone ST239. Microarray results demonstrated that D958 contained numerous resistance determinants (generally plasmid or phage encoded). These results suggest that this strain is constitutively expressing an altered susceptibility to vancomycin. Further studies are warranted to assess the clonal distribution of such strains displaying reduced susceptibility to vancomycin prior to any antimicrobial therapy.",S Al-Obeid and Q Haddad and A Cherkaoui and J Schrenzel and P FranÃ§ois and P Francois,0095-1137,J Clin Microbiol,",*Vancomycin Resistance,Aged,Anti-Bacterial Agents/analysis/*pharmacology/thera,Bacterial,Bacterial Typing Techniques,Bacterial/genetics,Blood/microbiology,Chromosomes,Cluster Analysis,DNA,DNA Fingerprinting,Genes,Genotype,Humans,Lysostaphin/pharmacology,Male,Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus/*drug,Microarray Analysis,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Microbial Viability/drug effects,Plasmids,Saudi Arabia,Sepsis/*microbiology,Serum/chemistry,Staphylococcal Infections/*microbiology,Staphylococcus aureus,Teicoplanin/pharmacology,Vancomycin/analysis/*pharmacology/therapeutic use,abdominal pain,aged,antimicrobial therapy,area under the curve,article,asthma,bacterium detection,bacterium isolate,blood culture,brain hemorrhage,case report,chemical structure,chromosome,ciprofloxacin,clindamycin,cotrimoxazole,drug sensitivity,drug substitution,erythromycin,fever,fusidic acid,genotype,gentamicin,heart failure,human,hypertension,kidney failure,levofloxacin,linezolid,lysostaphin,male,meropenem,meticillin,minimum inhibitory concentration,penicillin G,priority journal,purification,rifampicin,sepsis,systolic dysfunction,teicoplanin,tigecycline,treatment duration,treatment failure,vancomycin",2199--2204,{First detection of an invasive Staphylococcus aureus strain (D958) with reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides in Saudi Arabia},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l358912807 http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/jcm.00954-09 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=00951137{\&}id=doi:10.1128{\%}2fjcm.00954-09{\&}atitle=first+detection+of+an+in,48,2010,6,"from duplicate 1 (first detection of an invasive staphylococcus aureus strain (d958) with reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides in saudi arabia - al-obeid, s; haddad, q; cherkaoui, a; schrenzel, j; francois, p)

598,maybe,almyroudis2011,article,"OBJECTIVE: To study the molecular epidemiology of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) colonization and to identify modifiable risk factors among patients with hematologic malignancies. SETTING: A hematology-oncology unit with high prevalence of VRE colonization. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with hematologic malignancies and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients admitted to the hospital. METHODS: Patients underwent weekly surveillance by means of perianal swabs for VRE colonization and, if colonized, were placed in contact isolation. We studied the molecular epidemiology in fecal and blood isolates by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis over a 1-year period. We performed a retrospective case-control study over a 3-year period. Cases were defined as patients colonized by VRE, and controls were defined as patients negative for VRE colonization. Case patients and control patients were matched by admitting service and length of observation time. RESULTS: Molecular genotyping demonstrated the primarily polyclonal nature of VRE isolates. Colonization occurred at a median of 14 days. Colonized patients were characterized by longer hospital admissions. Previous use of ceftazidime was associated with VRE colonization (P {\textless} .001), while use of intravenous vancomycin and antibiotics with anaerobic activity did not emerge as a risk factor. There was no association with neutropenia or presence of colonic mucosal disruption, and severity of illness was similar in both groups. CONCLUSION: Molecular studies showed that in the majority of VRE-colonized patients the strains were unique, arguing that VRE acquisition was sporadic rather than resulting from a common source of transmission. Patient-specific factors, including prior antibiotic exposure, rather than breaches in infection control likely predict for risk of fecal VRE colonization.",N G Almyroudis and A J Lesse and T Hahn and G Samonis and P A Hazamy and K Wongkittiroch and E S Wang and P L {McCarthy Jr.} and M Wetzler and B H Segal and P L McCarthy and M Wetzler and B H Segal,0899-823x,Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology,",*Vancomycin Resistance,80 and over,Adolescent,Adult,Aged,Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use,Bacterial/analysis,Case-Control Studies,Child,Cross Infection/*complications/*epidemiology/trans,DNA,Electrophoresis,Enterococcus/*genetics/isolation {\&} purification,Female,Gel,Genotype,Gram-Positive Bacterial,Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications,Hodgkin disease,Humans,Infections/complications/*epidemiology/microbiolog,Length of Stay,Male,Middle Aged,Molecular Epidemiology,Preschool,Pulsed-Field,Retrospective Studies,Risk Factors,Young Adult,acute lymphoblastic leukemia,acute myeloblastic leukemia,adolescent,adult,aged,anaerobic capacity,article,bacteremia,bacterial colonization,bacterium isolate,blood analysis,case control study,catheter infection,ceftazidime,child,chronic lymphatic leukemia,chronic myeloid leukemia,clindamycin,clinical article,clinical observation,controlled study,diarrhea,disease course,disease surveillance,febrile neutropenia,feces analysis,female,graft recipient,hematologic malignancy,hematopoietic stem cell transplantation,hospital admission,human,imipenem,length of stay,leukocyte count,leukopenia,liquid feces,male,meropenem,metronidazole,molecular epidemiology,multiple myeloma,myelodysplastic syndrome,myeloproliferative disorder,neutropenia,neutrophil count,nonhodgkin lymphoma,nonhuman,piperacillin plus tazobactam,preschool child,prevalence,pulsed field gel electrophoresis,retrospective study,risk factor,school child,tobramycin,treatment outcome,vancomycin,vancomycin resistant Enterococcus",490--496,{Molecular epidemiology and risk factors for colonization by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus in patients with hematologic malignancies},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l361687704 http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/659408 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=0899823x{\&}id=doi:10.1086{\%}2f659408{\&}atitle=molecular+epidemiology+and+risk+fact,32,2011,5,"from duplicate 2 (molecular epidemiology and risk factors for colonization by vancomycin-resistant enterococcus in patients with hematologic malignancies - almyroudis, n g; lesse, a j; hahn, t; samonis, g; hazamy, p a; wongkittiroch, k; wang, e s; mccarthy jr., p l; wetzler, m; segal, b h)

627,yes,alt2015,article,"Introduction: In January 2013, the National Reference Centre for Salmonella (NRC) detected a salmonellosis cluster in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany, caused by uncommon O4 non-agglutinating, monophasic Salmonella (S.) Typhimurium DT193. Circulating predominant monophasicS. Typhimurium DT193 clones typically display resistance phenotype ASSuT. We investigated common exposures to control the outbreak, and conducted microbiological investigations to assess the strains' phenotype. Methods: We conducted a case-control study defining cases as persons living or working in Saxony-Anhalt diagnosed with the O4 non-agglutinating strain between January and March 2013. We selected two controls contemporarily reported with norovirus infection, frequencymatched on residence and age group, per case. We interviewed regarding food consumption, especially pork and its place of purchase. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) with 95{\%} confidence intervals (95{\%} CI) using logistic regression. The NRC investigated human and food isolates by PCR, SDS-PAGE, MLST, PFGE, MLVA and susceptibility testing. Results: Altogether, 68 O4 non-agglutinating human isolates were confirmed between January and April 2013. Of those, 61 were assigned to the outbreak (median age 57 years, 44{\%} female); 83{\%} cases â¥ 60 years were hospitalized. Eating raw minced pork from butcheries within 3 days was associated with disease (31 cases, 28 controls; OR adjusted for sex: 3.6; 95{\%} CI: 1.0-13). Phage type DT193 and MLST ST34 were assigned, and isolates' lipopolysaccharide (LPS) matched control strains. Isolates linked to Saxony-Anhalt exhibited PFGE type 5. ASSuT- and ACSSuT phenotype proportions were 34 and 39{\%} respectively; 54{\%} were resistant to chloramphenicol. Three pork isolates matched the outbreak strain. Discussion: Raw minced pork was the most likely infection vehicle in this first reported outbreak caused by O4 non-agglutinating, mostly chloramphenicol-resistant S. Typhimurium DT193. High hospitalization proportions demand awareness on the risk of consumption of raw pork among elderly. LPS analysis indicated O4 expression; therefore, testing with antisera from different lots is recommendable in unexpected agglutination reactions.",K Alt and S Simon and C Helmeke and C Kohlstock and R Prager and E Tietze and W Rabsch and I Karagiannis and D Werber and C Frank and A Fruth,1932-6203,PLoS ONE,"Germany,O4 non agglutinating Salmonella typhimurium,Salmonella,adult,age distribution,aged,antibiotic resistance,antibiotic sensitivity,article,bacterial strain,bacterium isolate,bacterium lipopolysaccharide,case control study,chloramphenicol,controlled study,epidemic,female,food intake,food safety,human,interview,major clinical study,male,nonhuman,norovirus infection,pork,residential area,salmonellosis",NA,"{Outbreak of uncommon O4 non-agglutinating Salmonella typhimurium linked to Minced Pork, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany, January to April 2013}",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l604923625 http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0128349 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=19326203{\&}id=doi:10.1371{\%}2fjournal.pone.0128349{\&}atitle=outbreak,10,2015,6,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,maybe,cale,yes,ayomide,ayomide,zach,yes,zm_6.csv,NA,NA,zm_6_1.mex,yes,journal

925,yes,arai2011,article,"Objectives: Streptococcus pyogenes causes various diseases in humans. While the prevalence of fluoroquinolone-resistant S. pyogenes isolates has been increasing since 2000 in the USA and Europe, it has remained very low in Japan. We isolated a fluoroquinolone-resistant S. pyogenes strain and analysed its genetics. Methods: TU-296, a strain of S. pyogenes resistant to levofloxacin (MIC 16 mg/L), was isolated from the throat of a patient in their thirties with pharyngitis in autumn 2007. We carried out susceptibility tests for various antimicrobial agents and PCR analysis of the genes gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE in the quinolone resistance-determining region, followed by sequencing of the PCR products to find mutation(s) and the resulting amino acid substitution(s). We then sequenced the PCR product of the emm gene and determined the emm genotype. Results: S. pyogenes TU-296 was found to have the following mutations and amino acid substitutions: adenine 476 to cytosine in gyrA and cytosine 367 to thymine in parC, resulting in Glu-85âAla in GyrA and Ser-79âPhe in ParC. The genotype of the isolate was emm11. Conclusions: Amino acid substitutions in fluoroquinolone-resistant S. pyogenes have already been reported from Europe and the USA, including Ser-81âPhe or Tyr and Met-99âLeu in GyrA, as well as Ser-79âPhe, Tyr or Ala and others in ParC. Numerous point mutations were found in parC and parE of S. pyogenes TU-296. In addition, a new amino acid substitution was detected (Glu-85âAla in GyrA). To our knowledge, there have been no previous reports of this substitution in a clinical isolate of S. pyogenes. {\textcopyright} The Author 2010.

Methods We describe the contact tracing investigation undertaken after the presentation of an adult with XDR-TB. Active cases were treated with an XDR-TB drug regimen and contacts underwent a programme of follow-up for 2 years. All isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) were assessed early using whole genome sequencing (WGS) as well as routine drug susceptibility testing (DST). Results Thirty-three contacts were screened. In the first year one confirmed and one probable case were identified through contact tracing. A further possible case was identified through epidemiological links. Two confirmed cases were identified through WGS 2 years later. Twenty-five (80{\%}) contacts without evidence of tuberculosis were adherent to 1 year of follow-up and 14 (45{\%}) were adherent to 2 years of follow-up. WGS of Mtb was used to guide drug choices, rapidly identify transmission events, and alter public health management. Conclusion WGS of Mtb enabled rapid effective individualized treatment and facilitated public health interventions by early identification of transmission events.",A Arnold and A A Witney and S Vergnano and A Roche and C A Cosgrove and A Houston and K A Gould and J Hinds and P Riley and D Macallan and P D Butcher and T S Harrison,"1532-2742

2459,yes,bouallegue2013,article,"Introduction: Recently, multidrug resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae especially Carbapenemase-producing has been identified in Tunisia and becoming an epidemic emergent widely spread phenomenon. Objectives: To describe the epidemiologic profile of nosocomial infections caused by K. pneumoniae. Methods: A prospective surveillance study was performaed at a university hospital of Sahloul (Sousse-Tunisia) from july 2011 to march 2012. K. pneumoniae isolates were identified in the clinical laboratory by biochemical tests and the Analytical Profile index procedure (API 20-NE - Biom{\'{e}}rieux, France). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by standardized methods recommended by the National Committee of Clinical Laboratory Standards. Occurrence of beta-lactamases was detected by PCR amplification and sequencing of ESBL genes (blaTEM, blaSHV, blaCTX-M) and carbapenemase genes (blaOXA-48). ERICPCRgenotyping were used to assess genetic heterogeneity between the isolates. MIC determinations for carbapenems were performed by Etest (bioM{\'{e}}rieux). Results: Forty three strains were collected from 43 patients admitted in the ICU and the urology service. The repeat isolates were excluded from the study. All the patients in our study have had indwelling intravascular devices or were exposed to invasive procedures. During the study period two epidemic periods was declared: the first one occurred between august and September 2011 and the second between December and February 2012. Antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of all clinical isolates revealed four different profiles based on sensivity patterns against fosfomycin, colistin, co-trimxazole, tygecyclin and aminosides. PCR and sequencing analysis revealed that the isolates harbored the blaCTX gene, the blaSHV and the blaOXA-48 gene. Conclusion: There is a serious need to accentuate on the rational use of antimicrobials and strictly adhere to the concept of the âreserve drugâ to minimize the misuse of available antimicrobials. In addition regular antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance, knowledge and its application is essential to reduced current drug resistance rate in hospital as well as in community, in addition to the implementation of basic hygiene precautions.",O BouallÃ¨gue and N Jaidane and L Dhidah and A Masoudi and N Boujaafar,2047-2994,Antimicrobial Resistance and Infection Control,"France,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Tunisia,antibiotic sensitivity,antiinfective agent,beta lactamase,carbapenem derivative,carbapenemase,clinical laboratory,colistin,community,devices,drug resistance,epidemic,epsilometer test,extended spectrum beta lactamase,fosfomycin,gene,genetic heterogeneity,hospital,hospital infection,human,hygiene,infection control,invasive procedure,minimum inhibitory concentration,patient,prevention,procedures,university hospital,urology",NA,{Incidence of carbapenemase-producing Klebsialla pneumoniae at the University Hospital of Salloul (Sousse-Tunisia)},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l72036314 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=20472994{\&}id=doi:{\&}atitle=incidence+of+carbapenemase-producing+klebsialla+pneumoniae+at+the+university+hospital+,2,2013,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,yes,allison,yes,nchedo,nchedo,zach,yes,zm_6.csv,NA,NA,zm_6_1.mex,yes,journal

Here, S. aureus ST398 isolated from patients, health care workers (HCW) and environmental samples in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of Montpellier Hospital were characterized with the aim to understand the circulation of this pathogen into the ICU. Methods: One hundred and twenty-five S. aureus were isolated between February and June 2011 in the ICU from patients, HCWs and environment, and typed by MultiLocus Sequence typing (MLST). S. aureus ST398 strains were analyzed by double-locus sequence typing (DLST) and accessory gene regulation (agr) typing. Resistance to antibiotics was detected by disk-diffusion method. Macrolidelincosamide- streptogramin type B (MLSB) resistant strains were screened by PCR for erm(A), erm(C), erm(T) and msr(A) genes. Virulence genes were detected by specific PCRs. Results: Out of the 125 isolates, 29 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) ST398 or variant were isolated in nasal carriage and invasive diseases in five patients (n = 12), nasal colonization of two HCWs (n = 2) and environmental samples (n = 15). For the first time, four isolates were identified as variant of ST 398 with a mutation in the pta gene. All isolates were agr1 and DLST-type 144-186. Erythromycin resistance and inducible MLSB phenotype were observed for 76{\%} of the isolates. Seven environmental isolates showed additional resistance to Kanamycin, Tobramycin and Gentamicin. All strains harbored the erm(T) gene and different combinations of erm(A) and erm(C) and the absence of msr(A). No isolate contained the genes encoding the Panton Valentine Leukocidin, TSST-1 and Staphylococcal Enterotoxin A. No history of contact with livestock was identified in patients and HCWs. Two patients presented nosocomial pneumonia after acquired-nasal colonization. Conclusion: Isolation of MSSA ST398 strains in patients, HCWs and environment in an ICU during short time period underlines the capacity of this emerging pathogen to rapid person-to-person transmission and the role of the environment as potential reservoir. Despite the absence of large antibiotic resistance and virulence traits, MSSA ST398 can lead to severe infections in critically ill patients.

2863,maybe,butin2016,article,"Nosocomial late-onset sepsis represents a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality in preterm neonates. The Staphylococcus capitis clone NRCS-A has been previously described as an emerging cause of nosocomial bacteraemia in French neonatal intensive-care units (NICUs). In this study, we aimed to explore the possible unrecognized dissemination of this clone on a larger geographical scale. One hundred methicillin-resistant S. capitis strains isolated from neonates (n = 86) and adult patients (n = 14) between 2000 and 2013 in four different countries (France, Belgium, the UK, and Australia) were analysed with SmaI pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and dru typing. The vast majority of NICU strains showed the NRCS-A pulsotype and the dt11c type (96{\%}). We then randomly selected 14 isolates (from neonates, n = 12, three per country; from adult patients, n = 2), considered to be a subset of representative isolates, and performed further molecular typing (SacII PFGE, SCCmec typing, and multilocus sequence typing-like analysis), confirming the clonality of the S. capitis strains isolated from neonates, despite their distant geographical origin. Whole genome single-nucleotide polymorphism-based phylogenetic analysis of five NICU isolates (from the different countries) attested to high genetic relatedness within the NRCS-A clone. Finally, all of the NRCS-A strains showed multidrug resistance (e.g. methicillin and aminoglycoside resistance, and decreased vancomycin susceptibility), with potential therapeutic implications for infected neonates. In conclusion, this study represents the first report of clonal dissemination of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus clone on a large geographical scale.

In Mexico, some reports inform prevalence as high as 50{\%} of the isolations. S. penumoniae is a germ that produces a wide variety of diseases, although the most serious infections are in respiratory tract and meningitis. Most patients with the infection caused by this microorganism have a good response to the treatment. The cases with bad prognosis and those which are eventually lethal are related to host factors and microbiologic characteristics such as resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. The aim of this paper is to inform on three cases of fulminant meningitis due to S. pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, which presented neurological focalization, acute loss of consciousness, coma, and death within the first week, in spite of treatment with cephalosporin of third and fourth generation. In all these cases, S. pneumoniae was isolated from cerebrospinal fluid. The presence of similar cases should alert the clinician to consider an early diagnosis of penicillin resistant meningitis in order to establish an appropriate antibiotic therapy, and consequently, modify the prognosis of the patients.",L K Carmona-Furusho and C R Ariza-Andraca and F Iniestra-Flores and G Soto-Hernandez,"0443-5117 (print)

The increase in meningitis caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii has resulted in a significant reduction in available treatment options. CASE REPORT AND LITERATURE REVIEW: We report the case of a 36-year-old man with a complex craniofacial trauma, who developed a nosocomial meningitis due to MDR A. baumannii that was cured by intrathecal colistin. The case is contextualized among all the published cases of Acinetobacter meningitis treated with topical colistin found through a MEDLINE search of the literature. To date, including the present case, eight reported cases of Acinetobacter meningitis have been treated with colistin administered by an intrathecal route and 24 by an intraventricular route. The daily dose of colistin used ranged from 1.6 mg every 24 h to 20 mg every 24 h in adult patients. The median time necessary to obtain cerebrospinal fluid sterilization was 4.1 days, and treatment was always successful even if in two cases Acinetobacter meningitis relapsed. Toxicity probably or possibly related to the topical administration of colistin was noted in five out of the 32 patients.

In addition, there is a lack of information pertaining to resistance to macrolide, lincosamide and streptogramin type B (MLS(B)) in developing countries, including Mexico. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of resistance to MLS(B) antibiotics in isolates of S. epidermidis obtained in the General Hospital of Acapulco in Mexico. Susceptibility to erythromycin, clindamycin and quinupristin-dalfopristin was tested by a diffusion test, and MICs to oxacillin, erythromycin and lincomycin were determined. Differentiation between MLS(B) phenotypes was performed by a double disc diffusion test. A total of 38 of the 47 strains of S. epidermidis isolated from nosocomial infections were resistant to oxacillin [meticillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE)]. The phenotypes obtained were: 18 constitutive MLS(B), 3 inducible MLS(B), 6 macrolide streptogramin and 4 lincosamide; 7 strains were susceptible to MLS(B) antibiotics. The genes associated with resistance were detected by PCR. Genotyping showed a predominance of the ermA gene followed by genes ermC and msrA. The frequency of the genes detected varied slightly from results that have been reported in isolates from other countries. Clonal types were identified by PFGE and revealed the dissemination of two major clones of MRSE in the Mexican hospital. This is believed to be the first report in Mexico on the genes associated with the MLS(B) resistance phenotype in S. epidermidis, in addition to observing a wide distribution of clonal types in the General Hospital of Acapulco, Mexico.",N Castro-Alarcon and R M Ribas-Aparicio and J Silva-Sanchez and A Calderon-Navarro and A Sanchez-Perez and I Parra-Rojas and G Aparicio-Ozores,0022-2615,J Med Microbiol,"*Drug Resistance, Bacterial,Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology,Bacterial Typing Techniques,Cluster Analysis,Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field,Genes, Bacterial,Hospitals,Humans,Lincosamides/*pharmacology,Macrolides/*pharmacology,Mexico,Microbial Sensitivity Tests/methods,Molecular Typing,Staphylococcus epidermidis/*drug effects/*genetics,Streptogramins/*pharmacology",730--736,"{Molecular typing and characterization of macrolide, lincosamide and streptogramin resistance in Staphylococcus epidermidis strains isolated in a Mexican hospital}",NA,60,2011,pt 6,"1473-5644

METHODS: Resistance genes erm(B) and mef(A) were searched for by PCR. Portions of genes for domains V and II of the 23S rRNA (rrl) and genes for ribosomal proteins L4 (rplD) and L22 (rplV) were amplified by PCR from total genomic DNA and sequenced. RESULTS: Resistance genes erm(B) and mef(A) were not detected. Only mutation in the rplV gene encoding ribosomal protein L22 was detected. The strain contained a six amino acid insertion ((107)KRTAHI(108)) in the C-terminus of the ribosomal protein L22.

DESIGN: We examined genotypic drug resistance patterns using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and the degree of molecular clustering using 24-locus mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units-variable number of tandem repeats (MIRU-VNTR) among 199 consecutive pulmonary TB patients in Jayapura, Papua. RESULTS: Drug resistance mutations were present in 30/198 (15.2{\%}) patients: 16/144 (11.1{\%}) primary cases and 14/51 (27.5{\%}) retreatment cases. Genotypic resistance to rifampicin was found in 15 (7.6{\%}) patients, to isoniazid in 19 (9.6{\%}), to ethambutol in 7 (3.5{\%}), and to streptomycin and second-line injectable drugs in 5 (2.5{\%}) patients. Eight (4.0{\%}) patients had multidrug-resistant TB, while no mutations were found for fluoroquinolones. The most common lineage found among all isolates was East-African Indian (n = 66, 33.7{\%}), followed by Euro-American (n = 38, 19.4{\%}). Drug resistance mutations were more common among Beijing strains than other lineages. Of the 30 drug-resistant isolates, 12 (40.0{\%}) fell into four clusters that were separate from drug-susceptible clusters as determined using MIRU-VNTR.

Aims: The aim of this study was to characterize pAmpC $\beta$-lactamase producing extraintestinal E. coli, their phylogenetic distribution, resistance pattern, treatment options, and impact on patient's clinical outcome. Settings and Design: This descriptive study was carried out in a multi-specialty tertiary care hospital. Materials and Methods: A total of 300 clinically significant, non-repeat isolates were studied. AmpC disk test was used for phenotypic AmpC-$\beta$-lactamase detection. Molecular types of pAmpC were determined by a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Phylogenetic analysis was performed by triplex PCR methods. Metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) detection was done by E test. Antibiogram, treatment, and clinical outcome were collected in a structured proforma. Results: Although 95 isolates (32{\%}) were phenotypically positive for AmpC, PCR detected CIT type of AmpC gene in only 37 isolates. Majority of strains were from phylogroup A (85{\%}) and B1 (58{\%}) which are considered as commensal groups. Co-production of ESBL's was observed in 33 strains and 5 strains were found to be MBL producers. Most widely prescribed antibiotics were 3 rd generation cephalosporins (30{\%}), carbapenems (19{\%}) and aminoglycosides (16{\%}). Conclusions: Plasmid mediated AmpC producing isolates were found to exhibit a high degree of drug resistance, and they mainly belonged to commensal strains possibly due to misuse of antibiotics. Proper antibiotic policy is required to limit the spread of pAmpC producers or else it will lead to a therapeutic dead end in the near future.",A Chakraborty and P Adhikari and S Shenoy and V Saralaya,"0974-5130

Clavulanic acid decreased the MICs of ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone, which suggested that LBT04 produced an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. These resistances were carried by a 1080-bp chromosomal gene that encoded a beta-lactamase with a pI of 6.3.

The objective of this work is to summarize the current incidence and spectrum of carbapenemase producers in the Czech Republic. Methods: All blood isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been sent to the National Reference Laboratory for Antibiotics since 2005 for the purpose of EARS-Net survey. Moreover, Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter baumannii isolates resistant to meropenem or imipenem according to the CLSI or EUCAST criteria were sent to the NRL for Antibiotics and/or to the Pilsen laboratory for confirmation of resistance to carbapenems. The approximation disk test was used to detect MBLs, KPCs and AmpC enzymes. Carbapenemase activity was formerly confirmed by imipenem spectrophotometric hydrolysis assay and recently by MALDI-TOF MS hydrolysis assay. Identification of carbapenemase was performed by PCR followed by amplicon sequencing. MLST was performed in Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii isolates. Results: The most of the analysed isolates were resistant to the carbapenems due to the porin mechanism. Carbapenemase production has been confirmed in minority of the cases. The KPC-2 carbapenemase was firstly detected in K. pneumoniae (ST258) isolated from a patient repatriated from Greece, followed by KPC-3- producing K. pneumoniae (ST515) from a patient previously hospitalized in Italy. VIM-1 metallo-beta-lactamase was detected in two strains of Serratia marcescens isolated independently in two hospitals and also in K. pneumoniae isolates. VIM-1-producing K. pneumoniae has been responsible for local outbreaks in one hospital in Prague. In spring 2011, the first NDM-1 producer was observed in the Czech Republic. NDM-1 was detected in Acinetobacter baumannii (ST1) isolated from a patient repatriated from Hurghada, Egypt. Metallo-beta-lactamase-producing P. aeruginosa isolates (VIM-2, IMP-7) have been detected in at least seven hospitals causing local outbreaks. Conclusions: Although the incidence has been mostly sporadic in the Czech Republic, the outbreak potential of these isolates has already been shown.

4092,maybe,cohen2015b,article,"BACKGROUND: The continued advance of antibiotic resistance threatens the treatment and control of many infectious diseases. This is exemplified by the largest global outbreak of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB) identified in Tugela Ferry, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, in 2005 that continues today. It is unclear whether the emergence of XDR-TB in KwaZulu-Natal was due to recent inadequacies in TB control in conjunction with HIV or other factors. Understanding the origins of drug resistance in this fatal outbreak of XDR will inform the control and prevention of drug-resistant TB in other settings. In this study, we used whole genome sequencing and dating analysis to determine if XDR-TB had emerged recently or had ancient antecedents. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We performed whole genome sequencing and drug susceptibility testing on 337 clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis collected in KwaZulu-Natal from 2008 to 2013, in addition to three historical isolates, collected from patients in the same province and including an isolate from the 2005 Tugela Ferry XDR outbreak, a multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolate from 1994, and a pansusceptible isolate from 1995. We utilized an array of whole genome comparative techniques to assess the relatedness among strains, to establish the order of acquisition of drug resistance mutations, including the timing of acquisitions leading to XDR-TB in the LAM4 spoligotype, and to calculate the number of independent evolutionary emergences of MDR and XDR. Our sequencing and analysis revealed a 50-member clone of XDR M. tuberculosis that was highly related to the Tugela Ferry XDR outbreak strain. We estimated that mutations conferring isoniazid and streptomycin resistance in this clone were acquired 50 y prior to the Tugela Ferry outbreak (katG S315T [isoniazid]; gidB 130 bp deletion [streptomycin]; 1957 [95{\%} highest posterior density (HPD): 1937-1971]), with the subsequent emergence of MDR and XDR occurring 20 y (rpoB L452P [rifampicin]; pncA 1 bp insertion [pyrazinamide]; 1984 [95{\%} HPD: 1974-1992]) and 10 y (rpoB D435G [rifampicin]; rrs 1400 [kanamycin]; gyrA A90V [ofloxacin]; 1995 [95{\%} HPD: 1988-1999]) prior to the outbreak, respectively. We observed frequent de novo evolution of MDR and XDR, with 56 and nine independent evolutionary events, respectively. Isoniazid resistance evolved before rifampicin resistance 46 times, whereas rifampicin resistance evolved prior to isoniazid only twice. We identified additional putative compensatory mutations to rifampicin in this dataset. One major limitation of this study is that the conclusions with respect to ordering and timing of acquisition of mutations may not represent universal patterns of drug resistance emergence in other areas of the globe. CONCLUSIONS: In the first whole genome-based analysis of the emergence of drug resistance among clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis, we show that the ancestral precursor of the LAM4 XDR outbreak strain in Tugela Ferry gained mutations to first-line drugs at the beginning of the antibiotic era. Subsequent accumulation of stepwise resistance mutations, occurring over decades and prior to the explosion of HIV in this region, yielded MDR and XDR, permitting the emergence of compensatory mutations. Our results suggest that drug-resistant strains circulating today reflect not only vulnerabilities of current TB control efforts but also those that date back 50 y. In drug-resistant TB, isoniazid resistance was overwhelmingly the initial resistance mutation to be acquired, which would not be detected by current rapid molecular diagnostics employed in South Africa that assess only rifampicin resistance.",K A Cohen and T Abeel and A {Manson McGuire} and C A Desjardins and V Munsamy and T P Shea and B J Walker and N Bantubani and D V Almeida and L Alvarado and S B Chapman and N R Mvelase and E Y Duffy and M G Fitzgerald and P Govender and S Gujja and S Hamilton and C Howarth and J D Larimer and K Maharaj and M D Pearson and M E Priest and Q Zeng and N Padayatchi and J Grosset and S K Young and J Wortman and K P Mlisana and M R O'Donnell and B W Birren and W R Bishai and A S Pym and A M Earl,1549-1277,PLoS Med,"*Genome, Bacterial,Adult,Antitubercular Agents/*pharmacology,Disease Outbreaks,Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis/drug thera,Female,Humans,Male,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Mutation,Mycobacterium tuberculosis/drug effects/*genetics/,Sequence Analysis, DNA,South Africa/epidemiology",e1001880,{Evolution of Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis over Four Decades: Whole Genome Sequencing and Dating Analysis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Isolates from KwaZulu-Natal},NA,12,2015,9,"1549-1676

4122,maybe,cole2013b,article,"OBJECTIVES: After a trend of increasing incidence of gonorrhoea in the 1990s, by 2004 the incidence was declining in England, but continuing to increase in Wales. This prompted an investigation of the epidemiology of gonorrhoea in Wales to inform future prevention and control measures. METHODS: As an extension to Gonococcal Resistance to Antimicrobials Surveillance Programme, between May 2005 and September 2006, 540 consecutive gonococcal isolates were collected from three microbiology laboratories in South Wales. Isolates were typed using Neisseria gonorrhoeae Multi Antigen Sequence Typing tested for susceptibility to therapeutic agents and demographic and behavioural data were collected retrospectively from patient notes. RESULTS: 163 sequence types (STs) were identified in 475 N gonorrhoeae isolates from 502 patient episodes. The most frequently observed STs ({\textgreater}20 isolates) were: 2, 752, 471, 249 and 8, all of which were susceptible to the antimicrobial agents tested. A significant association between ST and sexual orientation was identified, the most frequently observed STs occurring in young (median age {\textless}25 years) heterosexuals. STs 147, 4, 1634 and 64 predominated in men who have sex with men. CONCLUSIONS: We confirm the existence of common STs across the UK, as well as identify a number of types that were novel to Wales. Discrete sexual networks were identified, the most localised being in young heterosexuals. Molecular typing provides a method for identifying local clusters of gonorrhoea, and could assist in the implementation and evaluation of targeted interventions.",M J Cole and D Rh Thomas and S A Chisholm and A N Abdullah and H Birley and I Hosein and E Kubiak and D White and I Martin and C A Ison,"1368-4973

A case-control study was subsequently designed to identify risk factors associated with the development of infections due to these organisms. All VREG isolates were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing, vancomycin resistance gene detection and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) typing. Additionally, the presence of genes associated with an acquired pathogenicity island of E. faecalis and a hyl-like gene of E. faecium was assessed by hybridisation assays. Eleven cases of VREG were identified between May through June 2004. VREG was isolated from blood (N = 4), surgical secretions (N = 4), paranasal sinus secretion (N = 1), lung abscess (N = 1) and urine (N = 1). Infections with VREG were associated with mucositis, hospitalisation in the haematology ward and surgical unit, length of hospital stay prior to culture and invasive procedures within 30 days prior to the culture. Logistic regression found that female sex and hospitalisation in the surgical unit were independent factors for VREG infection.

4383,yes,cremet2013,article,"Objectives: This study reports details on Escherichia coli isolates recovered from a cystic fibrosis (CF) patient in order to understand how this pathogen adapts to and resists broad-spectrum antipseudomonal therapy in this context. Methods: Five E. coli isolates were obtained from various clinical samples (airways, urine or dialysis catheter) over a 7 month period covering a double-lung transplantation. All isolates were analysed in terms of clonality [enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC)-PCR and multilocus sequence typing], virulence profiles (phylogroup and search for 15 virulence genes), growth patterns (morphotype, biofilm-forming ability and growth rate), hypermutability and antimicrobial susceptibility, with molecular characterization of $\beta$-lactamases and porins. Results: The five isolates shared similar ERIC-PCR profiles and sequence types (ST1193) and exhibited the same virulence profile. The respiratory isolates were strong mutators, exhibited mucoid or small-colony morphotypes, exhibited strong biofilm-forming ability and grew slowly compared with the others. All isolates were highly resistant to ceftazidime. The respiratory isolates showed reduced susceptibility to cefepime and high resistance to aztreonam. The patient had received a 31 day course of ceftazidime/aztreonam until transplantation. All isolates harboured the same wild-type chromosomal AmpC. A CMY-2 enzyme was detected in the non-respiratory isolates. The respiratory isolates harboured L293S and V211A/L293S new CMY-2 variants, which were designated CMY-94 and CMY-95, respectively. OmpF porin loss was observed in the non-respiratory isolates. Conclusions: Our study shows that, similarly to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, E. coli can undergo phenotypic and genomic changes in the CF context. For the first time, we identified an in vivo expanded-spectrum evolution of the CMY-2 $\beta$-lactamase, during bacterial persistence in the CF lung. {\textcopyright} The Author 2013.

4641,yes,daoud2008,article,"INTRODUCTION: A 58 year-old man was admitted to the Saint Joseph Hospital-Raymond and Aida Najjar polyclinic in Beirut on July 17, 2007 to undergo surgery for a moderately differentiated colonic adenocarcinoma (T3N0). Following several discharges and re-admissions, an extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Escherichia coli susceptible to imipenem was isolated. The patient was put on imipenem and metronidazole. Three weeks later, imipenem (IMP) resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae was isolated. METHODS AND RESULTS: The antimicrobial susceptibility profile of the imipenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae strain and related minimum inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics were determined. Hydrolysis of IMP was evaluated and production of metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) was detected by a double disk-synergy test, ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) inhibited the imipenemase activity, whereas clavulanate and tazobactam did not, this suggesting the production of a metallo-beta-lactamase. Isoelectric focusing analysis was performed and indicated the presence of a cefotaximase (blaCTX-M-15). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used and detected the presence of blaIMP-1 and blaCTX-M genes. CONCLUSIONS: During the last decade, many hospital outbreaks caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae spp. have been reported in Lebanon.

4821,maybe,dematos2016,article,"Introduction: The spread of multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Brazilian hospitals has greatly impacted upon the morbidity and mortality of individuals in intensive care units. Given the lack of information regarding the dynamics of multidrug resistance in northern Brazil, we analyzed the clinical and microbiological features of nosocomial infections caused by P. aeruginosa. Methods: Between January 2010 and March 2012, we conducted a retrospective cohort study of P. aeruginosa isolates from 54 patients who were hospitalized in intensive care units. The clinical and epidemiologic variables were analyzed, including the patients' demographic data and comorbidities, and the lengths of the intensive care unit stays, the classification of the infections as nosocomial, the use of invasive procedures, antimicrobial therapy, and the patients' outcomes. We undertook susceptibility tests, molecular detection of the metallo-$\beta$-lactamase genes, and genotypic analyses of the isolates using the repetitive element-polymerase chain reaction. Results: Multidrug resistance occurred most frequently among isolates from adults who had been hospitalized for an average of 87.1 days. The use of mechanical ventilation and urinary catheters were risk factors for infection. The four isolates that harbored the blaSPM-1-like gene showed {\textgreater}95{\%} genetic similarity. Conclusions: This study's findings show that P. aeruginosa has a high death rate, and that inadequate treatment and invasive procedures are risk factors for infection. This is the first report describing the detection of the blaSPM-1-like gene in northern Brazil.

4841,yes,deoliveira2014,article,"Background: Reports of nosocomial infection due to carbapenem resistant Serratia spp. have become significantly more common. This resistance may be due to production of distinct carbapenemases, such as KPC [1,2]. This enzyme, initially described in Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, has also been detected among other organisms, such as Serratia marcescens, emphasizing the global risk of interspecies spread of resistance genes [2,3]. The aim of this study was to identify carbapenemase genes in Serratia spp. Isolated of nosocomial infection. Methods: The samples were collected during May/2012 to May/2013. The strains were recovered from urinary tract, tracheal aspirate and blood culture from patients hospitalized Dourados/MS hospital. The identification of Serratia spp. and the sensitivity test was carried out using a Vitek (BioM{\'{e}}rieux) automated system. All strains with reduced susceptibility to imipenem or meropenem were screened for carbapenemase production by the modified Hodge test as recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute [4]. The presence of KPC coding gene was assessed by PCR as described by Cuzon et al. (2010) [5]. Results and conclusions: From May/2012 to May/2013, fifty strains of Serratia spp. were isolated. The wards that had the highest incidence of Serratia spp. were the intensive care units (ICUs). The strains identified as producing carbapenemases were evaluated by PCR using primers specific for blaKPC gene. Fourteen Serratia spp. strains were positive in PCR. This work describes the first report of KPC gene in Serratia spp. isolates in Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil and confirm the high level of resistance of Serratia spp. against carbapenemics. The clinical importance of detecting carbapenemases producing Serratia spp. is to contribute to hospital infection control, reducing the spread of multidrug-resistant microorganisms and providing results that help in choosing the most appropriate antimicrobial, prolonging patient survival.",P M R {De Oliveira} and W G Maciel and J L {Dos Santos Cunha E Silva} and K E {Da Silva} and M E Correa and N G Vasconcelos and F P C Sacchi and M T R {Da Costa Garcia Croda} and F J NegrÃ£o and J H R Croda and S Simionatto,1753-6561,BMC Proceedings,"Brazil,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Serratia,Serratia marcescens,antiinfective agent,biotechnology,blood culture,carbapenem,carbapenemase,enzyme,gene,hospital,hospital infection,human,imipenem,infection control,intensive care unit,laboratory,meropenem,microorganism,patient,risk,society,survival,tracheal aspiration procedure,urinary tract,ward",NA,{Identification of carbapenemase genes in Serratia spp},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l71665302 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=17536561{\&}id=doi:{\&}atitle=identification+of+carbapenemase+genes+in+serratia+spp{\&}stitle=bmc+proc.{\&}title=bmc+proce,8,2014,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,yes,brooke,no,ayomide,zach,zach,yes,zm_6.csv,NA,NA,zm_6_1.mex,yes,journal

We review drug resistance in N. gonorrhoeae with a particular emphasis on resistance to fluoroquinolones, cefixime and azithromycin. Materials and Methods: Literature selected from peer reviewed journals listed in MEDLINE{\textregistered}/PubMed{\textregistered} from 1943 to 2009 and from resources cited in those articles was reviewed comprehensively. Results: Due to the spread of fluoroquinolone resistant N. gonorrhoeae fluoroquinolones are no longer recommended for the treatment of gonorrhea. The emergence of N. gonorrhoeae with a mosaic penicillin-binding protein 2 associated with oral cephalosporin resistance has threatened cefixime treatment for gonorrhea. Emergence of N. gonorrhoeae with high level resistance to azithromycin has also been documented. However, injectable antibiotics (sepctinomycin and ceftriaxone) retain their activity against N. gonorrhoeae. To monitor drug resistance in N. gonorrhoeae several national and international programs have become functional. Conclusions: Oral regimens for the treatment of gonorrhea are limited. At present to our knowledge ceftriaxone is the most reliable and available agent for the treatment of gonorrhea. To prevent the further emergence and international spread of drug resistance, and allow for the selection of appropriate treatments, a comprehensive global program is needed including surveillance for drug resistance in N. gonorrhoeae and collection of patient epidemiological data. Clinicians should effectively treat patients with gonorrhea, always being conscious of local trends of drug resistance in N. gonorrhoeae, and should perform culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing in those with persistent gonorrhea after treatment. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.",T Deguchi and K Nakane and M Yasuda and S I Maeda,0022-5347,Journal of Urology,"Medline,Neisseria gonorrhoeae,antibiotic resistance,antibiotic sensitivity,antimicrobial activity,article,azithromycin,bacterial strain,cefdinir,cefixime,cefodizime,ceftibuten,ceftriaxone,cephalosporin,chlamydiasis,ciprofloxacin,dose response,drug blood level,drug formulation,drug megadose,drug monitoring,drug tolerability,enoxacin,gastrointestinal symptom,gonococcal urethritis,gonorrhea,homosexual male,human,levofloxacin,minimum inhibitory concentration,ofloxacin,penicillin G,penicillin binding protein 2a,priority journal,quinoline derived antiinfective agent,single drug dose,spectinomycin,tetracycline,treatment failure",851--858,{Emergence and spread of drug resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l50997064 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.juro.2010.04.078 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=00225347{\&}id=doi:10.1016{\%}2fj.juro.2010.04.078{\&}atitle=emergence+and,184,2010,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,yes,brooke,maybe,mushtaq,mushtaq,zach,yes,zm_6.csv,NA,NA,zm_6_1.mex,yes,journal

METHODS: A total of 1453 bacterial strains were isolated from patients with hematological disease from January 2005 to December 2011. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by micro-dilution method. RESULTS: (1) The majority of the bacterial strains were respiratory passage examples (57.5{\%}). The portage of blood examples in our division (13.60{\%}) was higher than of whole hospital (6.26{\%}), with lower positive rate of bacterial culture (52.37{\%}) than of whole hospital (60.24{\%}). Chemotherapy-induced agranulocytosis was the main reason for hospital infection. 578 (39.8{\%}) bacterial strains were gram positive, and 875 (60.2{\%}) gram negative bacillus. Staphylococcus epidermidis strains and glucose nonfermenters had a tendency of ascensus. (2) Methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) accounted for 72.8{\%} antibiotic resistance. Detection rates of ESBLs in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were 18.9{\%} and 10.4{\%}, respectively. (3) No obvious changes of antimicrobial resistances of Staphylococcus and Enterococcus were observed during these years. The Enterobacteriaceae strains showed lowest resistance rates to Carbapenems, next to Cefoperazone/sulbactam and Piperacillin/tazobactam. But the resistance rates of Escherichia coli to Cefepime and Ceftazidime were gradually increasing during the past years. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii of glucose nonfermenters showed lowest resistance rates to Cefoperazone/sulbactam, but the resistance rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to Carbapenems increased. CONCLUSIONS: Escherichia coli was the highest in quantity of gram negative bacillus and glucose nonfermenters had a tendency of ascensus. The resistance rates of Escherichia coli to Cefepime and Ceftazidime, Pseudomonas aeruginosa to Carbapenems were gradually increasing in the past years.",Q Deng and Q Li and X M Lin and Y M Li,"0253-2727 (print)

5362,maybe,dolejska2012a,article,"In this study, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates in children with malignancies hospitalised at a paediatric oncology department in the Czech Republic were investigated. From June 2009 to January 2010, a total of 50 ESBL-producing faecal isolates of Enterobacteriaceae were obtained from 28 patients. These isolates were characterised with regard to ESBL enzymes, plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and plasmids conferring resistance to cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones. ESBL-producing isolates included Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=36), Escherichia coli (n=7), Klebsiella oxytoca (n=3), Enterobacter cloacae (n=2) and Citrobacter freundii (n=2). Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates belonged to 7 MLST types, including sequence types ST280, ST321, ST323 and ST416 as well as the novel types ST626, ST627 and ST628. The multiresistant epidemic clone E. coli B2-O25b-ST131 was detected in one patient. The gene bla(CTX-M-15) was found on large conjugative IncFII(K) plasmids along with bla(TEM-1), bla(OXA-1), qnrB1, aac(6')-Ib-cr, strA, sul2, aac(3')-II and tet(A) genes in most isolates. Dissemination of IncFII(K) plasmids among various Enterobacteriaceae isolates was considered an important aspect of nosocomial colonisation in the wards by Enterobacteriaceae species producing ESBLs. This is the first study documenting multiple antibiotic resistance elements, including qnr genes, in IncFII(K) plasmids in various bacterial species isolated in a single hospital department. The results highlight the evolution of IncFII(K) plasmids into new variants containing novel antibiotic resistance elements and their important role in spreading ESBL-producing bacteria among hospitalised patients.",M Dolejska and E Brhelova and H Dobiasova and J Krivdova and J Jurankova and A Sevcikova and L Dubska and I Literak and A Cizek and M Vavrina and L Kutnikova and J Sterba,"0924-8579

5415,yes,doosti2013,article,"BACKGROUND: Infectious by Pseudomonas aeruginosa has spread worldwide and metallo-beta-lactamases (MBL) are being reported with increasing frequency. The aim of this study was to investigate the antibiotic susceptibility and distribution of blaVIM and blaIMP genes in P. aeruginosa isolates from Zanjan Province of Iran. METHODS: A total of 70 P. aeruginosa isolates were identified from patients admitted at intensive care units. The antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by disk diffusion (Kirby-Bauer) method and for production of MBL using double-disk synergy test (DDST). After DNA extraction, the presence of blaVIM and blaIMP genes and class 1 integron were detected by PCR. RESULTS: Most of the isolates were resistant to meropenem, cefotaxime and imipenem (IPM). Also, 44/70 (62.85{\%}) IPM resistant isolates were confirmed by DDST. Of the 44 clinical isolates, 41 (93{\%}) isolates showed MIC{\textgreater}/=4 microg/ml for IPM. Based on the DDST results, 36 (87.8{\%}) were confirmed to be MBL producers. PCR amplification showed that 23/41 (56{\%}) carried blaVIM and 10/41 (24.3{\%}) possessed blaIMP gene. Also, 31/44 (70.5{\%}) isolates contained class 1 integron gene. CONCLUSION: Our results highlight that the genes for Verona integron-encoded metallo-beta-lactamase, IPM beta-lactamases and class 1 integrons were predominantly present among the IPM-resistant P. aeruginosa tested in our province and also the frequency of blaVIM type is higher than blaIMP.

5880,maybe,endimiani2009,article,"Objectives: To characterize isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae producing KPC carbapenemase (KPC-Kp) associated with an outbreak in a long-term acute care hospital (LTACH) in South Florida. Methods: During 21 March to 20 April 2008, 241 K. pneumoniae isolates detected at Integrated Regional Laboratories (Ft. Lauderdale, FL) for which the ertapenem MICs were â¥4 mg/L were studied. PCR, cloning and sequence analysis were used to detect blaKPC and to characterize the $\beta$-lactamase and outer membrane proteins (Omps). The expression level of KPC enzymes was studied by immunoblotting. Genetic relatedness of isolates was investigated with rep-PCR and PFGE. Clinical records of patients were investigated. Results: Seven KPC-Kp strains were isolated from different patients located at a single LTACH, with a further three isolates being recovered from patients at different hospitals. All KPC-Kp isolates in patients from the LTACH and from one hospital patient were genetically related and shared PFGE patterns that clustered with known sequence type (ST) 258 strains. These strains were highly resistant to carbapenems (MICs â¥ 32 mg/L) due to an increased level of KPC expression and loss of Omps. Rectal colonization was documented in all LTACH patients with KPC-Kp isolates. Treatment failures were common (crude mortality rate of 69{\%}). Active surveillance and enhanced infection control practices terminated the KPC-Kp outbreak. Conclusions: The detection of KPC-Kp in an LTACH represents a serious infection control and therapeutic challenge in a new clinical setting. The speed at which the epidemic of KPC-Kp is spreading in our healthcare system mandates urgent action. {\textcopyright} The Author 2009.

Several factors such as the period of hospital staying after surgery, base disease, age, immune system condition, hygiene policies, careless prophylactic drug administration and physical conditions of the healthcare centre may contribute to the acquisition of a nosocomial infection. A purulent wound can become complicated whenever antimicrobial therapy becomes compromised. In this pilot study, we analysed Enterobacteriaceae strains, the most significant gram-negative rods that may occur in post-surgical skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) presenting reduced beta-lactam susceptibility and those presenting extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL). There is little information in our country regarding the relationship between beta-lactam susceptibility, ESBL and development of resistant strains of microorganisms in SSTI. Our main results indicate Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. are among the most frequent enterobacteria (46{\%} and 30{\%} respectively) with ESBL production in 72{\%} of Enterobacteriaceae isolates from SSTI. Moreover, coinfection occurred extensively, mainly with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (18{\%} and 13{\%}, respectively). These results suggest future research to explore if and how these associations are involved in the development of antibiotic resistance.",R Fernandes and C Prudencio,1742-4801,Int Wound J,"Communicable Diseases, Emerging/epidemiology/micro,Cross Infection/epidemiology/*microbiology,DNA Fingerprinting,DNA, Bacterial/analysis/genetics,Enterobacteriaceae Infections/epidemiology/*microb,Enterobacteriaceae/*genetics/isolation {\&} purificat,Female,Humans,Infection Control,Male,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Middle Aged,Molecular Epidemiology,Pilot Projects,Population Surveillance,Portugal/epidemiology,Risk Factors,Surgical Wound Infection/epidemiology/*microbiolog,beta-Lactam Resistance/*genetics,beta-Lactamases/genetics",508--514,{Post-surgical wound infections involving Enterobacteriaceae with reduced susceptibility to beta-lactams in two Portuguese hospitals},NA,7,2010,6,"1742-481x

6314,maybe,fernandez2011,article,"Between February 2006 and October 2009, 38 patients in different wards at the A Coru{\~{n}}a University Hospital (northwest Spain) were either infected with or colonized by an epidemic, multidrug-resistant (MDR), and extended-spectrum-$\beta$-lactamase (ESBL)-producing strain of Enterobacter cloacae (EbSF), which was susceptible only to carbapenems. Semiautomated repetitive extragenic palindromic sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis revealed that all of the E. cloacae isolates belonged to the same clone. Cloning and sequencing enabled the detection of the SFO-1 ESBL in the epidemic strain and the description of its genetic environment. The presence of the ampR gene was detected upstream of blaSFO-1, and two complete sequences of IS26 surrounding ampR and ampA were detected. These IS26 sequences are bordered by complete left and right inverted repeats (IRL and IRR, respectively), which suggested that they were functional. The whole segment flanked by two IS26 copies may be considered a putative large composite transposon. A gene coding for aminoglycoside acetyltransferase (gentamicin resistance gene [aac3]) was found downstream of the 3â² IS26. Despite the implementation of strict infection control measures, strain EbSF spread through different areas of the hospital. A case-control study was performed to assess risk factors for EbSF acquisition. A multivariate analysis revealed that the prior administration of $\beta$-lactam antibiotics, chronic renal failure, tracheostomy, and prior hospitalization were statistically associated with SFO-1-producing E. cloacae acquisition. This study describes for the first time an outbreak in which an SFO-1-producing E. cloacae strain was involved. Note that so far, this $\beta$-lactamase has previously been isolated in only a single case of E. cloacae infection in Japan. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2011, American Society for Microbiology.

7267,yes,giani2011,article,"Objectives: Metallo $\beta$-lactamases (MBLs) are resistance determinants of great clinical relevance, given their ability to hydrolyze almost all $\beta$-lactams, including carbapenems. Among MBLs, NDM-1 is one of the most worrisome due to its propensity to rapid dissemination among Enterobacteriaceae. Here we report on the characterization of the first NDM-1 positive isolates from an Italian hospital. Methods: A total of 8 NDM-1-positive E. coli isolates obtained during 2009-2010 from stool and wound-exudate samples of two Italian patients were studied. Susceptibility testing were performed using Vitek2 system (Biomerieux). MICs of carbapenems, amikacin, piperacillin-tazobactam, colistin and tigecycline were confirmed by Etest (Biomerieux). Detection of resistance genes was performed using a custom microarray and all positive signals were confirmed by PCR. Clonality was investigated by PFGE and MLST. Localization of blaNDM-1 was investigated by Southern blot hybridizations. Gene transfer experiments were performed both by electroporation and conjugation. The genetic environment of blaNDM-1 was investigated by the inverse-PCR (iPCR) technique. Results: Isolates showed a MDR phenotype being not susceptible to all tested antibiotics, except colistin and, in 7 cases tigecycline. Carbapenem MICs were 4-8 mg/L (imipenem), 8-{\textgreater}32 mg/L (meropenem), 2-16 mg/L (doripenem), and {\textgreater}32 mg/L (ertapenem). Microarray, in conjunction with PCR and sequencing, revealed the presence in all isolates of blaNDM-1, blaTEM-1, blaOXA-1, blaOXA-9, blaCTXM- 15, tetA(B), tetA(C), armA, aac(6)-Ib-cr, aac(3)-II, catB3, and arr3 resistance determinants. PFGE and MLST demonstrated that isolates were clonally related and belonged to ST405. blaNDM-1 was not transferred either by electroporation or by conjugation using different E. coli recipients. iPCR experiments revealed an original genetic structure, characterized by an intact IS26 insertion sequence upstream blaNDM-1. Results from Southern-Blot experiments revealed the likely presence of 2 copies of blaNDM-1 in the investigated isolates, with one plasmid-encoded. Conclusions: Characterization of the genetic environment of the first NDM-1 positive Italian isolates revealed an original arrangement, underscoring the promiscuity of genetic elements carrying blaNDM-1. The presence of a plethora of different clinically relevant resistance determinants in such isolates is a worrisome finding given the scarce number of effective therapeutic options available.",T Giani and M M D'Andrea and F Arena and V Conte and C Venturelli and P Bresciani and F Rumpianesi and F Narni and G M Rossolini,1198-743x,Clinical Microbiology and Infection,"Enterobacteriaceae,Escherichia coli,Southern blotting,amikacin,antibiotic agent,carbapenem,carbapenem derivative,clonal variation,colistin,conjugation,doripenem,electroporation,environment,epsilometer test,ertapenem,gene,gene insertion sequence,gene transfer,genetic variability,hospital,human,hybridization,imipenem,inverse polymerase chain reaction,lactam,meropenem,patient,penicillinase,phenotype,piperacillin,plasmid,recipient,tazobactam,tigecycline,trientine,wound fluid",s138,{Characterisation of the first NDM-1 metallo $\beta$-lactamase producing escherichia coli isolates from an Italian hospital},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l70599318 http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-0691.2011.03558.x http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=1198743x{\&}id=doi:10.1111{\%}2fj.1469-0691.2011.03558.x{\&}atitle=c,17,2011,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,yes,brooke,no,mushtaq,allison,zach,no,zm_6.csv,could not find full-text,NA,NA,no,journal

7582,maybe,goto2013,article,"Introduction: Bacteroides fragilis , among the mostcommonanaerobic pathogens recovered from various infection sites, is resistant to a broader range of antimicrobials, compared with most other anaerobes. Approximately 2{\%} of B. fragilis clinical isolates are resistant to carbapenems, 20{\%} of these resistant strains show high level of resistance (MIC; 25-200 mg/ml) by producing a carbapenemase (CfiA), a metallo-$\beta$-lactamase. Although the cfiA gene is generally located on the B. fragilis chromosome,we previously identified for the first time a clinical isolate, the GAI92082 strain, in which CfiA is encoded by a mobilizable plasmid - pBFUK1. Objectives: In this study, we analyzed the complete nucleotide sequence of pBFUK1 and conducted the first distribution analysis of pBFUK1-like plasmids among carbapenem-resistant B. fragilis isolates. Methods:We sequenced pBFUK1 by inverse PCR and primer walking methods, providing an approximately 3.9-fold coverage across the length of pBFUK1. To investigate the distribution of pBFUK1-like plasmids, we extracted plasmids from 12 carbapenem-resistant B. fragilis strains isolated from patients in Japan from 1987 to 2006. Extracted plasmids were separated by an electrophoresis and were transferred to a nylon membrane, followed by the Southern blotting analysis to detect 7 genes on the pBFUK1 sequence. Results: The sequenced pBFUK1 plasmid consists of 12,817 nucleotides and encodes 16 putative open reading frames (ORFs). All ORFs showed 95-100{\%} amino-acid identity to known proteins identified in the genus Bacteroides . The pBFUK1 consists of a 4.3- kb backbone region, containing proteins related to plasmid replication, maintenance and mobilization, and a novel 8.5-kb composite transposon (designated Tn6186 ). The 3 mobilization proteins in pBFUK1 showed almost 100{\%} amino-acid identity to those in pLV22a plasmid from B. fragilis strain LV22. The Tn6186 transposon is flanked by 2 known insertion sequence elements (IS613 and IS615) and includes the cfiA gene and its putative promoter, and a small putative multidrug resistance protein gene. Nine of the 12 carbapenemresistant isolates possessed 1-3 plasmids. Southern blotting showed that the cfiA and transposase genes were only present on pBFUK1. Conclusion:We discovered a novel composite transposon, including the cfiA gene and its promoter, in the pBFUK1 sequence. Moreover, we found that CfiA-encoding pBFUK1-like plasmids were not widely distributed among carbapenem-resistant clinical isolates collected in Japan from 1987 to 2006. pBFUK1 may be mobilizable into other strains in the genus Bacteroides or other genus when co-residentwith a helper factor that carries genes encoding the systemformating pair formation.",T Goto and K Tanaka and C M Tran and K Watanabe,0924-8579,International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents,"Asia,Bacteroides,Bacteroides fragilis,Japan,Southern blotting,amino acid,anaerobe,antiinfective agent,carbapenem,carbapenem derivative,carbapenemase,chemotherapy,chromosome,electrophoresis,gene,gene insertion sequence,genus,helper factor,human,identity,infection,inverse polymerase chain reaction,membrane,microbiology,mobilization,multidrug resistance protein,nucleotide,nucleotide sequence,nylon,open reading frame,pathogenesis,patient,penicillinase,plasmid,promoter region,protein,transposase,transposon,walking",s53,"{Complete sequence of pBFUK1, a carbapenemase-harboring plasmid from Bacteroides fragilis, and distribution of pBFUK1-like plasmids}",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l71102727 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0924-8579(13)70282-6 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=09248579{\&}id=doi:10.1016{\%}2fs0924-8579{\%}2813{\%}2970282-6{\&}atitle=com,42,2013,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,maybe,cale,no,mushtaq,allison,zach,yes,zm_6.csv,NA,NA,zm_6_2.mex,yes,journal

7784,yes,gruber2013,article,"Introduction: Resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in clinically relevant Gram-negative species is mediated by different beta-lactamases, with metallo-beta-lactamases being among the most widespread carbapenemases worldwide. We report on a Yemeni patient, who presented at the University clinic in Frankfurt, Germany, and who was tested positive for a carbapenem-resistant E. coli. Carbapenem resistance was mediated by a new variant of the New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM). Material/Methods: Isolates were characterized by MIC testing and screened for carbapenemase, ESBL and AmpC resistance genes by PCR and subsequent sequencing. Horizontal gene transfer of blaNDM was analyzed in transconjugation experiments. Plasmid analysis was done by restriction fragment length polymorphism using BamHI, EcoRI and XHoI and PCR based replicon typing methods. The multidrug-resistant E. coli isolate was further characterized by MLST sequence typing. Molecular modelling was performed using the software tool Molecular Operating Environment. Results: E. coli isolates with an identical resistance pattern were collected from a Yemeni patient from different body sites including wounds, throat and rectum. MIC testing of the E. coli revealed resistance to all beta-lactam antibiotics including carbapenems. The beta-lactamase genes blaCMY-2, blaCTX-M-15 and blaTEM-1 were detected via PCR and sequence analysis. An identified blaNDM was found to differ from the known blaNDM-1 by two nucleotide mutations at position 388 (G{\`{a}}A) and 460 (A{\`{a}}C) corresponding to amino acid substitutions D130N and M154L, respectively. The new variant of NDM was identified as NDM-7. blaNDM-7 was shown to be located on an IncX3 type plasmid with a size of 60 kb. E. coli transformants harbouring NDM-7 showed higher MICs for beta-lactams including carbapenems compared to transformants harbouring NDM-1. MLST typing of the NDM-7 positive strain resulted in a new, yet undescribed sequence type (ST)-599 which showed closest relatedness to ST462 and ST463. Molecular modelling indicated that Leu154 in NDM-7 influences the flexibility of the binding pocket, thereby leading to lower substrate specificity and finally elevated carbapenem MICs. Discussion: This study identified a novel NDM-type beta-lactamase, NDM-7, possessing a high ability to hydrolyse carbapenems and cephalosporins. The occurrence of new NDM variants in Enterobacteriaceae is of great concern, especially in low-prevalence countries such as Germany. It further illustrates the rapid evolution of the NDM gene and the role of intercontinental travel and healthcare tourism in the global dissemination of multiresistant organisms. Since NDM-expressing Gram-negatives will most likely further disseminate and treatment options are very limited, rigorous screening and the prophylactic isolation of at-risk patients seem indispensable.",M Gruber and A Hamprecht and S Christ and D BÃ¼ttner and E Proschak and V A J Kempf and T A Wichelhaus and S GÃ¶ttig,1438-4221,International Journal of Medical Microbiology,"Enterobacteriaceae,Escherichia coli,Germany,amino acid substitution,beta lactam,beta lactam antibiotic,beta lactamase,carbapenem,carbapenem derivative,carbapenemase,cephalosporin derivative,environment,enzyme specificity,extended spectrum beta lactamase,gene,health care,horizontal gene transfer,hospital,human,hydrolysis,hygiene,metallo beta lactamase,microbiology,minimum inhibitory concentration,model,mutation,nucleotide,patient,plasmid,prevalence,rectum,replicon,restriction fragment length polymorphism,risk,screening,sequence analysis,society,software,species,throat,tourism,travel,university,wound",92,{First description of the New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase NDM-7 in Germany},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l71206651 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmm.2013.08.004 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=14384221{\&}id=doi:10.1016{\%}2fj.ijmm.2013.08.004{\&}atitle=first+descrip,303,2013,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,yes,cale,yes,erica,erica,zach,no,zm_6.csv,could not find full-text,NA,NA,no,journal

8298,yes,harris2016b,article,"INTRODUCTION: Over two million hospital-acquired (nosocomial) infections occur each year in the United States, and 50-60{\%} are caused by antimicrobial-resistant strains of bacteria. CASE PRESENTATION: A 67-year-old man presented to the ER with symptoms of confusion, lethargy and worsening somnolence. Medical history included carcinoma of the throat, atrial fibrillation, type-2 diabetes mellitus, COPD, and ischemic stroke. Heart rate, creatinine, WBC and lactate were elevated. Ultrasound revealed B lines and hepatization over the left lower lung. Abdominal CT scan confirmed a consolidative lung process (Figure 1) and revealed an impacted ureteral stone which was surgically treated. Blood and urine cultures were positive for Citrobacter koseri resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, susceptible to meropenem and variably susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam and ciprofloxacin. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a vegetative mitral valve mass supporting the diagnosis of bacterial (Citrobacter koseri) endocarditis (Figure 2). The patient responded favorably to a six-week course of IV antibiotics with meropenem. DISCUSSION: Important organisms that cause nosocomial infections include vancomycin-resistant Enterococci, methicillinresistant Staphylococci, and Gram-negative isolates with variable resistance patterns. Key Gram-negative resistance patterns arise from extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in enteric bacilli, high-level third-generation cephalosporin beta-lactamase resistance in Enterobacteriaceae and Citrobacter genus, and multidrug resistance in pseudomonads and Acinetobacter genus. Certain Citrobacter isolates, such as C. koseri, produce a small amount of beta-lactamase constitutively, while other Citrobacter species (such as C. amaloniticus) produce beta-lactamase which can mutate to high-level beta-lactamase resistance. Citrobacter causes endocarditis rarely, and only one report of C. koseri mitral valve endocarditis exists in the English language. Fourth-generation cephalosporins, piperacillin/tazobactam, and carbapenems are efficacious therapies for nosocomial infections caused by Gramnegative organisms with high beta-lactam resistance. CONCLUSIONS: The expanding epidemic of antibiotic resistant nosocomial infections has become a public health crisis.

These cases are the first known isolations of KPC-producing organisms in New Zealand. All four patients were transferred from, or had recently been in, hospitals in countries where KPC-producing organisms are prevalent (China, India, Greece and Italy). The bla KPC-2 gene was identified in the isolates from three patients and bla KPC-3 was identified in the isolate from the remaining patient. The isolates belonged to different multilocus sequence type clonal complexes, usually those prevalent in the country in which the patient had been previously hospitalised.

8632,maybe,hill2012a,article,"Objectives: We sought evidence for resistance to colistin amongst all isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae submitted to the national reference service from January to November 2011 and similarly reviewed all isolates collected in 2003 onwards. Methods: Clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae from patients throughout England were referred to the HPA reference service for evaluation. Patient details were collated and repeat specimens excluded. MICs of 27 antibiotics, including beta-lactams, aminoglycosides and colistin, were determined for each isolate by agar dilution (BSAC method). Current BSAC/EUCAST breakpoints for all antibiotics tested (e.g. MIC {\textgreater} 2 for colistin) were applied to isolates collected from 2003 to 2011 inclusive. Resistance mechanisms present in 2011 isolates were compared to those of the first colistin-resistant isolates within the 8 previous years (period 2003-2011). Results: There were 28 colistin-resistant K. pneumoniae from 29 patients in 19 hospitals during the first 10 months of 2011 compared to three isolates from three patients in two hospitals in 2004 and none in 2003. MICs of colistin were from 4 to {\textgreater}32 in 2011 but all were {\textgreater}32 in 2004. In 2011, there were 18 male (aged 4 weeks to 82 years) and 10 female (aged 18-83 years) patients. Nine isolates were from urine, five from wounds, four each from blood or faeces, two from line tips and one each from umbilicus, sputum or nose. Five patients were from one hospital and two different isolates from one patient in another hospital. Of the 28 isolates, 14 had an ESBL whilst 18 had a carbapenemase of which three were metallo-beta-lactamases (MBL) plus an ESBL. Nine were pan-aminoglycoside resistant and only seven had sensitivity to one aminoglycoside; due to beta-lactamase action + reduced permeability, only two were sensitive to ertapenem (MICs â¤ 0.5). Five were sensitive to tigecycline only and one was non-susceptible. One of the 2004 isolates had a ceftazidimase whilst the other two a CTX-M. In 2005 there were nine colistin-resistant isolates (MIC = 32) from six hospitals - two identical strains from one hospital and three from another; all had CTX-Ms and one an MBL. All isolates were pan-resistant to cephalosporins (cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefpirome; MICs 32 to {\textgreater}256). Conclusion: The first isolates of K. pneumonia resistant to colistin occurred in 2004, with an increase of almost ten times that in 2011. Isolates had one or more other significant resistance mechanism.

8709,maybe,hoa2011,article,"BACKGROUND: Streptococcus suis is an emerging zoonotic pathogen and is the leading cause of bacterial meningitis in adults in Vietnam. Systematic data on the antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of S. suis strains isolated from human cases are lacking. We studied antimicrobial resistance and associated resistance determinants in S. suis isolated from patients with meningitis in southern Vietnam. METHODS: S. suis strains isolated between 1997 and 2008 were investigated for their susceptibility to six antimicrobial agents. Strains were screened for the presence and expression of tetracycline and erythromycin resistance determinants and the association of tet(M) genes with Tn916- like transposons. The localization of tetracycline resistance gene tet(L) was determined by pulse field gel electrophoresis and Southern blotting. RESULTS: We observed a significant increase in resistance to tetracycline and chloramphenicol, which was concurrent with an increase in multi-drug resistance. In tetracycline resistance strains, we identified tet(M), tet(O), tet(W) and tet(L) and confirmed their expression. All tet(M) genes were associated with a Tn916-like transposon. The co-expression of tet(L) and other tetracycline resistance gene(s) encoding for ribosomal protection protein(s) was only detected in strains with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of tetracycline of {\textgreater}/= 64 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that multi-drug resistance in S. suis causing disease in humans in southern Vietnam has increased over the 11-year period studied. We report the presence and expression of tet(L) in S. suis strains and our data suggest that co-expression of multiple genes encoding distinct mechanism is required for an MIC {\textgreater}/= 64 mg/L to tetracycline.",N T Hoa and T T Chieu and H D Nghia and N T Mai and P H Anh and M Wolbers and S Baker and J I Campbell and N V Chau and T T Hien and J Farrar and C Schultsz,1471-2334,BMC Infect Dis,"*Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial,Adult,Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology,Bacterial Proteins/genetics,Female,Humans,Male,Meningitis, Bacterial/*microbiology,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Streptococcal Infections/*microbiology,Streptococcus suis/classification/*drug effects/ge,Vietnam",6,"{The antimicrobial resistance patterns and associated determinants in Streptococcus suis isolated from humans in southern Vietnam, 1997-2008}",NA,11,2011,NA,"1471-2334

She was admitted to the hospital due to acute delirium on March 21, 2014. Brain CT showed mild cerebral atrophy. Laboratory data showed hemogram, 10.5 g/ dL; WBC, 14,900/mL; CRP, 63.9 mg/L; and creatinine, 2.8 mg/dL. CXR showed mild bronchiectasis with probably superimposed infection. Empirical antibiotic was ceftazidime. The sputum culture yielded mixed normal flora. The blood and urine cultures showed no growth. However, CRP rose to 114.0 mg/L on March 31. Fosfomycin was added. The blood and sputum cultures showed no significant bacteria, but the urine culture yielded yeast-like organism. A CRP rose to 135.3 mg/L on April 7. Thus doripenem and fluconazole were used. Then condition was stable and she was discharged to a nursing home on April 14. On June 19, 2014, she returned with a fever of 38Â°C.

However, the epidemiology of A. baumannii causing burn-related bloodstream infections has rarely been reported. We retrospectively collected 81 A. baumannii isolates from the bloodstream of burn patients over a three-year period. Antibiotic susceptibility tests, the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant genes and sequence typing (ST) were conducted to characterize these strains. Most of the isolates showed an extensive drug-resistant phenotype. The resistance frequencies to imipenem and meropenem were 94{\%} and 91{\%}, respectively. The blaOXA-23-like gene, AmpC, IS-AmpC, PER and SIM are the five most prevalent resistant genes, and their prevalence rates are 93{\%} (75/81), 86{\%} (70/81), 73{\%} (59/81), 73{\%} (59/81) and 52{\%} (42/81), respectively. The 81 isolates were grouped into 10 known and 18 unknown ST types, with ST368 (38{\%}) being the most prevalent. Except for ST457 and four new types (STn2, STn6, STn11 and STn14), the remaining 23 ST types belonged to one clonal complex 92, which is most common among clinical isolate in China. The above results indicated that ST368 isolates possessing both the blaOXA-23-like gene and ampC gene were the main culprits of the increasing nosocomial A. baumannii infection in this study.

Isolates were initially screened with cefoxitin (30$\mu$g) and confirmed for production of AmpC beta-lactamases by M3DET. Phenotypically positive isolates were further confirmed by multiplex PCR targeting blaCIT, blaACC, blaEBC, blaDHA, blaFOX, blaMOX families Antimicrobial susceptibility and MIC's were also determined as per CLSI guideline. Results: Out of 126 Escherichia coli isolates 97(76.9{\%}) were found to be cefoxitin resistant and among them 46 (47.4{\%}) isolates were confirmed to be AmpC producers. Most of the AmpC positive isolates were found to be significantly multi-drug resistant and their minimum inhibition concentrations were above the break point. Out of 46 isolates 39 (84.7{\%}) showed genotypically positive for blaAmpCgenes (24CIT, 12DHA and 3EBC).

Methods: A total of 1789 E. coli and 90 Shigella from diarrhoeal patients and healthy controls in 2009-2010 and 1816 clinical samples isolated in October 2010 were analysed for imipenem resistance. Gramnegative strains were isolated from 403/1816 samples. 100 ESBLproducing E. coli isolated in 2008-2009 were also analysed. Imipenem susceptibility was determined and the presence of NDM-1 gene was assessed by PCR. NDM-1 positive isolates were characterized. Plasmid profiles were analyzed and presence of transmissible R-plasmid was determined by conjugation and hybridization. All NDM-1 positive patients were contacted and interviewed using a short standard questionnaire. Results: All E. coli and Shigella isolates from diarrhoeal patients and healthy controls were susceptible to imipenem. Among 403 Gramnegative clinical isolates, 55/403 (13.6{\%}) were resistant to imipenem and 14/403 (3.5{\%}) were NDM-1 positive. These 14 isolates were cultured from 12 patients with the following clinical diagnoses: UTI (n = 5), RTI (n = 4), wound infections (n = 1), unknown (n = 2). Of these 12 patients, 10 could be contacted. All 10 patients had received antibiotics during the last 3 months, 5 were treated with carbapenems. All patients reported hospitalization in last 3 months. The mean age of patients was 55 years and the male to female ratio was 1:2 (N = 12). Of the 10 patients, outcome of treatment was not clear for three, condition improved for three and two patients died. Among 100 ESBL producing E. coli and Klebsiella strains 4 were resistant to imipenem, of which 3 were NDM-1 positive.

Hardly any studies have correlated strain ribotypes, toxinotypes and multidrug resistant (MDR) profiles. To investigate these characteristics, 65 C. difficile isolates obtained from stool samples of patients whose cultures were negative on admission but became positive after 48 h of admission to the ICUs of our hospitals were studied to determine the prevalent ribotypes, toxinotypes and their relationship with the MDR profiles using ELISA/cytotoxicity assays, PCR and Etest methods. The toxin-producing strains were toxinotyped by the PCR-RFLP technique. Of the 65 isolates, 42 (64.6{\%}) were toxigenic (T). The isolates were of diverse ribotypes but types 097, 078, 056 and 039 (NT) were predominant. thirty (71.4{\%}) of 42 T and 13 (56.5{\%}) of 23 NT strains were multiresistant to 3 or more antibiotics. Only 3 toxinotypes (0, {""}V-like{""} and XII) were encountered. Of the 42 t strains, 30 (71.4{\%}) were of toxinotype 0, and 12 belonged to variant toxinotypes: 4 (9.4{\%}) to toxinotype XII and 8 (19{\%}) to {""}V-like{""} toxinotype in which amplified B1 PCR fragments was amplified as expected for toxinotype V but the A3 PCR fragment could not be amplified. The 43 mDR strains were assigned to 3 arbitrary resistance groups; groups 1, 11 and III. the most prevalent isolates (37; 86.1{\%}) were in group II. Of the predominant T ribotypes (097, 078 and 056), c. 62{\%} clustered in group II.

Resistance pattern of bacterial isolates determine empiric antibiotic therapy and influence outcome. AIMS: This study was planned to determine profile of bacterial isolates and their antibiotic resistance pattern among pediatric cancer patients. DESIGN: It was a retrospective, single institutional study. Materials and Methods: The study was carried out in the department of pediatric hematology-oncology of a tertiary care cancer centre in north India over a period of 24 months (2012-2014). Microbiological data pertaining to pediatric cancer patients, less than 18yrs of age was analysed. Results: Hence, 238 bacterial isolates were cultured from among 1757 blood, urine and other specimens. Gram negative bacteria were the most common (74{\%}) pathogens identified and E. coli and Klebsiella comprised 80{\%} of them. A high incidence of extended spectrum beta lactamase producing organisms (84{\%}), beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitor (78{\%}) and carbapenem resistance was observed (29{\%}). Blood stream infection with multi-drug resistant Klebsiella was associated with high mortality. The gram positive bacteria isolated were predominantly staphylococcus aureus and were antibiotic sensitive. Reduction in the number of culture positive isolates in the second year of our study was probably due to rigorous implementation of infection control measures. Conclusion: These results on microbiologic profile and antibiotic sensitivity pattern of the isolates will be extremely helpful in revision of antibiotic guidelines for our patients and in developing strategies for coping with high prevalence of multi-drug resistance. Antibiotic stewardship and strict implementation of infection control practices will be important components of this effort.",G Kapoor and N Sachdeva and S Jain,"1998-4774

10330,yes,kazakova2006,article,"Background: Increased Clostridium difficile-associated disease (CDAD) in a hospital and an affiliated long-term care facility continued despite infection control measures. We investigated this outbreak to determine risk factors and transmission settings. Methods: The CDAD cases were compared according to where the disease was likely acquired based on health care exposure and characterization of isolates from case patients, asymptomatic carriers, and the environment. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing, strain typing using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and toxinotyping were performed, and toxins A and B, binary toxin, and deletions in the tcdC gene were detected using polymerase chain reaction. Risk factors were examined in a case-control study, and overall antimicrobial use was compared at the hospital before and during the outbreak. Results: Significant increases were observed in hospital-acquired (0.19 vs 0.86; P{\textless}.001) and long-term care facility-acquired (0.04 vs 0.31; P=.004) CDAD cases per 100 admissions as a result of transmission of a toxinotype III strain at the hospital and a toxinotype 0 strain at the long-term care facility. The toxinotype III strain was positive for binary toxin, an 18-base pair deletion in tcdC, and increased resistance to fluoroquinolones. Independent risk factors for CDAD included use of fluoroquinolones (odds ratio [OR], 3.22; P=.04), cephalosporins (OR, 5.19; P=.006), and proton pump inhibitors (OR, 5.02; P=.02). A significant increase in fluoroquinolone use at the hospital took place during the outbreak (185.5 defined daily doses per 1000 patient-days vs 200.9 defined daily doses per 1000 patient-days; P{\textless}.001). Conclusions: The hospital outbreak of CDAD was caused by transmission of a more virulent, fluoroquinolone-resistant strain of C difficile. More selective fluoroquinolone and proton pump inhibitor use may be important in controlling and preventing such outbreaks. {\textcopyright}2006 American Medical Association.

METHOD: We first screened 35 T. b. rhodesiense strains in the mouse model, for sensitivity to melarsoprol (1.8, 3.6 and 7.2 mg/kg), diminazene aceturate (3.5, 7 and 14 mg/kg), suramin (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg) and isometamidium (0.1, 1.0 and 2 mg/kg). A 13 isolates suspected to be resistant were selected for further testing in vitro and in vivo. From the in vitro testing, IC(50) values were determined by short-term viability assay, and MIC values were calculated by long-term viability assay. For in vivo testing, doses higher than those in the initial screening test were used. RESULTS: Two T. b rhodesiense stocks expressed resistance in vivo to melarsoprol at 5 mg/kg and at 10 mg/kg. These strains had high IC(50) and MIC values consistent with those of the melarsoprol-resistant reference strain. Another isolate relapsed after treatment with 5 mg/kg of melarsoprol although it did not appear resistant in vitro. One isolate was resistant to diminazene at 14 mg/kg and another was resistant at both 14 and 28 mg/kg of diminazene. These two isolates had high IC(50) values consistent with the diminazene-resistant reference strain. Two isolates relapsed at a dose of 5 mg/kg of suramin, although no isolate appeared resistant in the in vitro tests. Two isolates were resistant to isometamidium at 1.0 mg/kg and had higher IC(50) values. Two isolates were cross-resistant to melarsoprol and diminazene and one isolate was cross-resistant to suramin and isometamidium.

10825,maybe,ko2009,article,"OBJECTIVES: The Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART) was intended to reveal the evolving profiles of antimicrobial resistance among Gram-negative pathogens causing intra-abdominal infections (IAIs). METHODS: Aerobic and facultatively anaerobic Gram-negative isolates were prospectively collected from patients with IAIs in the Asia/Pacific region between 2002 and 2006. Only clinically significant isolates were included for susceptibility tests by the microdilution method. Phenotypic identification of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production was performed on Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and Enterobacter spp., with the measurements of MICs of cefepime alone and in the presence of clavulanic acid. RESULTS: Of 7239 Gram-negative isolates, Enterobacteriaceae accounted for the majority (81.5{\%}), and the three major species were E. coli (42.5{\%}), Klebsiella pneumoniae (15.7{\%}) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9.6{\%}). The susceptibility rates of Enterobacteriaceae isolates to cephalosporins decreased, in parallel with the fact that the prevalence of ESBLs increased from 13{\%} in 2002 to 28{\%} in 2006. Among E. coli isolates, the proportion of isolates producing an ESBL varied greatly between countries, ranging from 38.6{\%} in China to 1.2{\%} in New Zealand, and ciprofloxacin susceptibility rate from 41.6{\%} in China to 95.8{\%} in New Zealand. Carbapenems and amikacin were in vitro active against more than 95{\%} of Enterobacteriaceae isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Antimicrobial resistance was frequently present among Gram-negative isolates from IAIs in the Asia/Pacific region. During the study period, there were increasing resistant rates of E. coli isolates to cephalosporins, but wide variations existed among countries. Regular updates of treatment guidelines for this region are necessary for empiric antimicrobial therapy.",W C Ko and P R Hsueh,0163-4453,J Infect,"*Drug Resistance, Bacterial,Abdominal Abscess/*microbiology,Animals,Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology,Asia,Australasia,Gram-Negative Bacteria/*drug effects/enzymology/is,Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections/*microbiology,Humans,Microbial Sensitivity Tests/methods,Prospective Studies,Quinolones/*pharmacology,beta-Lactamases/*biosynthesis/classification,beta-Lactams/*pharmacology",95--103,{Increasing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production and quinolone resistance among Gram-negative bacilli causing intra-abdominal infections in the Asia/Pacific region: data from the Smart Study 2002-2006},NA,59,2009,2,"1532-2742

11326,maybe,kwan2008a,article,"Background: The purpose of the present study was to assess the epidemiology and resistance patterns of bacteria causing urinary tract infections in children who were admitted to Kingston General Hospital (Kingston, Ontario) - the regional tertiary care hospital of southeastern Ontario. Methods: A retrospective chart review of patients one to 18 years of age who were admitted to Kingston General Hospital with a discharge diagnosis of urinary tract infection between 2002 and early 2006 was undertaken. Results: One hundred forty-two patient charts were reviewed, of which 56.3{\%} of patients were female. The mean age of the patients was 12.3 months. The most common bacteria identified on urine culture over a five-year period were Escherichia coli (71.6{\%}), Enterococcus species (5.7{\%}) and Klebsiella species (5.0{\%}). Bacteria were frequently resistant to ampicillin (54.4{\%}) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) (40.4{\%}). During the three months before admission, bacteria resistant to ampicillin were cultured from the urine of 75.6{\%} of patients who were receiving some antibiotic, compared with 44{\%} of children with no documented use of antibiotics (P{\textless}0.0001). Resistance to TMP-SMX in those with pre-existing genitourinary disease was 72.2{\%} versus 31.8{\%} in those without (P{\textless}0.0001). Patients who had previous admissions for urinary tract infections also showed greater resistance to TMP-SMX (70.6{\%} versus 32.7{\%}; P{\textless}0.005), cefazolin (64.7{\%} versus 20.0{\%}; P{\textless}0.0001) and nitrofurantoin (58.8{\%} versus 18.2{\%}; P{\textless}0.0001). Conclusions: There was a high resistance to ampicillin. Risk factors for resistant bacteria included the use of antibiotics three months before admission, previous genitourinary disease and previous admissions for urinary tract infections. In the presence of these risk factors, a third-generation cephalosporin as first-line antimicrobial therapy is recommended. However, the combination of ampicillin plus gentamicin can be considered for empirical therapy in low-risk patients. {\textcopyright} 2008 Pulsus Group Inc.

The transferability of the phenotypes was tested by conjugation to Escherichia coli J53. The isoelectric point was determinate by isoelectrofocalisation. Results: This resistance was carried by a 60 kb plasmid that encoded a $\beta$-lactamase with a pI of 5.4. This $\beta$-lactamase revealed identity with the blaTEM-1 gene encoding the TEM-1 $\beta$-lactamase, except for a replacement of the Val residue at position 84 by Ile, and the Ala residue at position 184 by Val. These two mutations were encountered in TEM-116 $\beta$-lactamase.

11737,yes,lee2015f,article,"Purpose: To report an isolate of Klebsiella pneumoniae with Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC), which is the first isolate of KPC-producing strain at a regional hospital. Methods: The K. pneumoniae was isolated from sputum specimen in a patient who came from nursing home. The antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by disk diffusion test and the Phoenix NMIC/ID-32 identification system (Becton Dickinson Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, MD). The results were interpreted according to the criteria recommended by the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute 2014. The modified Hodge test (MHT) was performed for the presence of carbapenemase. The carbapenemase genes were confirmed at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), Taiwan. Results: The K. pneumoniae was susceptible to gentamicin, amikacin, andtrimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole, but resistant to piperacillin-tazobactam, levofloxacin, cefuroxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, imipenem, and meropenem. The MHT revealed the presence of a carbapenemase, and then the CDC confirmed that the carbapenemase was KPC. Conclusions: This was the first isolate of KPC-producing strain in this hospital. Especially, the strain was not a hospital-acquired strain, but a nursing home-acquired strain. Infection control measures are recognized the important measure to prevent the spread of multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains.

We performed susceptibility tests for mupirocin, which is in widespread clinical use in Korea, and four new antimicrobials, daptomycin, linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin and tigecycline, against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium isolated from Korean patients in 1998 and 2005 to evaluate and compare the in vitro activity of these antimicrobials. Among these agents, quinupristin/dalfopristin, which is rarely used in hospitals in Korea, showed relatively high resistance to several vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) isolated in 2005. Likewise, daptomycin, linezolid and tigecycline have not yet been in clinical use in Korea. However, our results showed that most of the 2005 VRE isolates were already resistant to linezolid and daptomycin (highest minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value {\textgreater}100 microg/ml). Compared with the other four antimicrobial agents tested in this study, tigecycline generally showed the greatest activity against VRE. However, four strains of 2005 isolates exhibited resistance against tigecycline (MIC {\textgreater}12.5 microg/ml). Almost all VRE were resistant to mupirocin, whereas all E. faecium isolated in 1998 were inhibited at concentrations between 0.8 to approximately 1.6 microg/ml. In conclusion, resistances to these new antimicrobial agents were exhibited in most of VRE strains even though these new antibiotics have been rarely used in Korean hospitals.",D K Lee and Y Kim and K S Park and J W Yang and K Kim and N J Ha,"1225-8687 (print)

A KPC-2-producing multidrug-resistant (MDR) K. pneumoniae clinical isolate was obtained from a patient admitted to a Korean hospital in 2011. The strain MP14 was resistant to all tested $\beta$-lactams including monobactam, amikacin, levofloxacin, and cotrimoxazole, but susceptible to tigecycline and colistin. Resistome analysis showed the presence of $\beta$-lactamase genes including blaKPC-2, blaSHV-11, blaTEM-169, and blaOXA-9. MP14 also possessed aac(6â²-)Ib, aadA2, and aph(3â²-)Ia as aminoglycoside resistance-encoding genes, mph(A) for macrolides, oqxA and oqxB for quinolone, catA1 for phenicol, sul1 for sulfonamide, and dfrA12 for trimethoprim. Both SNP tree and cgMLST analysis showed the close relatedness with the KPC producers (KPNIH strains) isolated from an outbreak in the USA and colistin-resistant strains isolated in Italy. The plasmid-scaffold genes in plasmids pKpQil, pKpQil-IT, pKPN3, or pKPN-IT were identified in MP14, KPNIH, and Italian strains. The KPC-2-producing MDR K. pneumoniae ST258 stain isolated in Korea was highly clonally related with MDR K. pneumoniae strains from the USA and Italy.

13019,yes,mandal2006,article,"BACKGROUND: Antibiotic resistance pattern and R-plasmid of Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi A isolates from Kolkata, India are not well documented. AIMS: To determine the trend of antibiotic resistance of S. paratyphi A isolates. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: A retrospective study was carried out using blood culture isolates of S. paratyphi A (1991 to 2005) obtained from patients of enteric fever from Asansol and Kolkata and its suburbs (India). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antibiotic susceptibility pattern, using seven antibiotics, for the isolates was determined following agar dilution and disk diffusion methods. Transferability of multidrug resistance to ampicillin (Am), chloramphenicol (Chl), cotrimoxazole (Cot) and tetracycline (Tet) among the isolates was determined by in vitro conjugation. The multi-drug resistant (MDR) and antibiotic susceptible S. paratyphi A strains and the trans-conjugants were screened for the presence of plasmid. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: The t test was used to compare the difference between mean minimum inhibitory concentration values of ciprofloxacin (Cp) for nalidixic acid (Nx)-resistant and Nalidixic acid (Nx)-susceptible isolates. RESULTS: Among 13 outbreak causing isolates in 1991, 9 (69.23{\%}) showed AmChlCotTet-resistance, while 4 (30.77{\%}) Cot-resistance only. During 1992-1994, all 13 isolates were susceptible to Am, Chl, Cot and Tet. During 1995-2005, isolates demonstrated different resistance patterns and emergence of nalidixic acid (Nx)-resistance. A transferable plasmid conferring AmChlCotTet-resistance was detected among MDR isolates. All the isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone (Ctx) and ciprofloxacin (Cp). Association between Nalidixic acid (Nx)-resistance and reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (Cp) among 59 S. paratyphi A isolates was noticed (P {\textless} 0.001). CONCLUSION: Vigilance for R-plasmid and surveillance of antibiotic susceptibility among S. paratyphi A isolates in and around Kolkata, India, are mandatory in order to combat antibiotic resistance of the isolates in this part of the world.",S Mandal and M D Mandal and N K Pal,"0022-3859 (print)

13495,yes,mbanga2010,article,"OBJECTIVE: To obtain data on the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in bacteria isolated from patients with suspected urinary tract infection in Bulawayo province, Zimbabwe. METHOD: Over a period of one year, 257 urine samples were analyzed for bacteria by standard procedures. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of isolated bacteria was done using the disk diffusion method. RESULTS: The isolated bacteria were Escherichia coli (40.3{\%}), coagulase negative Staphylococcus (16.1{\%}), Klebsiella spp (11.2{\%}), Staphylococcus aureus (8{\%}), Group A Streptococcus (8{\%}) and Klebsiella oxytoca (8{\%}). Antibiotic susceptibility testing was done using the disc diffusion method on Mueller-Hinton agar. It revealed a high resistance to ampicillin (84.5{\%}) and cotrimoxazole (68.5{\%}) among the Gram negative bacilli. Gram positive cocci showed resistance to Nalidixic acid (81{\%}) and cotrimoxazole (69{\%}). E. coli was susceptible to most of the drugs but 84{\%} of the strains were resistant to ampicillin, and 68{\%} to cotrimoxazole. All isolates were sensitive to Nicene. CONCLUSION: The high levels of ampicillin and cotrimoxazole resistance in E. coli and other enterobactericiae suggest the need to perform urinalysis and antibiotic susceptibility testing in all patients. Nicene should be considered as the first line therapy for all age groups. It is important for physicians to know susceptibility data for UTIs in order to optimize the use of empirical therapy.",J Mbanga and S Dube and H Munyanduki,"0856-8960 (print)

The objectives of this prospective cohort study was to determine the resistance profile of E. coli for two categories of patients ({\textless} 49 years and {\textgreater} or = 50 years), risk factors for ESBL positivity and to investigate the molecular epidemiology of ESBL type CTX-M enzymes. A total of 885 strains of E. coli were isolated in the Infectious Diseases Hospital laboratory between June 2008 and June 2011 and E. coli resistance due to ESBL production was noted in 17{\%} of cases. We found that previous therapy with cephalosporins, hospitalization and urinary catheter were risk factors for ESBL positivity. We noted significant differences concerning resistance rate between patients under 49 years and aged more than 50 years for ciprofloxacin (19{\%} and 38{\%}, respectively, p = 0,0001), for gentamicin (15{\%} and 23{\%}, p = 0,008), ceftazidime (15{\%} and 24{\%}, p = 0,001) and ESBL positivity (14{\%} and 20{\%}, p = 0.009).

14311,maybe,moon2010,article,"Epidemiologic data on the etiologic organisms is important for appropriate empirical antibiotic treatment of bacterial meningitis. We identified the etiologies of community-acquired bacterial meningitis in Korean adults and the associated epidemiological factors. A retrospective, multicenter nationwide study was carried out. Patients 18 years of age or older with community-acquired bacterial meningitis with a confirmed pathogen were enrolled. Demographic, clinical, and microbiological data were collected. One hundred and ninety-five cases were collected. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common pathogen (50.8{\%}), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (10.3{\%}), Klebsiella pneumoniae (7.7{\%}), Listeria monocytogenes (6.7{\%}), and group B Streptococcus (3.1{\%}). The penicillin resistance rate of the S. pneumoniae was 60.3{\%}; 40.0{\%} of the organisms were not susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins. The combination of third-generation cephalosporin with vancomycin was used in 76.3{\%} of cases. Steroids were given before or with the first dose of antibiotics in 37.4{\%} of patients. The 30-day mortality rate was 20.5{\%} and neurological sequelae developed in 15.6{\%} of cases. S. pneumoniae was the most common organism identified in community-acquired bacterial meningitis among Korean adults.

15331,maybe,oconnor2015,article,"AIM: To report the first Irish outbreak of cfr-mediated linezolid-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis. METHODS: Linezolid-resistant S. epidermidis isolated at University Hospital Limerick from four blood cultures, one wound and four screening swabs (from nine patients) between April and June 2013 were characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) and staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCCmec) typing. Antibiotic susceptibilities were determined according to the guidelines of the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy. The outbreak was controlled through prohibiting prescription and use of linezolid, adherence to infection prevention and control practices, enhanced environmental cleaning, isolation of affected patients, and hospital-wide education programmes. FINDINGS: PFGE showed that all nine isolates represented a single clonal strain. MLST showed that they belonged to ST2, and SCCmec typing showed that they encoded a variant of SCCmecIII. All nine isolates were cfr positive, and eight isolates were positive for the G2576T 23S rRNA mutation commonly associated with linezolid resistance. Isolates exhibited multiple antibiotic resistances (i.e. linezolid, gentamicin, methicillin, clindamycin, ciprofloxacin, fusidic acid and rifampicin). The adopted infection prevention intervention was effective, and the outbreak was limited to the affected intensive care unit. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first documented outbreak of cfr-mediated linezolid-resistant S. epidermidis in the Republic of Ireland. Despite this, and due to existing outbreak management protocols, the responsible micro-organism and source were identified efficiently. However, it became apparent that staff knowledge of antimicrobial susceptibilities and appropriate hygiene practices were suboptimal at the time of the outbreak, and that educational interventions (and re-inforcement) are necessary to avoid occurrence of antimicrobial resistance and outbreaks such as reported here.",C O'Connor and J Powell and C Finnegan and A O'Gorman and S Barrett and K L Hopkins and B Pichon and R Hill and L Power and N Woodford and J C Coffey and A Kearns and N H O'Connell and C P Dunne,0195-6701,J Hosp Infect,"*Cross Infection/epidemiology/microbiology/prevent,23S rRNA methyltransferase,Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology,Disease Outbreaks/prevention {\&} control,Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial/drug effects/,Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field,Female,First outbreak,Hospitals, Teaching,Humans,Incidence,Infection Control/*methods,Ireland,Ireland/epidemiology,Linezolid/pharmacology,Male,Middle Aged,Multi-resistance,Mutation,Oxazolidinone resistance,Plasmid-mediated,RNA, Ribosomal, 23S,Staphylococcal Infections/drug therapy/*epidemiolo,Staphylococci,Staphylococcus epidermidis/*drug effects/genetics/,Treatment Outcome",316--321,"{Incidence, management and outcomes of the first cfr-mediated linezolid-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis outbreak in a tertiary referral centre in the Republic of Ireland}",NA,90,2015,4,"1532-2939

We analyzed 65 (54 nonreplicate) Acinetobacter isolates from 48 patients (46 hospitalized and 2 outpatient trainees entering the military) from October 2004 to October 2005 for genotypic similarities, time-space relatedness, and antibiotic susceptibility. Clinical and surveillance cultures were compared by amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) genomic fingerprinting to each other and to strains of a reference database. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined, and multiplex PCR was performed for OXA-23-like, -24-like, -51-like, and -58-like carbapenemases. Records were reviewed for overlapping hospital stays of the most frequent genotypes, and risk ratios were calculated for any association of genotype with severity of Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score or injury severity score (ISS) and previous antibiotic use. Nineteen genotypes were identified; two predominated, one consistent with an emerging novel international clone and the other unique to our database. Both predominant genotypes were carbapenem resistant, were present at another hospital before patients' admission to our facility, and were associated with higher APACHE II scores, higher ISSs, and previous carbapenem antibiotics in comparison with other genotypes. One predominated in wound and respiratory isolates, and the other predominated in wound and skin surveillance samples. Several other genotypes were identified as European clones I to III. Acinetobacter genotypes from recruits upon entry to the military, unlike those in hospitalized patients, did not include carbapenem-resistant genotypes. Acinetobacter species isolated from battlefield casualties are diverse, including genotypes belonging to European clones I to III.

16481,maybe,pfeifer2013,article,"We report the emergence of a multidrug-resistant Haemophilus influenzae strain in a patient with common variable immunodeficiency suffering from recurrent bronchopneumonia caused by H. influenzae. After the patient had received several antibiotic therapies, a strain was isolated showing resistance to ampicillin, ampicillin/sulbactam, cefazolin, cefuroxime, ciprofloxacin, and clarithromycin. Polymerase chain reaction analyses and sequencing revealed the presence of the beta-lactamase gene blaTEM-1, two mutations (A502T and R517H) in the ftsI gene encoding the transpeptidase region of the penicillin-binding protein 3, and one mutation in the ribosomal protein gene L4 (G65D) conferring resistance to beta-lactams and macrolides, respectively. Additionally, the plasmid-encoded aac(6â²)-Ib-cr gene mediating slightly reduced susceptibility to quinolones and two mutations in the DNA gyrase gene gyrA and one mutation in the topoisomerase IV gene parC were identified leading to a high-level fluoroquinolone-resistant phenotype. In conclusion, the treatment of H. influenzae infections accompanied by high bacterial loads such as bronchopneumonia can be complicated by the selection of multidrug-resistant strains. Moreover, the emergence of aac(6â²)-Ib-cr in H. influenzae causing low fluoroquinolone resistance levels might have contributed to the selection of DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV mutants. {\textcopyright} Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2013.",Y Pfeifer and I Meisinger and K Brechtel and S GrÃ¶bner,"1076-6294

The aim of this study was to investigate the microbiological and epidemiological characteristics of a VRE outbreak that occurred between August 2010 and September 2011 in Porto Alegre, South Brazil. METHODOLOGY: Twenty-nine isolates from inpatients of Mae de Deus Hospital that were identified and characterized for their susceptibility profile, vancomycin genotype, presence of esp gene, biofilm production, and clonal relationship were collected. Patients' records were reviewed for clinical information. RESULTS: All isolates were identified as vancomycin/ampicillin resistant E. faecium carrying the vanA gene. Almost all were susceptible to gentamicin and streptomycin. Most patients died and were associated with a hemodialysis unit stay. All but the first isolate were clustered in a main clone.

17519,maybe,reyna-figueroa2007,article,Reduced susceptibility to vancomycin has been reported among clinical isolates of Staphylococcus in previous studies. The present study describes a heteroresistant Staphylococci strain from the cerebrospinal fluid of a 17 day-old premature male infant with neonatal meningitis. Screening was done for 44 strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci using Wong 's techniques (Disk-agar method with vancomycin-salt agar to demonstrate satellitism around an aztreonam disk). Strains were susceptible to vancomycin as disclosed by an automated antimicrobial susceptibly test (Microscan System Dade Behring).

Methods: The collection studied included 10 sequential isolates from each of 10 CF patients. Each sequential isolate was separated by at least a 6-month interval, covering up to an 8-year period from 2003 to 2010. Colony morphotypes were recorded, and antibiotic susceptibility profiles (ceftazidime, cefepime, imipenem, meropenem, ciprofloxacin, tobramycin, and colistin) were determined by E-test, using EUCAST breakpoints. All isolates were typed by Pulsed-Field-Gel- Electrophoresis (PFGE) using SpeI as restriction enzyme. One representative isolate from each clone and patient was further analysed by Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) using available protocols and databases (http://pubmlst.org/paeruginosa/). Results: Following PFGE results, 17 strains were analysed by MLST, leading to the identification of 14 sequence types (ST), eight of which (57{\%}) were new. One of them (ST-274), was detected in three patients, and one more patient harboured a closely related clone differing only by single point mutations in two alleles. Remarkably, ST-274 has been also detected (MLST database) in several CF patients from Australia, Austria, and France. Two other patients shared the same clone (ST- 299), whereas all other clones were found in single patients. In five of the patients a single clone was detected through the whole study period, remarkably including all four patients with ST-274 or the related clone. The remaining five patients showed the coexistence of several clones (2-4) or clonal replacements, including the superinfection with the Liverpool Epidemic Strain (LES-1, ST-146) in one of the patients. An important intra and inter clonal and patient variability of resistance patterns was documented, but with a significant trend towards the accumulation of resistance mechanisms, as evidenced by an average resistance to 0.7 antibiotics in the initial isolates from each patient compared to 2.0 in the last isolates. Conclusion: Despite not particularly associated to resistance, this work alerts on the linkage to persistent colonization and wide dissemination among CF patients of ST-274.

METHOD: This retrospective study included 300 strains of S. agalactiae from several pathological samples collected at the Monastir Fattouma Borguiba Hospital. The identification was based on conventional bacteriological features. Serogrouping was performed using agglutination tests. The susceptibility to antibiotics was studied according to the Antibiogram Committee of the French Society of Microbiology recommendations. RESULTS: S. agalactiae was mainly isolated from patients with vaginal infections (31.3{\%}) and urinary tract infections (24.7{\%}). All strains were susceptible to penicillin G. Resistance was mostly observed to erythromycin (38.5{\%}) and lincomycin (36.6{\%}). 6.5{\%} were highly resistant to kanamycin and 0.6{\%} to gentamicin.

Isolate from the patient's peripheral and catheter blood cultures was identified as M. wisconsensis by Phoenix 100 (Becton Dickinson Co., Sparks, MD, USA) automated system and, was found susceptible to ampicillin-sulbactam, imipenem, meropenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime and trimethoprim-sulphametoxazole, whereas resistant to amikacin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, cefoxitin, aztreonam, ceftriaxone and ceftazidime. Identification was confirmed by BD BBL Crystal GN (Becton Dickinson Co., Sparks, MD, USA) identification system. Other distant infectious focuses explaining the positive blood culture result were not determined. The patient's clinical condition improved completely and she was discharged after two weeks of intravenous antibiotic therapy.

19575,yes,soes2009a,article,"Increasing rates of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) with an unusual, severe course have been reported in several countries; this rise has partly been ascribed to the emergence of a virulent strain, C. difficile PCR ribotype 027 (CD027). An intriguing question is whether this could be related to increasing consumption of broadspectrum antibiotics. From 1997 to 2007, the number of hospital discharges in Denmark with the diagnosis enterocolitis caused by C. difficile increased from eight to 23 per 100,000 hospital discharges. This increase was proportional to a concomitant rise in the consumption of fluoroquinolones and cephalosporins. The first outbreak of CD027 in Denmark occurred from October 2006 to August 2007 and included 13 patients, most of them elderly, admitted to three hospitals in the same region. Most of the patients had overlapping periods of admission. All patients had been treated with broadspectrum antibiotics, in particular cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones, prior to positive culture of CD027. 30 days after confirmation of diagnosis, three of the 13 patients had died. Taken together, the data support the hypothesis that the increasing use of certain broadspectrum antibiotics may be related to a possible increase of C. difficile infection, and show that the specific contribution by CD027 in its emergence needs to be determined.",L Soes and K Molbak and S Strobaek and K {Truberg Jensen} and M Torpdahl and S Persson and M Kemp and K E Olsen,1025-496x,Euro Surveill,"Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Cephalosporins/administration {\&} dosage/*adverse ef,Clostridium difficile/drug effects/*genetics,Denmark,Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial/drug effects/,Enterocolitis, Pseudomembranous/chemically induced,Female,Fluoroquinolones/administration {\&} dosage/*adverse,Humans,Male,Middle Aged,Retrospective Studies,Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*t,Ribotyping/*trends",NA,{The emergence of Clostridium difficile PCR ribotype 027 in Denmark--a possible link with the increased consumption of fluoroquinolones and cephalosporins?},NA,14,2009,15,"1560-7917

19607,yes,sole2011a,article,"Objectives: Metallo-$\beta$-lactamases (MBL) are important enzymes that hydrolyze all $\beta$-lactam antibiotics except aztreonam. Recently, a Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate carrying a novel carbapenemase, named NDM-1, was identified from a Swedish patient transferred from India. In this study, we report the first description of an E. coli strain producing NDM-1 in Spain. Methods: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by BD Phoenix and Etest. Hodge and Imipenem-EDTA Etest synergy tests were used to screen for MBL production. Detection of genes encoding carbapenemases (VIM, IMP, NDM), ESBLs, plasmid-mediated cephalosporinases, armA (to investigate aminoglycoside resistance) as well as genes encoding heat-stable (ST), heat-labile (LT) toxins, verotoxins (VT) and enteroaggregative E. coli virulence factors was performed by PCR and sequence analysis. Conjugative transfer between DVR22 and E. coli J53 was done by conventional biparental mating. Plasmid analysis was performed both to the NDM-1 bearing strain and selected transconjugants. After a four month period another stool specimen from the same patient was screened to detect NDM-1 carriage. Results: A carbapenem-resistant E. coli (DVR22) was recovered from a stool specimen from a patient with traveller's diarrhoea who had travelled to India. The DVR22 strain was resistant to all antibiotics tested except tigecycline, fosfomycin and colistin. MICs of carbapenems were as follows: imipenem (8 $\mu$g/ml), meropenem (8 mu;g/ml), ertapenem (24 mu;g/ml) and doripenem (6 mu;g/ml). Hodge and Imipenem-EDTA Etest synergy tests were positive. PCR and sequencing identified the presence of genes encoding NDM-1, DHA, CTX-M-15, TEM-1 and armA genes. E. coli transconjugants showed resistance to aminoglycosides and all $\beta$-lactam antibiotics and were positive for NDM-1, CTX-M-15, DHA, TEM-1 and armA genes. Plasmid analysis revealed that E. coli transconjugants harboured a circa 180-kb plasmid. PCR screening of genes encoding virulence factors of diarrhoeagenic E. coli was negative. Four months later the DVR22 strain was no longer isolated from the stool of this patient. Conclusions: This is the first isolation of an NDM-1 metallo-$\beta$-lactamase in Spain. The location of NDM-1 in a conjugative plasmid increases the risk of dissemination and transfer to other bacteria. Our results, however, suggest that this strain does not persist long in the intestinal tract, most likely due to the fitness cost associated with the conjugative plasmid.",M M SolÃ© and C Pitart and P Salvador and L MÍ¡noz and I Oliveira and J GascÃ³n and I Roca and A {FÃ brega} and F Marco and J Vila,1198-743x,Clinical Microbiology and Infection,"Escherichia coli,India,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Spain,aminoglycoside,antibiotic agent,antibiotic sensitivity,aztreonam,bacterium,beta lactam antibiotic,carbapenem,carbapenem derivative,carbapenemase,colistin,diarrhea,diarrheagenic Escherichia coli,doripenem,edetic acid,enteroaggregative Escherichia coli,enzyme,epsilometer test,ertapenem,fitness,fosfomycin,gene,heat,human,imipenem,inosine phosphate,intestine,mating,meropenem,patient,penicillinase,plasmid,risk,screening,sequence analysis,tigecycline,toxin,travel,virulence factor",s139,{First description of an Escherichia coli strain producing NDM-1 carbapenemase in Spain},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l70599321 http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-0691.2011.03558.x http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=1198743x{\&}id=doi:10.1111{\%}2fj.1469-0691.2011.03558.x{\&}atitle=f,17,2011,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,yes,jake,yes,nchedo,nchedo,zach,yes,zm_6.csv,NA,NA,zm_6_3.mex,yes,journal

20086,maybe,subramanian2016,article,"Purpose: blaNDM genes are MBL genes that confer resistance to carbapenems. Globally, they are associated with diverse clones and plasmids. In this study, we characterised three isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae-harbouring blaNDM1 from patients undergoing chronic haemodialysis and renal transplantation. Materials and Methods: 3 blaNDM1 -producing K. pneumoniae were isolated from end-stage renal disease patients undergoing haemodialysis and renal transplantation from a nephrology unit. All the three isolates were screened for clinically relevant resistant genes. Plasmid replicon content was analysed by polymerase chain reaction based replicon typing. Conjugation assays were done using azide-resistant Escherichia coli J53 as the recipient strain. Multilocus sequence typing and variable number tandem repeat typing were done to find the clonality. Replicon sequence based typing was attempted to find the diversity of replicon-associated sequences in IncHI3 plasmids. Results: All the 3 blaNDM positive isolates possessed the New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) allele with an IncHI3 plasmid which was not transferable in one isolate. The isolates were found to be sequence type 14 (ST14; 2 nos) and ST38 both of which were previously reported to be the NDM-producing K. pneumoniae STs prevalent in India. Replicon sequence analysis revealed limited sequence diversity within the repHI3 and repFIB locus. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of IncHI3, a newly assigned enterobacterial plasmid incompatibility group from India.

METHODS: A total of 44 Shigella isolates were collected from Iranian patients admitted to Milad Hospital, Tehran, Iran, during 2008-10. Of these, 37 were serotyped and characterized by MIC determination. A subset of eight suspected extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers (six Shigella sonnei phase II and two Shigella flexneri type 1b) were examined for the presence of genes encoding cephalosporin resistance. The presence of PMQR was assessed in one S. flexneri isolate exhibiting low-level resistance to ciprofloxacin and susceptibility to nalidixic acid. PFGE was performed on 25 S. sonnei phase II isolates. RESULTS: Of the isolates, 25 (68{\%}) were S. sonnei phase II, with 5 (14{\%}) S. flexneri, 5 (14{\%}) Shigella dysenteriae type 2, and 2 (5{\%}) Shigella boydii type 2. Resistance to at least threeclasses of antimicrobials was detected in all species. The presence of bla(CTX-M-15) and the AmpC beta-lactamase producer bla(CMY-2) was confirmed in five and one S. sonnei phase II isolates, respectively. One of the two S. flexneri type 1b that contained bla(CTX-M-15) also harboured a qnrS1 gene. PFGE identified sevenPFGE profiles; the main cluster included 15 of the strains, suggesting low genetic diversity between isolates or the presence of an endemic clone in Iran. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first known description of ESBL-producing and AmpC beta-lactamase-producing Shigella and of PMQR Shigella in Iran. The emergence of CTX-15, CMY-2 and qnrS1 genes may compromise the treatment of shigellosis.

It has been isolated from water, water from ultrafiltration systems and bottled mineral water. To date, 19 cases of bacteremia, two cases of peritonitis and one case of tenosynovitis associated with C. pauculus have been reported in English literature. In this paper, we report the first case of C. pauculus ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in Turkey. A 47 years-old female with breast cancer was performed total mastectomy six years ago and received six cures of chemotherapy after surgery. The patient was hospitalized in medical oncology clinic with complaints of weight loss, nausea and vomiting for one year. Since she had problems of consiousness, dysphagia and pitosis, lumbar puncture was performed to rule out central nervous system infection or metastasis. Cryptococcal meningitis was diagnosed upon the examination of Indian-ink stained smear of cerebrospinal fluid and amphotericin B was initiated. On the 11th day of her follow up, she developed respiratory distress and was transferred to pulmonary intensive care and underwent invasive mechanical ventilator (IMV) therapy. On the 4th day of IMV; a new infiltration was detected on the upper zone of chest X-ray in addition to fever (38.3 degrees C) and intense endotracheal secretion. Therefore, bronchoscopic examination was performed and bronchoalveolar lavage and bronchoscope aspiration materials were obtained and cultivated. Bacteria grown at blood agar and EMB agar after 48 hours of incubation were stained as gram-negative bacilli and identified as C. pauculus by VITEK 2 compact system (bioMerieux Inc, USA). The strain was susceptible to ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, piperacilin/tazobactam and resistant to amikacin. The case was considered as C. pauculus VAP and imipenem (500 mg, 4 x 1) for 14 days was initiated. Clinical and microbiological resolution was achieved by imipenem therapy.

21083,yes,trevino2010a,article,"Nosocomial infections caused by multidrug-resistant and carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas putida isolates have been reported occasionally in severely ill or immunocompromised patients. Here we report the microbiological characteristics of what are believed to be the two first carbapenem-resistant VIM metallo-$\beta$-lactamase (MBL)-producing P. putida strains in Spain, which were isolated from patients at the University Hospital Complex of Santiago de Compostela. Both patients were immunocompromised with severe underlying diseases and had been hospitalized for more than 15 days. One of them had previously been treated with a broad-spectrum therapy. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed that both strains were resistant to piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftazidime, cefepime, imipenem, meropenem, gentamicin, tobramycin, aztreonam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxacin, but sensitive to amikacin and colistin. For both isolates PCR and sequencing was positive for the blaVIM-2 gene. Fingerprinting analysis revealed these were two different strains. One patient recovered clinically and one died; no direct link could be established between the isolation of P. putida and death. Our data expose the emergence of multidrug-resistant P. putida VIM-2 MBL, probably arising by independent horizontal transfer of resistance genes. So, although P. putida is not frequently isolated, it may survive easily in the hospital setting and occasionally cause difficult-to-treat nosocomial infections in severely ill patients. {\textcopyright} 2010 SGM.",M TreviÃ±o and L Moldes and M HernÃ¡ndez and L Mart\'{i}nez-Lamas and C Garc\'{i}a-Riestra and B J Regueiro,0022-2615,Journal of Medical Microbiology,"DNA fingerprinting,Pseudomonas putida,Spain,aged,amikacin,antibiotic sensitivity,article,aztreonam,bacterial strain,bacterium isolate,carbapenem,case report,cefepime,ceftazidime,ceftriaxone,ciprofloxacin,colistin,cotrimoxazole,disease severity,female,gene sequence,gentamicin,hospital infection,human,imipenem,immunocompromised patient,male,meropenem,metallo beta lactamase,nonhuman,piperacillin plus tazobactam,polymerase chain reaction,priority journal,single drug dose,survival,tobramycin",853--855,{Nosocomial infection by VIM-2 metallo-$\beta$-lactamase-producing Pseudomonas putida},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l359158120 http://dx.doi.org/10.1099/jmm.0.018036-0 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=00222615{\&}id=doi:10.1099{\%}2fjmm.0.018036-0{\&}atitle=nosocomial+infection,59,2010,7,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,yes,erica,no,mushtaq,allison,zach,yes,zm_6.csv,NA,NA,zm_6_4.mex,yes,journal

Herein we report the results of the subsequent investigation. DESIGN AND METHODS: The investigation included environmental cultures for source investigation, molecular analysis by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to reveal the identity of the strains, and determination of the bactericidal activity of the glutaraldehyde-based disinfectant used for automated endoscope reprocessing. In addition, patient outcome was analyzed by medical chart review, and incidence rates of clinical samples with P. aeruginosa were compared. SETTING: The University Hospital of Basel is an 855-bed tertiary care center in Basel, Switzerland. Approximately 1,700 flexible bronchoscopic, 2,500 gastroscopic, 1,400 colonoscopic, 140 endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographic, and 140 endosonographic procedures are performed annually. RESULTS: P. aeruginosa was detected in samples obtained from endoscopes in November 2009 for the first time since the initiation of surveillance in 2006. It was found in the rinsing water and in the drain of 1 of the 2 automated endoscope reprocessors. PFGE revealed 2 distinct P. aeruginosa strains, one in each reprocessor. The glutaraldehyde-based disinfectant showed no activity against the 2 pseudo-outbreak strains when used in the recommended concentration under standard conditions. After medical chart review, 6 patients with lower respiratory tract and bloodstream infections were identified as having a possible epidemiological link to the pseudo-outbreak strain.

21389,yes,uzzaman2014,article,"Objectives: To investigate the genes of antibiotic resistance among isolates from the first reported carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) outbreak in a tertiary care hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Methods: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed on bacterial isolates using the Microscan Walkaway system (Siemens, Germany) and was confirmed by Etest (AB Biodisk, Sweden). bla-CTX-M, -SHV, -TEM, -OXA-48, OXA-A,B,C,D, -KPC, -NDM, -VIM, -IMP, integron 1, and outer membrane proteins(Omp)-35 and Omp-36 were investigated by PCR amplification and direct sequencing of PCR products. Isolates were sequence-typed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Results: All isolates were resistant to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, and piperacillin-tazobactam, and 91{\%} (21 out of 23) were resistant to amikacin and gentamicin. All isolates except two from a single patient were resistant to one of the carbapenems. CTX-M and SHV genes were detected in all isolates, CTX-M-15 and SHV-1 types being predominant among these extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). TEM-1 was found in all except one isolate (isolate 3). Significantly, the OXA-48 gene was also found in all isolates. OXA-D-gene was found in three out of 23 isolates. KPC, NDM, OXA-A, -B, -C, VIM, and IMP genes were absent in all isolates. Disruption of the Omp-36 gene due to insertion of transposon IS903 and/or IS4 was detected in four out of 23 isolates, and some unique variations were also observed in this gene, including an insertion of two amino acids in the L3 region of Omp-36 in one isolate (isolate 3) and a mutation resulting in a premature stop codon in another isolate (isolate 25). MLST revealed ST29 to be the predominant sequence type (17 out of 23 isolates, 74{\%}). Three were ST709 and one each was ST37 and ST111; one isolate had an unknown ST. Conclusions: This is probably the first reported outbreak of multidrug/carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella infection involving the OXA-48 gene from Saudi Arabia. Although the presence of ESBLs such as OXA, CTX-M, TEM, and SHV are predictable reasons for resistance, variations in the Omp-36 gene might also have precipitated this phenomenon. Disruption of the Omp-36 sequence by large insertional elements, the insertion of two amino acids in a very crucial part of this protein, and the presence of a premature stop codon in one isolate might have rendered this protein incomplete and non-functional. The study also demonstrated that more than one type of clone was responsible for this reported apparent outbreak and that ST29, a clone not reported from this region before, was the major clone responsible.",T {Uz Zaman} and M Aldrees and S M {Al Johani} and M Alrodayyan and F A Aldughashem and H H Balkhy,1201-9712,Int J Infect Dis,",*Disease Outbreaks,Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology,Bacterial,Bacterial Outer Membrane Proteins/chemistry,Bacterial/genetics,Carbapenem resistance,Carbapenems/*pharmacology,Drug Resistance,Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases,Genes,Genetic Variation,Humans,Klebsiella Infections/*epidemiology/*microbiology,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Klebsiella pneumoniae infection,Klebsiella pneumoniae/*drug effects/genetics/isola,Multiple,OXA 48 gene,Outer membrane protein,Saudi Arabia,Tertiary Care Centers,amikacin,antibiotic resistance,article,bacterium isolate,beta lactamase TEM 1,beta-Lactamases/*genetics,carbapenem,cefepime,cefotaxime,ceftazidime,ciprofloxacin,clinical article,controlled study,gene,gene mutation,gene sequence,genetic variability,gentamicin,human,multilocus sequence typing,piperacillin,piperacillin plus tazobactam,prematurity,stop codon,tertiary care center,transposon",e186--e192,"{Multi-drug carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae infection carrying the OXA-48 gene and showing variations in outer membrane protein 36 causing an outbreak in a tertiary care hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia}",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l601592827 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2014.05.021 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=18783511{\&}id=doi:10.1016{\%}2fj.ijid.2014.05.021{\&}atitle=multi-drug+c,28,2014,NA,"from duplicate 2 (multi-drug carbapenem-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae infection carrying the oxa-48 gene and showing variations in outer membrane protein 36 causing an outbreak in a tertiary care hospital in riyadh, saudi arabia - uz zaman, t; aldrees, m; al johani, s m; alrodayyan, m; aldughashem, f a; balkhy, h h)

Methods: Data from the OLV hospital, a 939-bed, university-affiliated teaching hospital in Belgium, were used. The study period ran from 2006 to 2009. All respiratory tract samples, positive for MRSA, were retrospectively collected from the automated microbiology database. As multiple samples per patient were available during follow-up, only the first MRSA respiratory tract sample was considered. Of all patients with MRSA positive respiratory tract samples, the complete medical records, including chest X-ray or chest CT scans were reviewed by a pulmonologist. Patients were defined to have pneumonia according to the ECDC criteria. Risk factors such as comorbidity and previous use of antibiotics were studied. Results: During follow-up, 197 patients with a MRSA positive respiratory tract sample were identified. 46 of these 197 patients developed an MRSA pneumonia of which 30 had a nosocomial pneumonia. The overall incidence of MRSA pneumonia was 0.49/10000 patient days. 25 of the 46 MRSA pneumonia were detected at ICU. In patients with MRSA pneumonia, the mortality was high, 24 of the 46 patients (52{\%}) died during follow-up versus 32{\%} in patients with MRSA colonization of the respiratory tract was 32{\%}. The mean time from admission to MRSA pneumonia was 13.6 days. 50{\%} of patients with MRSA pneumonia were previously (during current hospital admission) treated with an antibiotic vs 32.5{\%} in MRSA colonized patients.

Most cases of human infection have involved Rhodococcus equi, a natural zoonotic pathogen causing pneumonia in young foals. The human population at risk mainly includes immunocompromised patients. Infection of immunocompetent hosts has been rare, with less than 30 reported cases in the literature. The authors report a first case of recurrent Rhodococcus gordoniae granulomatous lower eyelid infection that occurred after an immunocompetent 44-year-old woman underwent a combined intranasal and lower blepharoplasty procedure. A literature search revealed only 10 reported cases of non-R. equi rhodococcal infections, most involving traumatic inoculation; 5 of these cases involved the eye and ocular adnexa. To the author's knowledge, this is the first case report of a non-R. equi rhodococcal infection of the eyelids. Identification of Rhodococcus by most laboratories is difficult, and in this case, 2 of 3 cultures were misidentified prior to definitive testing at a specialized laboratory.

21980,yes,voulgari2014,article,"OBJECTIVES: Despite the fact that the NDM-1 carbapenemase has successfully disseminated worldwide, outbreaks remain uncommon in the European region. We describe the characteristics of the first outbreaks caused by NDM-1-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae clonal isolates in Greece. METHODS: Between January 2010 and June 2013, 132 non-repetitive carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates, which gave a positive modified Hodge test and were phenotypically suspected of metallo-beta-lactamase production, were recovered from patients hospitalized at Ioannina University Hospital. Resistance genes were identified by PCR and sequencing. Plasmid profiling, conjugation experiments, enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus PCR, PFGE and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) were performed. Patient records were retrieved to access patterns of acquisition. RESULTS: Molecular testing verified the presence in 78 K. pneumoniae isolates, collected from 71 patients, of the blaNDM-1 gene. The blaCTX-M-15, blaOXA-1 and blaTEM-1 genes were also present in most isolates. The blaNDM-1 gene was located on a narrow host range IncFII-type plasmid, of approximately 95 kb, flanked upstream by a non-truncated ISAba125 element and downstream by the bleMBL gene. Genotyping clustered all K. pneumoniae isolates into a single clonal type with one subtype and MLST assigned them to sequence type 11. Two outbreaks were noted, the first between November and December 2011 involving four patients and the second initiated in May 2012 and ongoing, involving the remaining patients. All but two cases were characterized as hospital acquired. No links to immigration or travel history to endemic areas were established. CONCLUSIONS: This survey highlights the successful undetected dissemination of yet another carbapenemase in Greece and strengthens the hypothesis of a latent NDM-1 cluster in the Balkan region.",E Voulgari and C Gartzonika and G Vrioni and L Politi and E Priavali and S Levidiotou-Stefanou and A Tsakris,"1460-2091

22207,maybe,wang2014o,article,"Objective: This study aimed to investigate the clinical and microbiological features of recurrent group B streptococcal (GBS) diseases among non-pregnant adults. Methods: All hospitalized non-pregnant adults who had culture-proven GBS infections between January 2008 and December 2010 were enrolled in this retrospective study. Bacterial isolates were examined for their serotypes, genotypes, and antimicrobial resistance. Results: The recurrence rate of GBS infection in Taiwan was found to be 9.3{\%}. Of the 70 recurrent episodes in 32 patients, infections of the urinary tract (U) were diagnosed clinically in 55.7{\%}, infections of the soft tissue (S) in 31.4{\%}, and infections of the bloodstream (B) in 12.9{\%}. The initial/recurrent episodes in 25 patients were mainly U/U (40.6{\%}), followed by S/S (18.8{\%}) and B/B (6.2{\%}). The serotypes/serogroups identified were serotypes V (34.3{\%}), Ib (22.9{\%}), VI (17.1{\%}), III (12.9{\%}), IV (7.1{\%}), and Ia (5.7{\%}). Recurrent strains showed less resistance to erythromycin or clindamycin than non-recurrent strains. Six distinct genotypes were identified in 12 serotype VI isolates derived from seven patients; five of these isolate pairs had identical genotypes. Conclusions: Recurrent GBS diseases were found to occur considerably more often than previously thought, mainly in adults with a high comorbid index. Relapse, not new acquisition, was found to be more common. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.",Y H Wang and H M Chen and Y H Yang and T H Yang and C H Teng and C L Chen and C Chu and C H Chiu,1201-9712,Int J Infect Dis,",*Streptococcus agalactiae/classification/drug effe,Adult,Aged,Antimicrobial resistance,Bacterial,Charlson Comorbidity Index,Drug Resistance,Female,Genotype,Group B streptococci,Humans,Male,Middle Aged,Recurrence,Recurrent,Retrospective Studies,Serogroup,Serotype,Serotyping,Streptococcal Infections/*diagnosis/*microbiology,Taiwan,adult,antibiotic resistance,antibiotic sensitivity,antimicrobial therapy,article,bacteremia,bacterium culture,bloodstream infection,cephalosporin derivative,clindamycin,clinical feature,diabetes mellitus,diabetic patient,erythromycin,female,genotype,group B streptococcal infection,human,lincosamide,macrolide,major clinical study,male,microbiology,mikamycin B,penicillin derivative,peptic ulcer,phenotype,prevalence,purification,recurrence risk,recurrent infection,retrospective study,risk factor,serotype,soft tissue infection,urinary tract infection",e140--e145,{Clinical and microbiological characteristics of recurrent group B streptococcal infection among non-pregnant adults},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l373727517 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2014.05.026 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=18783511{\&}id=doi:10.1016{\%}2fj.ijid.2014.05.026{\&}atitle=clinical+and,26,2014,NA,"from duplicate 1 (clinical and microbiological characteristics of recurrent group b streptococcal infection among non-pregnant adults - wang, y h; chen, h m; yang, y h; yang, t h; teng, c h; chen, c l; chu, c; chiu, c h)

22463,maybe,wibbenmeyer2008,article,"Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), particularly USA300, is a major pathogen in the outpatient setting. We suspected that USA300 had been introduced into our burn-trauma unit (BTU) when three burn patients presented with numerous simultaneous abscesses. We did molecular typing on 206 MRSA isolates from all patients on the BTU who had MRSA isolated from either nares cultures or clinical specimens obtained between April 11, 2002 and October 24, 2006. We reviewed medical records for all patients who had USA300 and for 75 control patients. Twenty-five of 206 (12.1{\%}) patients who were colonized (n = 3) or infected (n = 22) with MRSA had USA300. Thirteen patients had abscesses drained surgically and eight had necrotizing fasciitis excised. Seven patients had burns (mean burn size 11.8 +/- 3.4{\%}), of who four (66.7{\%}) acquired numerous simultaneous (3-33) abscesses. Fourteen patients acquired USA300 outside of the BTU, and three acquired this strain on the BTU. Cases were more likely to have been hospitalized or to have had an operation in the 6 months before they were hospitalized than were controls (P = .001 for both). To our knowledge, this is the first study to describe numerous simultaneous MRSA abscesses in burn patients. The MRSA strain USA300 may be introduced onto burn units from the community by patients admitted with skin and soft tissue infections, especially abscesses and necrotizing fasciitis. Burn patients may be at risk for numerous abscesses with USA300, because they have open wounds and their immune systems may be compromised.",L A Wibbenmeyer and G P Kealey and B A Latenser and D J Diekema and I M Williams and S L Coffman and P L Winokur and J S Kroeger and R W {Lewis 2nd} and L A Herwaldt,"1559-047x (print)

22913,maybe,yamamoto2013a,article,"Enterobacteriaceae, carrying the New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) gene (bla (NDM-1)), have emerged and posed a threat since 2006. In Japan, bla (NDM-1)-carrying Escherichia coli was first described in 2010. In this study, we characterized NDM-1-positive Klebsiella pneumoniae strain 419 in Japan, which was isolated from the urine of a 90-year-old Japanese patient who had never been to the Indian subcontinent. K. pneumoniae 419 belonged to ST42. It possessed a surface capsule (with untypeable capsular PCR types) and was resistant to serum killing. K. pneumoniae 419 cells were occasionally flagellated or piliated and autoaggregated. K. pneumoniae 419 was resistant to beta-lactams (including carbapenems), aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones, and was susceptible to imipenem (or biapenem), aztreonam, polymixin B, and colistin. It possessed at least eight plasmids; of those, a 74-kb plasmid (pKPJ1) of the replicon FIIA carried bla (NDM-1) and was conjugally transferred to E. coli strains, with a 71-kb transferable azithromycin-resistant (mphA (+)) plasmid of the replicon F (pKPJ2), as a large (145-kb) plasmid (pKPJF100) through a transposition event.

Antibiotic resistance to the class of carbapenem in patients with pneumonia caused by Klebsiella species is unusual. New studies report carbapenem resistance in patients with pneumonia caused by Klebsiella species.This article examines, retrospectively, antibiotic resistance in patients with community- and nosocomial-acquired pneumonia caused by Klebsiella species.The data of all patients with community- and nosocomial-acquired pneumonia caused by Klebsiella species were collected from the hospital charts at the HELIOS Clinic, Witten/Herdecke University, Wuppertal, Germany, within the study period 2004 to 2014. An antibiogram was created from all of the study patients with pneumonia caused by Klebsiella species. Sensitivity and resistance profiles were performed for the different antibiotics that have been consistently used in the treatment of patients with pneumonia caused by Klebsiella species. All demographic, clinical, and laboratory data of all of the patients with pneumonia caused by Klebsiella species were collected from the patients' records.During the study period of January 1, 2004, to August 12, 2014, 149 patients were identified with community- and nosocomial-acquired pneumonia affected by Klebsiella species.

Antibiotic susceptibility testing and phenotypic screening for ESBLs and MBLs were performed on 122 P. aeruginosa isolates collected in the period from January 2011 to March 2012. MICs were determined. ESBLs and MBLs genes were sought by PCR. The resistant rate to imipenem was 39.34{\%}. The resistance rates for P. aeruginosa to cefuroxime, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, aztreonam, and piperacillin/tazobactam were 87.7{\%}, 80.3{\%}, 60.6{\%}, 45.1{\%}, and 25.4{\%}, respectively.

Between July and September 2012, a CTX-M-15 producing K. pneumoniae caused an outbreak in a university hospital in the Netherlands. The outbreak isolates were characterized and assigned to a novel sequence type (ST1427). An epidemiological link between affected patients was supported by patient contact tracing and whole-genome phylogenetic analysis. Intra-strain polymorphism was detected among multiple isolates obtained from different body sites of the index patient, which may relate to antibiotic treatment and/or host adaptation. Environmental contamination caused by the outbreak clone was found in the patient rooms even on medical equipment. The novel clone was not closely related to any known endemic/epidemic clone, but carried a set of a plasmid-borne resistance genes [blaCTX-M-15, blaTEM-1, blaOXA-1, aac(6')-Ib-cr, qnrB1, tetA(A), aac(3)-II]. Analysis of its virulence factors revealed a previously uncharacterized capsular biosynthesis region and two uncharacterized fimbriae gene clusters, and suggested that the new clone was not hypervirulent.

Nasopharyngeal carriage of Neisseria meningitidis is a precursor to disease; however, the majority of carriers do not develop disease. Household and other close contacts of persons with meningococcal disease have a higher risk for carriage and therefore invasive disease. These persons should receive antibiotic chemoprophylaxis to eliminate nasopharyngeal carriage of N. meningitidis as soon as possible. The rate of secondary disease for close contacts is highest immediately after onset of disease in the index patient; secondary cases rarely occur after 14 days. Ciprofloxacin, a second-generation fluoroquinolone, is an effective single-dose oral chemoprophylaxis agent. Although isolated cases of ciprofloxacin-resistant meningoccocal disease have been described in Argentina, Australia, China, France, India, and Spain, resistance has not been reported in North America. This report describes a cluster of three cases of fluoroquinolone-resistant meningococcal disease that occurred among residents of the border area of North Dakota and Minnesota during January 2007-January 2008.

274,yes,ahmed2016a,article,"Background: It is important and rather need of the hour to unravel the risk of antimicrobial resistance from a public health perspective in high burden countries such as India. The clinical significance of isolating multi-drug resistant (MDR) E. coli from hospitalized patients merits sustained attention. The objective of this study was to describe the evolution of antibiotic resistance and to gather evidence on spread of antimicrobial resistance by clonal expansion of clinical E. coli lineages. Methods {\&} Materials: A collection of 426 E. coli isolates was analysed as three subsequent batches from two tertiary care hospitals in India. The isolates were characterized by ERIC-based fingerprinting, O typing, phylogenetic grouping, MLST, virulence profiling, phenotypic and genotypic antimicrobial resistance analysis and whole genome sequence (WGS) analysis. Our integrated data were representative of a larger study aimed at understanding transmission dynamics, population genetic structure and shaping of antimicrobial resistance mechanisms in extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC). Results: We found that the resistance to unrelated antimicrobials is rapidly emerging in the form of ESBL-MDR phenotypes (58{\%}). The molecular epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance has undergone a rapid change over the course of our study with increase in ESBL, MDR and MBL rates from 31{\%}, 50{\%} and 0{\%} to 86{\%}, 95{\%} and 28{\%} respectively, as observed among the isolates studied in 2009 and 2012. Also the faecal E. coli isolates (37{\%}) exhibited the acquisition of new ESBL variants such as CTX-M-15 instead of the classical TEM and SHV types. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that groups B2 and A were prevalent among clinical E. coli isolates (49{\%} and 27{\%} respectively). REP-PCR, MLST and PFGE analyses suggest that ExPEC strains are undergoing a sub-clonal evolution as demonstrated by the identification of ST131 E. coli in our collection (42{\%}). E. coli ST131 was initially identified to be linked to the spread of fluoroquinolone resistance and CTX-M-15 extended-spectrum $\beta$- lactamase (ESBL) production. Alarmingly, ST131 strains harbouring NDM-1 (1.5{\%}) carbapenem resistance were also identified. Conclusion: This study suggests that clinical E. coli from India are strongly associated with CTX-M-15 enzyme and are clonally evolving with a potential for newer acquisitions and wide spread dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genes.",N Ahmed,1201-9712,International Journal of Infectious Diseases,"Escherichia coli,India,antibiotic resistance,antiinfective agent,carbapenem,clonal evolution,enzyme,extended spectrum beta lactamase,extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli,gene,genome,hospital patient,human,infection,molecular epidemiology,penicillinase,phenotype,phylogeny,population dynamics,population genetic structure,public health,risk,sequence analysis,tertiary care center,virulence",210,"{Tracking the emergence of multidrug resistant, extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli in India}",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l72245432 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2016.02.479 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=12019712{\&}id=doi:10.1016{\%}2fj.ijid.2016.02.479{\&}atitle=tracking+the+,45,2016,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,yes,allison,yes,nchedo,nchedo,zach,yes,zm_7.csv,NA,NA,zm_7_1.mex,yes,journal

Serogroups G and D were disseminated both in patients from the community and from the pediatric hospital, with group G prevalent among outpatient children. All strains were susceptible to vancomycin and metronidazole but high levels of resistance to clindamycin were found, especially among serogroups G and D.

743,maybe,amsaveni2010,article,"Drug resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa is rapidly increasing in hospitalized patients. A prospective study on various clinical isolates, from patients admitted from various parts of Coimbatore was conducted to ascertain the prevalence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. Prevalence of drug resistant isolates was estimated by screening with anti-pseudomonal antibiotics, genderwise and hospital wardwise. Among 750 samples processed 95 were confirmed for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The highest rate of infection due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa was observed in ICU's and general internal ward. Genderwise prevalence showed 62{\%} males and 37{\%} females were infected by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The highest percentage of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were observed in pus (40{\%}) and urine (32{\%}) samples. The results showed that antimicrobial resistance among Pseudomonas aeruginosa has increased for most anti-pseudomonal agents, such as amoxyclave(96.84{\%}), ceftriaxone(95{\%}), ceftazidime (71{\%}) and ticarrillin (76{\%}). Amikacin, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, meropenem, tobramycin, piperacillin and gentamycin are the drugs of choice for treatment, but in the near future the antimicrobial agents may lose their efficacy because of the spread of resistant organism due to indiscriminate use of antibiotics, lack of awareness, patient noncompliance and unhygienic conditions. Etiologic shifts in nosocomial infections and an upsurge of antimicrobial resistance among these pathogens are impressive and alarming.

We initiated a prospective study to follow all cases of CRKP as well as the active surveillance of patients in areas where cases were identified. We also conducted a retrospective review of the microbiology database for any missed cases of CRKP. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was conducted for the available CRKP isolates. During March 2010, a cluster of eight CRKPs was detected primarily in the adult intensive care unit (ICU). Patients with CRKPs were put under strict contact isolation, along with appropriate infection control measures. A retrospective review of K. pneumoniae isolates over the previous 6 months revealed two more CRKPs. The PFGE results during the outbreak period showed that the majority of strains were genetically indistinguishable or closely related. The majority of patients had prolonged hospital stay (91{\%}), indwelling devices (81{\%}), surgical procedures (74{\%}), carbapenem use (62{\%}), and colonization/infection with other multiple drug-resistant organisms (MDROs) (57{\%}).

Methods: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by Etest and microdilution according to CLSI guidelines. Resistance genes and their genetic environment were characterized by Check-points CT102 array and by PCR-sequencing. Plasmids were extracted by Kieser method, typed by PCR-based replicon typing and transferred by mating-out assays and transformation. VIM-31 was cloned in pET-28a and purified by ion-exchange chromatography and gel filtration. Kinetic parameters of VIM-31 were determined against various beta-lactams and a 3D homology model was constructed using EsyPred3D server. Results: A CNSE isolate (Eclo11236) was recovered from several blood cultures of an 87-year old female who underwent colectomy for intestinal adenocarcinoma and who subsequently developed a rectovaginal fistula and secondary peritonitis. Eclo11236 was intermediately susceptible to imipenem (IMI) (MIC = 3 $\mu$g/mL) and resistant to ertapenem (MIC = 6 $\mu$g/mL) while remaining susceptible to meropenem (MIC = 0.5 $\mu$g/mL), aztreonam, tigecycline, amikacin and ciprofloxacin. The presence of an MBL in this isolate was evidenced by a positive double disc synergy test with imipenem (IMI) and EDTA; the patient gradually improved following treatment with ciprofloxacin, but she remained persistently colonized with the same Eclo11236 in urine. PCR-sequencing revealed a new blaVIM-31 allele coding two Tyr224His and His252Arg mutations in comparison to VIM-2 and located upstream to aacA4' gene in a class 1 integron (In669) carried on a 42-kb not-typeable but transferable plasmid. VIM-31 presents a broad-spectrum activity, affecting all beta-lactam compounds except aztreonam. Comparatively to VIM-2, VIM-31 exhibits a lower catalytic activity (lower kcat and higher Km values) against beta-lactams with kcat/Km ratios ranging from 4.5 (ceftazidime), 900 (ampicillin), 1900 (cefotaxime) to 2400/mM/s (imipenem). Conclusion: We described here a new VIM-31 variant with 2 point mutations leading to modifications of its catalytic properties in comparison to VIM-2. The fact that this VIM-31-expressing E. cloacae isolate was detected in a patient who had not traveled abroad and who remained colonized after hospital discharge underlines the risk of silent spread of CNSE in the community.",P Bogaerts and C Bebrone and W Bouchahrouf and T D Huang and Y DeGheldre and K Hoffman and Y Glupczynski,1198-743x,Clinical Microbiology and Infection,"Enterobacter cloacae,adenocarcinoma,allele,amikacin,ampicillin,antibiotic sensitivity,assay,aztreonam,beta lactam,blood culture,carbapenem,cefotaxime,ceftazidime,ciprofloxacin,colon resection,community,edetic acid,environment,epsilometer test,ertapenem,female,gel filtration,gene,hospital,hospital discharge,human,imipenem,infection,integron,ion exchange chromatography,kinetics,mating,meropenem,microbiology,model,mutation,patient,peritonitis,pet animal,plasmid,point mutation,rectovaginal fistula,replicon,risk,tigecycline,urine",312,{Detection and characterisation of a new VIM-31 variant in Enterobacter cloacae},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l70822966 http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-0691.2012.03802.x http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=1198743x{\&}id=doi:10.1111{\%}2fj.1469-0691.2012.03802.x{\&}atitle=d,18,2012,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,maybe,cale,yes,zach,zach,zach,yes,zm_7.csv,NA,NA,zm_7_1.mex,yes,journal

Four hundred and ten CA-MRSA isolates were prospectively collected and screened for the presence of Panton-Valentin leucocidin (PVL) and toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST-1) encoding genes, while clinical information were recorded. PVL- and TSST-1-positive isolates were genotyped by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) type, spa type and multilocus sequence type (MLST) were determined on representative isolates. One hundred and fifty-nine (39 {\%}) isolates were PVL-positive. PVL-positive isolates were significantly more frequently isolated from skin or soft tissue than PVL-negative isolates, causing mainly subcutaneous abscesses and furuncles. Patients with PVL-positive CA-MRSA were significantly younger than patients with PVL-negative CA-MRSA. Eighty-seven percent of the PVL-positive isolates belonged to a limited number (n = 7) of PFGE types belonging to sequence types (ST) ST80, ST8, ST30, ST5, ST152, ST338 and a new ST, a single-locus variant of ST1. A temporal evolution of the distribution of these PFGE types was observed, characterised by (1) the dissemination of the ST8-SCCmecIV arcA-positive (USA300) genotype and (2) a genetic diversification. Forty-seven (11 {\%}) strains were TSST-1-positive, of which 65 {\%} clustered into four PFGE types, all belonging to ST5.

5225,maybe,diene2013,article,"Clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa exhibiting high-level resistance to carbapenems were recovered from a French patient with cystic fibrosis (CF) who had not received carbapenem therapy. This study was conducted to investigate the molecular mechanism conferring the carbapenem-resistant phenotype in clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa recovered from the same CF patient chronically colonised since 2005. Investigation of imipenem resistance of P. aeruginosa strain{\_}02 isolated in May 2011 showed no carbapenemase activity. However, amplification and sequencing of the oprD porin gene revealed disruption of this gene by an insertion sequence (IS) element of 1337 bp that contained a novel transposase of 1227 bp (ISPa46) bordered by two terminal imperfect inverted repeats of 28 bp, which was associated with carbapenem resistance. Retrospective analysis of five additional strains of P. aeruginosa isolated before May 2011 from the same patient revealed that all isolates were likely to be the same clone by multilocus sequence typing analysis (ST540/551), but one of the five isolates was imipenem-susceptible. Although it was possible to demonstrate the presence of ISPa46 in all strains by PCR, this IS was transposed in the oprD gene only for imipenem-resistant isolates. Therefore, this study reports a novel IS element (ISPa46) in P. aeruginosa clinical isolates of a CF patient in Marseille, France, that was associated with carbapenem resistance and was selected in the absence of carbapenem treatment.",S M Diene and T L'Homme and S Bellulo and N Stremler and J C Dubus and L Mely and S Leroy and N Degand and J M Rolain,"0924-8579

CPE have not been reported from Curacao. However, recently intercontinental spread was suggested of a KPC carbapenemase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae in a patient in the United Kingdom with previous admission to a hospital in Curacao in 2009.Findings: After the introduction of the CLSI 2010 revised breakpoints, seven patients with carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae were found in a general hospital in Curacao over a period of 16Â months. Four patients carried KPC-2 positive Klebsiella pneumoniae, ST11. Two patients carried KPC-3 positive Klebsiella pneumoniae ST258 and one patient carried a KPC-3 positive Citrobacter freundii. Furthermore, our Klebsiella pneumoniae KPC-2 ST11 strain was matched to the Klebsiella pneumoniae KPC-2 ST11 strain in the United Kingdom.Conclusions: Introduction of new laboratory methods, and adoption of new guidelines and breakpoints led to the first detection of CPE in Curacao.

7587,maybe,gotting2015,article,"Introduction: Although the prevalence of carbapenemase-producing Acinetobacter baumannii (CP-AB) in Germany is still low an increasing number of outbreaks has been reported in recent years. In August 2014 we observed a cluster of 4 patients with CP-AB (OXA-23) on our surgical intensive care unit (SICU). Objectives: After excluding an environmental source we performed epidemiological analyses to gain insight into the spread of CP-AB in our university hospital. Methods: To characterize the CP-AB isolates molecular typing using amplified fragment length polymorphism was conducted. A genotypic comparison with strains collected in 2013 and the first half of 2014 was carried out. All new patient isolates of CP-AB were genotyped prospectively. Results: Molecular typing revealed that 3 out of the 4 SICU-isolates were genotypically identical. Although temporally and locally coinciding, the 4th isolate of the patient cluster did not match.This 4th strain however was identical to a strain previously identified in a patient from the neurological department in July 2014. A physical link between these two patients could not be identified. Even more surprisingly, another isolate of CB-AB from a neurosurgical patient isolated in September 2014 was found to be identical with the three isolates of the SICU cluster, despite the absence of detectable temporal or local link to the SICU. Conclusion: Isolates of CP-AB from six patients fell into two clusters of two and four strains, respectively. In this case patient transfer within the hospital cannot explain these unexpected genotypical relationships between isolates from three departments. Transmission of CP-AB may have occurred in the context of consultants' visits or when patients were temporarily moved to a diagnostic unit such as endoscopy or radiology. In the context of clusters of CP-AB isolated from several patients, genotyping provides the opportunity to follow the movement of these highly resistant bacteria within a hospital. Surprising genotyping results should engender efforts to analyse the pathways of transmission.",T GÃ¶tting and W Ebner and D Jonas and A Serr and G HÃ¤cker and M Dettenkofer,2047-2994,Antimicrobial Resistance and Infection Control,"Acinetobacter baumannii,Germany,amplified fragment length polymorphism,bacterium,carbapenemase,consultation,diagnosis,endoscopy,genotype,hospital,human,infection control,intensive care unit,molecular typing,neurosurgery,patient,patient transport,prevalence,prevention,radiology,university hospital",NA,{Carbapenemase-producing Acinetobacter baumannii in a surgical intensive care unit-take time for tracking},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l72039077 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=20472994{\&}id=doi:{\&}atitle=carbapenemase-producing+acinetobacter+baumannii+in+a+surgical+intensive+care+unit-take,4,2015,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,maybe,cale,no,brooke,allison,zach,yes,zm_7.csv,NA,NA,zm_7_1.mex,yes,journal

METHODS: Between January 2000 and July 2001, a case-finding study was performed in 13 Zambian prisons for pulmonary TB. Prisoners were administered a questionnaire to obtain demographic information. Information regarding housing density and diet was also collected. Three consecutive first morning sputum specimens were cultured for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Antimicrobial resistance testing was performed by the resistance ratio method. RESULTS: A total of 1080 prisoners were recruited: 1055 were males and 25 females. Sputum from 245 (22.7{\%}) prisoners yielded M. tuberculosis, including 168 (15.6{\%}) with smear-positive disease. Based on a total prison population of 6118, the minimal prevalence of TB was 4.0{\%}. There was a linear relationship between the proportion of prisoners evaluated and the prevalence of TB (R(2) = 0.9366) across facilities, suggesting that the true prevalence of TB may approach 15-20{\%}. Resistance to at least one anti-tuberculosis drug was detected for 40 (23.8{\%}) isolates, while MDR-TB was identified for 16 (9.5{\%}) isolates.

8181,yes,hamprecht2013,article,"OBJECTIVES: To characterize the mechanisms involved in reduced susceptibility to carbapenems in two Enterobacter cloacae clinical isolates. METHODS: Two E. cloacae isolates recovered from different regions in Germany and showing reduced susceptibility to carbapenems were analysed. Susceptibility testing, conjugation, transformation assays, plasmid analysis, sequencing and molecular typing using rep-PCR were performed. RESULTS: The two clinical isolates carried the bla(GIM-1) gene and showed resistance to ertapenem, with variable MIC values of imipenem and meropenem. The isolates were clonally unrelated. The bla(GIM-1) gene was located on self-transferable and non-typeable plasmids. Both isolates harboured distinct plasmids and integron structures containing the bla(GIM-1) gene cassette. Interestingly, one of the two plasmids was able to replicate in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, demonstrating its broad host range. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first identification in E. cloacae of the bla(GIM-1) gene, which is responsible for reduced susceptibility to carbapenems. We showed that this gene, previously identified in P. aeruginosa, was located in a different genetic background in E. cloacae.

Methods: Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by disc diffusion and broth microdilution according to CLSI guidelines. Double-disk synergy test was performed in order to screen for ESBLs/pAmpC beta-lactamases. PCR was used to detect bla ESBL/bla ampC/bla carb genes. Genetic relatedness of the strains was determined by pulsed-field-gel-electrophoresis (PFGE). Results: Among 85 patients with UTIs caused by ESBL producing isolates, 44 (51.8{\%}) were from in-patients and 41 (48.2{\%}) from outpatients. Klebsiella spp. was the most frequently isolated from in-patients, in 28 (63.6{\%}) cases.

Methods: Four K. pneumoniae isolates, (A2, B1, B2, B6), recovered in March and April 2011 from two intensive care unit (ICU) patients in a General hospital located in a seaside resort of Uruguay, were analysed. Bacterial identification and susceptibility testing were performed using Vitek 2 GN and AST-N082-card and E-test (bioM{\'{e}}rieux{\textregistered}). Phenotypic confirmation for KPCs and Metallo-b-Lactamases were performed with the KPC plus MBL confirm ID Kit (ROSCO{\textregistered}). CDC protocol for rectal cultures.The presence of blaKPC, blaIMP and blaVIM, was determined by PCR and further sequencing. Isoelectrofocusing was performed using the PhastSystem and commercial PhastaGels IEF 3-9. The genetic relatedness was evaluated by PFGE using XbaI and MLST. Population analysis and investigation of the stability of meropenem (MEM) heteroresistance were done on isolates B1 and B6, recovered from pre and post antibiotic treatment, respectively. A set of infection control measures and root cause analysis were done. Results and discussion: All isolates showed a multiresistant phenotype including to colistin but susceptibility to tigecycline. B6 exhibited MEM MICs higher ({\textgreater}32 $\mu$g/mL) than the initial isolate B1 (8 $\mu$g/mL) and also higher MICs to other antibiotic classes. All isolates produced a KPC-2 enzyme with an isoelectric point of 6.7. Their macro-restriction pattern were indistinguishable and A2 isolate belonged to the internationally spread ST258 KPC-Kp clone (Table 1). B1 and B6 isolates represented a heterogeneous and homogeneous MEM resistant population, respectively. Health authorities were notified. Control measures were extended contact isolation; screening of contacts and pre-emptive isolation; close the ICU to new patients; reinforce environmental hygiene. No new cases were detected up to September 2011. (Table Presented) Conclusions: The first KPC-Kp outbreak was detected in Uruguay. A novel K. pneumoniae resistance behaviour was observed after antibiotic therapy, suggesting the selection of not only a MEM resistant homogeneous subpopulation with higher b-lactams MICs but also exhibiting resistance to other antibiotic classes.

9630,yes,jeannot2011,article,"Objectives: Pseudomonas aeruginosa may become highly resistant to carbapenems and almost all b-lactam antibiotics by horizontal transfer of metallo-b-lactamase genes (MBLs). To date, 6 types of MBLs (IMP, VIM, SPM, GIM, AIM et DIM) have been reported in this organism. This study describes a novel IMP-type enzyme produced by two P. aeruginosa clinical strains collected at the teaching hospital of BesancÂ¸on (France). Methods: Strains 10266 and 10298 were isolated from a rectal screening sample and a blood culture of two patients admitted in 2010, respectively. Drug susceptibility testing, strain genotyping by PFGE, MBL production, PCR amplification, cloning and sequencing experiments were performed according to standard protocols. Results: Double disc synergy tests using imipenem and EDTA indicated MBL production in these two genotypically related strains only susceptible to aztreonam and colistin. A gene encoding an enzyme distantly related to IMP-8 (identity {\textless}70{\%}) and referred to as IMP-29 was amplified by PCR and sequenced. In strain 10298, blaIMP-29 was located in a typical class 1 integron downstream of gene cassettes aacA4 et dfrII. The genetic environment of blaIMP-29 appeared to be very different in 10266 as the gene lied alone with the P2 promoter of intL1 on a transferable plasmid of 20 kb. Interestingly, the PU21 tranconjugants were susceptible to piperacillin (MIC = 8 mg/mL), of intermediate susceptibility to imipenem (8 mg/mL) and higly resistant to meropenem (â¥128 mg/mL), doripenem (64 mg/mL), ceftazidime (â¥128 mg/mL) and ticarcillin (â¥128 mg/mL). A second class 1 integron harboring gene blaPSE-1 flanked by gene cassettes aacA4 and aadA2 was detected in the two strains. Finally, the presence of a stop codon in gene oprD accounted for the high level resistance to imipenem in both isolates. Conclusion: This new transferable MBL identified in France provides P. aeruginosa with an atypical MBL resistance phenotype which can be misidentified when additional resistance mechanisms are present (penicillinase PSE-1, loss of porin OprD).

In this study, we describe the characteristics of the outbreak-related blaNDM-1-producing K. pneumonia isolates in a neonatal unit in Shandong province, China. We recovered 21 non-repetitive carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates with a positively modified Hodge test (MHT) or EDTA synergistic test from patients and environmental samples in Shandong provincial hospital. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) data show K. pneumoniae isolates from 19 patients were clonally related and belong to the clonal groups ST20 and ST17. We note two outbreaks, the first caused by ST20 during August 2012 involving four patients, and the second caused by ST20 and ST17 during January 2012 and September 2013 involving fourteen patients. We found the bed railing of one patient was the source of the outbreak. We verified the presence of the blaNDM-1 gene in 21 K. pneumoniae isolates. The genes blaCTX-M-15, blaCTX-M-14, blaDHA-1, blaTEM-1 and Class I integron were also present in 18 (85.7{\%}), 3 (14.3{\%}), 18 (85.7{\%}), 19 (90.5{\%}) and 19 (90.5{\%}) isolates, respectively. We also found an isolate with both blaNDM-1 and blaIMP-4. All of the isolates exhibited a multidrug-resistance phenotype. The beta-lactam resistance of 20 isolates was transferable via conjugation. In addition, we show the resistance of 21 K. pneumoniae isolates to carbapenem is not related to lack of outer-membrane proteins OmpK35 and OmpK36 nor overpression of efflux pumps.

Methods: A total of 200 isolates of P. aeruginosa which were obtained from various clinical samples were subjected to antibiotic susceptibility testing by the disc-diffusion method and their MICs were determined by the Vitek - 2 Automated Antimicrobial Identification and Susceptibility Testing System against imipenem, meropenem, ticarcillin, amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, tigecycline, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin/sulbactam, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefoperazone/sulbactam, cefepime, tetracycline, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone and colistin. Their MICs were also determined by the Etest method against imipenem, meropenem, piperacillin, tobramycin, ceftazidime, tigecycline and colistin. The presence of blaNDM-1 was detected by PCR and it was confirmed by sequencing the gene which was present in the isolates which exhibited carbapenem resistance. The experimental transferability of the plasmids which carried blaNDM-1 was determined by using E. coli J53 as the recipient.

METHODS: The descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted from May 2009 to June 2012 at the Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, and comprised non-duplicate clinical carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae isolates obtained from different collection units across Pakistan. Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion screening of carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae was confirmed by minimum inhibitory concentration using E-test. Polymerase chain reaction assay was performed to detect blaKPC, blaNDM-1, blaIMP, and blaVIM genes. In addition variable number tandem repeat typing was performed on selected cluster of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1-positive Klebsiella pneumoniae. RESULTS: Of the 114 carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae isolates, 104(94{\%}) tested positive for blaNDM-1 gene. At 68(66{\%}), Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most frequent species isolated, followed by E.coli 33(31{\%}).

Investigation was conducted in order to outline spatio-temporal distribution and genetic characterization of pAmpC-KP isolates in Hungary. Between December 2009 and December 2013, 312 consecutive KP clinical isolates were confirmed as producing pAmpCs. All isolates showed resistance to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones, and 77{\%} were non-susceptible to at least one carbapenem. Analysis of $\beta$-lactamase genes showed blaDHA-1 in all and additionally blaCTX-M-15 in 90{\%} of isolates. PFGE typing revealed 12 pulsotypes; of these, KP053 (262/312) and KP070 (38/312) belonged to sequence type ST11 and comprised 96{\%} of the isolates. The blaDHA-1 and blaCTX-M-15 coproducing KP053/ST11 clone affected 234 patients and spread to 55 healthcare centres across Hungary during the study period. Three KP053 isolates were also resistant to colistin. In two of these, the mgrB gene was truncated by IS10R, while in the third isolate, insertional inactivation of mgrB by ISKPn14 was identified. Hungary is the first European country showing endemic spread of blaDHA-1 facilitated by the international high-risk clone ST11.

Here, we report the cluster of linezolid- and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (LVRE) in a German department for hematologic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Methods: In this retrospective analysis we included all patients with LVRE in a university-based department for HSCT in 2014 and 2015. Patients chart reviews were used to investigate the epidemiology and clinical outcome. Available LVRE isolates underwent detailed microbiological characterization and genotyping by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Results: In total, 20 patients with LVRE were identified within the observed time period. All except two patients underwent allogeneic HSCT. Surveillance culture results from incoming patients and chart review revealed that 10 of 20 patients were colonized at hospital admission. Eight of 10 patients with in-hospital acquired LVRE had previous linezolid treatment. Analysis of spatio-temporal patterns showed no evidence for LVRE patient-to-patient or environment-to-patient transmission within the HSCT department. In five cases (25{\%}) LVRE bloodstream infection occurred. Nine LVRE isolates could be saved for characterization. Eight isolates carried vanA, one isolate vanB. PFGE analysis showed that four different LVRE clones were responsible for the cluster. One single genotype was present in six LVRE isolates whereupon the corresponding patients were all referred from the same hospital to the HSCT department. Conclusions: This is the first report demonstrating the emergence of LVRE in a German HSCT department. (L)VRE screening at patients' admission and appropriate infection control strategies were sufficient to prevent any transmission.

However, Nocardia species may sometimes cause an infection disease in immunocompetent hosts. Nocardia mexicana infections are the least common and are very rare. Case presentation: Herein, we report the first case of a pulmonary infection with N. mexicana in a 61-year-old Japanese woman with a history of hyperlipidaemia and bronchiectasis and a 6- month history of non-productive hacking cough. A sample of bronchial lavage fluid obtained by bronchofiberscopy showed filamentous branching gram-positive rods and acid-fast filamentous branching rods, and a colony of suspected Nocardia was cultured. Based on 16S rRNA, gyrB, rpoB, secA1 and hsp65 gene sequence analyses and biochemical and physiological properties, the strain was identified as N. mexicana. The strain was resistant to the antimicrobial agents amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, clarithromycin, minocycline, gentamycin, tobramycin, ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

METHODS: Two hundred and thirty-five ertapenem-non-susceptible (MIC {\textgreater}/= 0.5 mg/L) isolates of Enterobacteriaceae from the worldwide Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART) 2009 programme were screened using a multiplex PCR for the presence of bla(KPC), bla(OXA-48), bla(VIM) and bla(NDM-1) genes. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) and AmpC genes (bla(ESBL) and bla(AmpC)) were identified using the Check-MDR CT101 microarray. DNA sequencing was performed to identify the bla(ESBL), bla(KPC) and bla(NDM-1) genes. Molecular typing was also performed to genetically characterize these isolates. RESULTS: Sixty-six isolates (28{\%}) had a carbapenemase gene, with bla(NDM-1) identified in 33 isolates including 2 isolates carrying both bla(NDM-1) and bla(OXA-48); other carbapenemase genes found included bla(KPC) (n = 23), bla(VIM) (n = 7) and bla(OXA-48) (n = 3).

12754,maybe,ma2015d,article,"BACKGROUND: The importance of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) in Chinese hospitals is not clearly delineated. Thus we sought to assess the prevalence of MDRO in Chinese intensive care units (ICUs). METHODS: Prospective study of inpatients admitted consecutively to eight ICUs in four Chinese cities in 2009-10. Admission and weekly screenings were performed by using selective media for methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. For the two latters, resistance to ceftazidime defined MDRO. Backward logistic regression models were designed to assess factors independently associated with MDRO carriage on admission and MDRO acquisition within ICUs. RESULTS: 686 patients were included, and the MDRO prevalence rate on admission was 30.5 {\%} (32.7 {\%} for ESBL-positive Enterobacteriaceae, 3.2 {\%} for MRSA). Antibiotic treatment prior to ICU admission was independently associated with carriage on admission (OR: 1.4) in multivariate analysis.

The MDRO attack rate increased from 13.2 {\%} in the first week to 82.1 {\%} for ICU stay {\textgreater} 3 weeks. Duration of antibiotic exposure (OR: 1.16; 1.1-1.2) and prior antibiotic treatment before ICU (OR: 2.1; 1.1-3.3) were associated with MDRO acquisition in multivariate analysis. The MDRO prevalence rate on ICU discharge was 51.2 {\%} and the global prevalence density rate 71 per 1000 hospital-days. CONCLUSION: More than one out of two patients was MDRO carrier on ICU discharge in Chinese hospitals. This is the result of the combination of a high MDRO prevalence rate on ICU admission and a high MDRO acquisition rate within ICU.",X Ma and Y Wu and L Li and Q Xu and B Hu and Y Ni and A Wu and S Sun and V Jarlier and J Robert,1471-2334,BMC Infectious Diseases,",*Drug Resistance,80 and over,Acinetobacter,Acinetobacter/isolation {\&} purification,Adult,Aged,Bacterial,Child,China/epidemiology,Chinese,Cross Infection/microbiology,Enterobacteriaceae/isolation {\&} purification,Female,Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections/*epidemiology/m,Humans,Intensive Care Units/*statistics {\&} numerical data,Male,Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus/isolat,Middle Aged,Multiple,Prevalence,Prospective Studies,Pseudomonas aeruginosa,Pseudomonas aeruginosa/isolation {\&} purification,Staphylococcal Infections/*epidemiology/microbiolo,Young Adult,aged,aminoglycoside,antibiotic resistance,article,bacterium carrier,bacterium culture,beta-Lactam Resistance,carbapenem,ceftazidime,cephalosporin,child,drug use,extended spectrum beta lactamase producing Enterob,female,glycopeptide,hospital discharge,hospital patient,human,intensive care unit,length of stay,major clinical study,male,methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus,nonhuman,nose smear,penicillin derivative,prevalence,prospective study,quinolone derivative,treatment duration",358,{First multicenter study on multidrug resistant bacteria carriage in Chinese ICUs},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l605648549 http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12879-015-1105-7 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=14712334{\&}id=doi:10.1186{\%}2fs12879-015-1105-7{\&}atitle=first+multicen,15,2015,1,"from duplicate 1 (first multicenter study on multidrug resistant bacteria carriage in chinese icus - ma, x; wu, y; li, l; xu, q; hu, b; ni, y; wu, a; sun, s; jarlier, v; robert, j)

12905,maybe,majewski2014a,article,"BACKGROUND: The utility of carbapenems, which are considered 'last-line' agents, is being diminished by the growing incidence of various resistance mechanisms in bacteria. We aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism of carbapenem resistance in Enterobacter cloacae recovered from a 76-year-old patient who had undergone coronary artery bypass grafting and repair of the mitral and tricuspid valves. Interestingly, the patient had no prior history of hospital admission abroad. METHODS: The Carba-NP test II and synergy testing were performed to confirm carbapenemase activity. PCR was used to detect carbapenemase-encoding genes. Nucleotide and amino acid sequence analysis was performed to identify OXA-48 variants. Moreover, we performed multilocus sequence typing (MLST) of multidrug-resistant (MDR) E. cloacae. RESULTS: We detected no significant increase in zone diameter around disks with inhibitors. However, the Carba-NP test II revealed carbapenemase activity in all isolates. All isolates showed the presence of the exact OXA-48 carbapenemase variant. Furthermore, MLST analysis revealed that the MDR E. cloacae isolates belonged to ST89. CONCLUSIONS: We report a case of infection caused by a unique carbapenem-resistant E. cloacae ST89 producing OXA-48 carbapenemase. Interestingly, these pathogens developed resistance to other 'last-resort' agents, namely colistin and tigecycline. There is a crucial need for surveillance programs aimed at screening for carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacteria, especially in patients transferred from high-incidence areas.",P Majewski and P Wieczorek and P T Sacha and M Frank and G Juszczyk and D Ojdana and W Klosowska and A Wieczorek and A Sienko and A D Michalska and T Hirnle and E A Tryniszewska,1201-9712,Int J Infect Dis,"*Communicable Diseases, Emerging,Aged,Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology,Antimicrobial drug resistance,Bacterial Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics,Carbapenemase,Enterobacter cloacae,Enterobacter cloacae/classification/*genetics,Enterobacteriaceae Infections/diagnosis/*epidemiol,Humans,Infection control,Male,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Multilocus Sequence Typing,Oxa-48,Poland/epidemiology,beta-Lactam Resistance,beta-Lactamases/biosynthesis/*genetics",107--109,{Emergence of OXA-48 carbapenemase-producing Enterobacter cloacae ST89 infection in Poland},NA,25,2014,NA,"1878-3511

12931,maybe,malande2015,article,"Introduction Carbapenem Resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) infections are increasingly reported among adult patients, with very little described in paediatric population, with currently no reports describing this problem in the African Paediatric setting. Method This is a retrospective observational study that aimed at describing the emergence of CRE at Red Cross Children Hospital (RCWMCH), between 2012 and 2015. We identified CRE confirmed from cultured samples of patients at RCWMCH for the period 2012-March 2015. We analysed pharmacy records and case records from the hospital folders of identified patients together with antibiotic sensitivity and specific molecular typing and modified Hodge test results. Results The first CRE episode was an isolated case in November 2012. In May/June 2013, the Hospital prompted by a new CRE infection case, instituted screening exercise where 6 cases of colonization were found. Up to March 2015, there have been five other sporadic cases, bringing a total of 7 confirmed CRE infections, and 12 colonised cases. Of these 7 cases, 6 were female, 4 infants and 2 died. Two of the 7 cases had positive Hodge test; one had New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM), one Guiana Extended-Spectrum (GES) gene while five tested negative for carbapenemases. All 7 cases had previous carbapenem exposure, five of which received colistin monotherapy. We noted an increasing utilisation of carbapenems and colistin coinciding with this period of emerging carbapenem resistance. Conclusion The emergence of CRE is increasingly undermining the use of carbapenems. Early detection of CRE, with emphasis of the principles and practices of antibiotic stewardship is key to guiding infection control and treatment decisions and supporting surveillance efforts.",O O Malande and B Eley and C Bamford and A {Du Plessis},1015-8782,Southern African Journal of Epidemiology and Infection,"African,Enterobacteriaceae infection,adult,antibiotic agent,antibiotic sensitivity,carbapenem,carbapenem derivative,carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae,carbapenemase,city,colistin,exercise,exposure,female,gene,hospital,human,infant,infection,infection control,metallo beta lactamase,molecular typing,monotherapy,observational study,patient,pediatric hospital,pharmacy,population,red cross,screening,war",183--184,"{Emergence of carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae infection (CREI) at red cross war memorial children's hospital, Cape Town: 2012-2015}",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l72215110 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=10158782{\&}id=doi:{\&}atitle=emergence+of+carbapenem-resistant+enterobacteriaceae+infection+{\%}28crei{\%}29+at+red+cross,30,2015,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,yes,allison,no,mushtaq,zach,zach,no,zm_7.csv,could not find full-text,NA,NA,no,journal

14373,yes,moremi2016,article,"Introduction: The species Achromobacter animicus first described in 2013 has been isolated from sputum of humans suffering from respiratory infections. Literature regarding A. animicus is limited. Herein we document first case of A. animicus wound infections. Objective: To characterize a multidrug-resistant A. animicus isolated from chronic posttraumatic wound infection in a street child from African continent. Materials and Methods: Phenotypic identification of the organism was performed using gram staining, culture on Blood and MacConkey Agars and VITEK{\textregistered}-MS. Further taxonomic identification was done by sequencing of the complete 16S rRNA gene and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) of 7 housekeeping genes. Antimicrobial Susceptibility testing and extended spectrum beta lactamase production was confirmed using VITEK{\textregistered} 2 system and E-Test respectively. Result: The isolate was phenotypically identified as a gramnegative bacterium with inconclusive genus. The complete 16S rRNA gene provided 99.6{\%}, 99.6{\%} and 99.7{\%} match with Achromobacter xylosoxidans (CP014065), Achromobacter denitrificans (CP013923) and Achromobacter animicus (NR-117615) respectively. The MLST unveiled 4 new alleles, i.e. gltB-82, lepA-114, nrdA-99 and nuoL-92, that resulted into the new sequence type ST-320, which was closely related to other A. animicus genotypes. Single locus sequencing of nrdA-765 gene confirmed the isolate to be A. animicus. The isolate was found to be resistant to ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and tetracycline, but susceptible to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, imipenem, meropenem, and ertapenem, and intermediate susceptible to moxifloxacin. Conclusion: For the first time, this case report highlights the role of multidrug- resistant A. animicus in causing wound infections which is important information to clinicians and clinical microbiologist. There is a need to improve microbiological services in developing countries in order to identify uncommon human pathogens. This will assist in updating the database of automated identification systems; simplifying identification of these pathogens and track their epidemiology.",N Moremi and H Claus and M Hingi and U Vogel and S E Mshana,1618-0607,International Journal of Medical Microbiology,"Achromobacter xylosoxidans,Gram staining,RNA 16S,Tanzania,allele,ampicillin,antibiotic sensitivity,blood,case report,cefotaxime,ceftazidime,child,ciprofloxacin,cotrimoxazole,data base,developing country,doctor patient relation,endogenous compound,epsilometer test,ertapenem,extended spectrum beta lactamase,gene expression,genotype,gentamicin,genus,homelessness,housekeeping gene,human,imipenem,meropenem,microbiology,moxifloxacin,multilocus sequence typing,nonhuman,piperacillin plus tazobactam,tetracycline,wound infection",11,"{Multidrug-resistant Achromobacter animicus causing wound infection in a street child in Mwanza, Tanzania}",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l614104788 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmm.2016.11.008 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=16180607{\&}id=doi:10.1016{\%}2fj.ijmm.2016.11.008{\&}atitle=multidrug-re,306,2016,8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,maybe,cale,yes,ayomide,ayomide,zach,yes,zm_7.csv,NA,NA,zm_7_2.mex,yes,journal

15013,maybe,ngandjio2009,article,"There was an outbreak of cholera in Cameroon during 2004 and 2005; the epidemic began in Douala in January 2004 and spread throughout the south of the country. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported 8005 cases in 2004 and 2847 cases in 2005. Five hundred eighty-nine stool samples were received in the Pasteur Centre of Cameroon and 352 were microbiologically confirmed to be positive for Vibrio cholerae O1. Isolated strains were tested for their antimicrobial susceptibilities. All the strains were multidrug resistant and predominantly showed a common resistance pattern at the beginning of the outbreak. Tetracycline, recommended by the WHO for treating cholera in adults, was effective against all the strains tested. Cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole), previously a first-line treatment in children, was ineffective in vitro for all the clinical isolates and was quickly replaced by amoxicillin. Ampicillin resistance emerged at the end of 2004 and was the leading resistance pattern observed in the second half of 2005. This therefore represented the second major resistance pattern. These two major resistance profiles were not associated with patient characteristics (sex and age) or to the geographic origin of strains. However, there was a highly significant relationship between resistance patterns and the year of isolation (p {\textless} 0.001). The strains possessed genes ctxA and ctxB encoding the two cholera toxin subunits and were very closely related, irrespective of their antimicrobial resistance patterns. They were not differentiated by molecular typing methods and gave similar ribotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns.",A Ngandjio and M Tejiokem and M Wouafo and I Ndome and M Yonga and A Guenole and L Lemee and M L Quilici and M C Fonkoua,1535-3141,Foodborne Pathogens and Disease,",*Drug Resistance,Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology,Bacterial,Bacterial/*analysis,Cameroon,Cameroon/epidemiology,Cholera/epidemiology/*microbiology,Colony Count,DNA,Disease Outbreaks,Electrophoresis,Feces/microbiology,Food Microbiology,Gel,Humans,Microbial,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Multiple,Polymerase Chain Reaction,Pulsed-Field,Ribotyping,Vibrio cholerae,Vibrio cholerae O1/*drug effects/genetics/isolatio,antiinfective agent,article,bacterial DNA,bacterial count,cholera,drug effect,epidemic,feces,food control,genetics,human,isolation and purification,microbiological examination,microbiology,multidrug resistance,polymerase chain reaction,pulsed field gel electrophoresis,ribotyping",49--56,{Antimicrobial resistance and molecular characterization of Vibrio cholerae O1 during the 2004 and 2005 outbreak of cholera in Cameroon},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l355857159 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=15567125{\&}id=doi:{\&}atitle=antimicrobial+resistance+and+molecular+characterization+of+vibrio+cholerae+o1+during+,6,2009,1,"from duplicate 1 (antimicrobial resistance and molecular characterization of vibrio cholerae o1 during the 2004 and 2005 outbreak of cholera in cameroon - ngandjio, a; tejiokem, m; wouafo, m; ndome, i; yonga, m; guenole, a; lemee, l; quilici, m l; fonkoua, m c)

Serbia has been designated as an endemic region for isolates carrying the blaNDM-1 gene, as well as one of several commonly proposed countries of origin. This is the first report of NDM-1-positive Escherichia coli from Serbia. A carbapenem-resistant clinical isolate of E. coli strain IMD989, isolated from the blood culture of a pediatric patient with leukemia, was subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility tests, molecular typing, and conjugation experiments. The strain exhibited resistance to meropenem and was classified as a novel sequence type, ST5123, belonging to E. coli phylogenetic group A. ST5123 showed similarity to veterinary isolates ST93 and ST3977. The blaNDM-1 gene was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. Cloning and sequencing of genomic clones confirmed that strain IMD989 produces an NDM-1 variant. Conjugation experiments, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and Southern blot hybridization revealed that blaNDM-1 was located in IMD989 on a transmissible 80 kb plasmid, designated as pIMD989. PCR analysis confirmed that pIMD989 belongs to the IncF plasmid family. Propagation of IMD989 and selected transconjugants carrying pIMD989 over 14 days in solid media with and without antibiotic selection showed that pIMD989 is a stable plasmid.",K Novovic and Z Vasiljevic and M Kuzmanovic and J Lozo and J Begovic and M Kojic and B Jovcic,"1931-8448

The seemingly pathogenic role, with its concomitant resistance to the fluoroquinolone antibacterial agents, is worrisome to chemical microbiologist world over. The purpose of this study therefore, was to characterize the enterovirulent Escherichia coli strains isolated from diarrheic patients attending various hospitals in Benin City. Methods. Stools specimens from three hundred diarrheic patients comprising infants, below three years old and adults above three years of age., attending these hospital were cultured using routine methods in University of Benin Teaching Hospital. Enterovirulent Escherichia coli strains isolated from the specimens were identified to species levels by biotyping using the standard Methods. They were also subjected to serotyping using Escherichia coli anti-sera and were used according to the manufacturers instructions. Antibiotic susceptibility spectrum was carried out on the isolates using agar diffusion methods of stokes. R-Plasmid DNA analysis was also carried out on the strains using alkaline lysis protocol of Takahashi and Nagano. Results. Nine enterovirulent strains were isolated from the specimens and exhibited very high minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) to the fluoroquinolones antibacterial agent and some other antibiotics and were thus screened for the presence of Transferable conjugate R-Plamid mediated resistance. The R-plasmid DNA analysis showed two bands greater than 23.1KB compared with the reference molecular weight plasmid, as revealed by agarrose gel electrophoresis on a horiszontal apparatus.

17078,maybe,quinones2014,article,"This work summarized the results obtained in an institutional Klebsiella pneumoniae surveillance program recently implemented in Cuba. Eighteen hospitals from five regions provided a total of 228 K. pneumoniae isolates (164 from admitted patients, four from hospital environmental sources, and 60 isolates from community patients). The genetic relationship was assessed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the agar dilution method, and bla(ESBL) genes were sequenced. Fifty four K. pneumoniae isolates were extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL)-producers (23.6{\%}), mostly due to the CTX-M-15 enzyme (79.6{\%}). ESBL isolates were grouped in 27 different sequence types (STs), being the most prevalent ST15 (15{\%}), ST152 (13{\%}), and both ST48 and ST147 (11{\%}, respectively). Community-acquired criteria could be demonstrated in 60 patients (26{\%}) corresponding to urological (33{\%}), wound (27{\%}), respiratory (27{\%}), and otic (13{\%}) infections. Population structure analysis showed that our isolates corresponded to a highly polyclonal population with 10 nonpreviously described STs, demonstrating the importance of local epidemiological studies. We report the first data of the population structure of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae isolates obtained in a national multicenter surveillance Cuban program. Results showed that a highly polyclonal ESBL-producer K. pneumoniae population was mainly due to CTX-M-15 carriage, whereas carbapenemases production was not present.",D Quinones and A Valverde and M Rodriguez-Banos and N Kobayashi and A Zayaz and M Abreu and R Canton and R {del Campo},1076-6294,Microb Drug Resist,"*Phylogeny,Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology,Clone Cells,Cuba/epidemiology,Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field,Epidemiological Monitoring,Gene Expression,Genetic Variation,Humans,Klebsiella Infections/drug therapy/epidemiology/*m,Klebsiella pneumoniae/classification/drug effects/,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Multilocus Sequence Typing,Plasmids,Sequence Analysis, DNA,beta-Lactam Resistance/drug effects/*genetics,beta-Lactamases/*genetics/metabolism,purification",45--51,{High clonal diversity in a non-outbreak situation of clinical ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates in the first national surveillance program in Cuba},NA,20,2014,1,"1931-8448

Although coagulase-negative staphylococci, including Staphylococcus epidermidis, are often considered a contaminant in the clinical laboratory, an increasing number of reports describe their pathogenesis, in particular in infections of prosthetic devices. This article describes the isolation of a strictly anaerobic strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis in pure culture from the site of an infected prosthetic hip. This isolate was unique in that it grew only under strictly anaerobic conditions. Initially, the isolate was thought to be a known anaerobic gram-positive coccus. However, certain key biochemical and antimicrobial tests performed as part of the standard laboratory identification procedure were not consistent with results expected for any known anaerobic gram-positive coccus; the isolate was catalase positive and metronidazole and penicillin resistant. This isolate was characterized by further biochemical analysis, antimicrobial testing, and nucleic acid sequencing.

18203,maybe,salimnia2011,article,"We report the first case of Weissella confusa bacteremia in an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant patient. After engraftment and discharge, the patient returned with fever and graft failure and was started on an empiric regimen of aztreonam and vancomycin. A blood culture grew an alpha-hemolytic, gram-positive coccus forming pairs and chains, originally thought to be a viridans Streptococcus and a skin contaminant. The isolation of the organism from multiple blood cultures, and the presence of vancomycin resistance prompted identification and additional susceptibility testing. The RapIDâ¢ Str panel, which has W. confusa in its database, provided multiple incorrect identifications. The MicroScan WalkAway 96 SI, using PC-20 or -29 panels, also did not identify this bacterium, because it is not in their database. The organism was identified as W. confusa by 16S rDNA sequencing. Antibiotic susceptibility determination by Etest revealed vancomycin resistance and daptomycin susceptibility. Therapy was changed to daptomycin, and the infection resolved. Additionally, W. confusa sepsis, with multiple positive blood cultures, developed in a patient in the burn unit at our medical center. The patient's blood cultures remained positive until vancomycin was discontinued and daptomycin therapy initiated. Infections with vancomycin-resistant, gram-positive cocci are emerging among immuno compromised hosts. Under appropriate circumstances, clinicians need to request that the laboratory perform susceptibility testing and accurate identification, by nucleic acid sequencing if necessary. Sequencing of 16S rDNA is an important tool in the accurate identification of unusual pathogens. {\textcopyright} 2010 John Wiley {\&} Sons A/S.",H Salimnia and G J Alangaden and R Bharadwaj and T M Painter and P H Chandrasekar and M R Fairfax,1398-2273,Transpl Infect Dis,",*Vancomycin Resistance,16S/genetics,Adult,Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology,BACTEC 9240,Bacteremia/*microbiology,Bacterial/analysis,DNA,DNA 16S,DNA/methods,Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections/microbiology,Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse e,Homologous/adverse effects,Humans,Identicult AE PYR,Immunocompromised Host,LAP Disk,Male,MicroScan Walk Away 96 SI,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Middle Aged,RNA,RapID Str panel,Ribosomal,Sequence Analysis,Transplantation,Vancomycin/pharmacology,Weissella,Weissella confusa,Weissella/classification/drug effects/*genetics/*i,acute lymphoblastic leukemia,adult,allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation,alpha hemolytic Streptococcus,anamnesis,antibiotic sensitivity,antibiotic therapy,article,aztreonam,bacteremia,bacterial DNA,bacterium identification,bacterium isolation,blood culture,burn patient,case report,clinical feature,daptomycin,drug substitution,drug withdrawal,etest,febrile neutropenia,gene sequence,graft failure,graft recipient,human,imipenem,immunocompromised patient,male,nonhuman,priority journal,sepsis,treatment outcome,vancomycin",294--298,{Weissella confusa: An unexpected cause of vancomycin-resistant gram-positive bacteremia in immunocompromised hosts},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l361888030 http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1399-3062.2010.00586.x http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=13982273{\&}id=doi:10.1111{\%}2fj.1399-3062.2010.00586.x{\&}atitle=,13,2011,3,"from duplicate 2 (weissella confusa: an unexpected cause of vancomycin-resistant gram-positive bacteremia in immunocompromised hosts - salimnia, h; alangaden, g j; bharadwaj, r; painter, t m; chandrasekar, p h; fairfax, m r)

18250,maybe,samia2014,article,"BACKGROUND: Carbapenemantibiotics are used as the last line of treatment for infections caused by Enterobacteriaceae multidrug-resistant. However, the emergence of bacteria resistant to this important group of drug is jeopardizing the use of carbapenems. Resistance to carbapenems is due to production of enzymes Carbapenemases. Another important cause among carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) is over production of ESBL (extended spectrum $\beta$-lactamases) or Amp C enzyme in organism with porin loss. Phenotypic detection of CRE is important for proper infection control and appropriate patient management. The present study detects CRE by simple phenotypic method. METHODS: The study was a prospective study carried out at the Laboratory of Microbiology, at the university hospital center of Blida, from January 2012 to January 2014. The susceptibility to antibiotics was carried out according to recommendations of Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute by: disk diffusion method, search of ESBL and evaluation of the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC). Resistance of Enterobacteriaceae to carbapenems was defined as any strain that shows: âdiameter of the inhibition zone to Imipenem {\textless}22 mm and/or Ertapenem {\textless}21 mm âPresence of discrete colonies in the inhibition zone of carbapenems âMIC to carbapenems {\textgreater}2$\mu$g/ml or MIC to Ertapenem {\textgreater}0.5$\mu$g/ml All CRE isolates were tested by phenotypic method: Modified Hodge test (MHT) and EDTA test. RESULTS: During the study period, total of 1323 strains of Enterobacteriaceae were included.14 strains were resistant to carbapenem. The prevalence of CRE in our hospital is 0,01{\%}. These included 8 resistant strains of Enterobacterspp, 4 strains of Klebsiella spp and 2 strains of Morganellamorganii. 15 strains were resistant to carbapenems by both disk-diffusion and MIC. None of the strains among the CRE isolates showed production of ESBL enzyme. 1 of the isolates (CRE) was MLB producer (EDTA+), 5 of these isolates showed positive result in MHT. CONCLUSIONS: The emergence and the dissemination of CRE is an important threat to public health. CRE and, in particular, those with carbapenemases, are an emerging infection problem at the Blida university hospital center.

NDM-7-producing CRKP were isolated from urine, rectal swabs or blood samples from seven patients admitted to three different hospitals (Hospital Universitario La Paz, Hospital de Cantoblanco and Hospital Central de la Cruz Roja). The isolates were resistant to all antimicrobials tested except colistin and fosfomycin. One blood isolate was susceptible to minocycline and tigecycline but was resistant to fosfomycin. All isolates were closely related by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and DiversiLab{\textregistered} analysis and belonged to multilocus sequence typing (MLST) sequence type 437. In addition, blaNDM-7, blaTEM-1, blaCTX-M-15 and aac(3)-IIa were identified. Family contacts of the index case were negative for NDM-producing bacteria. The outbreak occurred in two separate waves and the cases associated with Hospital de Cantoblanco had been admitted to the same room. Environmental samples from the trap of a sink and a shower in this room were positive for NDM-7-producing CRKP. To our knowledge, this is the first reported worldwide outbreak of NDM-7-producing CRKP. No relationship with the Indian continent, the Balkans or the Middle East could be established. Frequent transfer of aged or chronically ill patients between the facilities involved may have favoured the spread of NDM-7-producing CRKP.

Methods: Species identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing were performed using VITEK 2. MBL production was confirmed by E-test. The presence of blaNDM1 was detected by PCR and confirmed by direct sequencing of the amplicon. Plasmid analysis was conducted using the alkaline lysis method. Conjugative transfer of $\beta$-lactam resistance genes was carried out using an azide-resistant derivative of E. coli J53 as recipient. Molecular fingerprints of the isolates were obtained by ERIC PCR and PFGE analysis. Results: A 72-year old patient had transurethral prostate resection in India one month prior being admitted to Tawam Hospital for treatment of pulmonary oedema and sepsis. His sputum sample yielded an NDM-1 producer K. pneumoniae on admission (KP52). The 26-year old second patient was admitted for the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia 9 days after the first patient. He did not carry any multidrug resistant bacterium on admission; neither did he travel outside of the UAE. He was treated at the hospital's ICU in a room adjacent to the first patient's for 7 days. By the 9th day of his hospital stay, while being neutropenic, he developed pneumonia caused by an NDM-1 producer K. pneumoniae (KP53). His condition progressed to multi organ failure and he died on the 18th day of hospitalization. Both isolates were resistant to all antibiotics tested except tetracycline and colistin. A 379 bp long segment of blaNDM1 (identical to GenBank FN396876.1 sequence) was detected in both isolates located on a 50kb conjugative plasmid conferring resistance to $\beta$-lactam antibiotics, only. The identical molecular fingerprint of the two isolates suggests a direct link between the two cases and strains. Conclusion: This is the first description of blaNDM1 harbouring bacterium in the United Arab Emirates. The study also demonstrates the possibility of nosocomial spread of a NDM-1 producer K. pneumoniae.

21148,maybe,tsakris2007a,article,"Objectives: A carbapenem-resistant Morganella morganii clinical isolate that was phenotypically metallo-$\beta$-lactamase (MBL)-positive was recovered from a Greek patient. The aim of the study was to analyse the structure of the integron containing the MBL gene. Methods: MICs were determined by the broth microdilution method. PCR assays and nucleotide sequencing were used for identification of bla gene types and mapping of the integron carrying the MBL gene. The location of the MBL allele was investigated by mating experiments and plasmid analysis as well as by Southern blotting of the plasmid extract and gene-specific hybridization with a blaVIM-1 probe. Results: The strain contained In 3Mor, a novel class 1 integron carrying a carbapenemase gene (blaVIM-1) associated with a trimethoprim (dfrA1), a streptothricin (sat1) and two aminoglycoside resistance genes (aacA7 and aadA1). Conjugation experiments failed to detect a transferable MBL determinant and plasmid DNA was not visualized. The chromosomal location of blaVIM-1 was confirmed after hybridization of the chromosomal band with the blaVIM-1 probe. Conclusions: Production of a VIM-type MBL ina M. morganii clinical isolate is documented in this study for the first time. Also, the dfrA1-sat1-aadA1 array which is typically described in the variable region of class 2 integrons consistent with that on Tn7 transposons, is originally detected herein in a class 1 integron. {\textcopyright} The Author 2007.

23217,maybe,yuan2012,article,"In this study, a total of 77 multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant (MDR and XDR, respectively) isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis were characterized among samples from patients living in Jiangxi province, China. The following two approaches were used: (i) genotyping all drug-resistant isolates by the 15-locus MIRU-VNTR (mycobacterial interspersed repetitive-unit-variable-number tandem-repeat) method and identifying the Beijing family genotype using the RD105 deletion targeted multiplex PCR and (ii) determining the mutation profiles associated with the resistance to the first-line antituberculous drugs rifampin (RIF) and isoniazid (INH) and the second-line drugs ofloxacin (OFX), kanamycin (KAN), amikacin (AMK), and capreomycin (CAP) with DNA sequencing. Six loci were examined: rpoB (for resistance to RIF), katG and mabA-inhA (INH), gyrA and gyrB (OFX), and rrs (KAN, AMK, and CAP). It is shown that the Beijing genotype was predominant (80.5{\%}) among these strains and that the selected drug-resistant strains were genetically diverse, suggesting that they probably had independently acquired drug resistance. In comparison to the phenotypic data, the sensitivities for the detection of RIF, INH, OFX, and KAN/AMK/CAP resistance by DNA sequencing were 94.8, 80.5, 84.6, and 78.9{\%}, respectively. The most prevalent mutations involved in RIF, INH, OFX, and KAN/AMK/CAP resistance were Ser531Leu in rpoB (44.2{\%}), Ser315Thr in katG (55.8{\%}) and C-15T in mabA-inhA (11.7{\%}), Asp94Gly in gyrA (48.7{\%}), and A1401G in rrs (73.7{\%}), respectively. Five novel katG mutants (Trp191Stop, Thr271Pro, Trp328Phe, Leu546Pro, and Asp695Gly) and six new alleles (Ile569Val, Ile572Met, Phe584Ser, Val615Met, Asp626Glu, and Lys972Thr) in the rpoB gene were identified.",X Yuan and T Zhang and K Kawakami and J Zhu and H Li and J Lei and S Tu,0095-1137,J Clin Microbiol,"*Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial,Adolescent,Adult,Aged,Antitubercular Agents/pharmacology,China,Female,Genetic Variation,Humans,Male,Microbial Sensitivity Tests/methods,Middle Aged,Molecular Sequence Data,Molecular Typing/methods,Mutation, Missense,Mycobacterium tuberculosis/*classification/*geneti,Sequence Analysis, DNA,Tuberculosis, Multidrug-Resistant/*microbiology,Young Adult",2404--2413,"{Molecular characterization of multidrug- and extensively drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains in Jiangxi, China}",NA,50,2012,7,"1098-660x

23549,yes,zhou2012a,article,"New Delhi metallo-$\beta$-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) is a novel type of metallo-$\beta$-lactamase (MBL) responsible for bacterial resistance to $\beta$-lactam antibiotics. Acinetobacter junii was previously shown to possess a MBL phenotype; however, the genes responsible for this phenotype were not identified. In this study, we reported the identification of NDM-1 gene in a clinical isolate of A. junii from a child patient in China, which was resistant to all $\beta$-lactams except aztreonam but sensitive to aminoglycosides and quinolones. The cloned NDM-1 gene contained an open reading frame of 813 bp and had a nucleotide sequence 99.9{\%} identical (812/813) to reported NDM-1 genes carried by Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Recombinant NDM-1 protein was successfully expressed in E. coli BL21, and antibiotic sensitivities of the NDM-1-producing E. coli were largely similar to the A. junii 1454 isolate. The findings of this study raise attention to the emergence and spread of NDM-1-carrying bacteria in China.",Z Zhou and R Guan and Y Yang and L Chen and J Fu and Q Deng and Y Xie and Y Huang and J Wang and D Wang and C Liao and S Gong and H Xia,0008-4166,Canadian Journal of Microbiology,",Acinetobacter Infections/microbiology,Acinetobacter baumannii,Acinetobacter infection,Acinetobacter junii,Acinetobacter/drug effects/*enzymology/isolation {\&},Adolescent,Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology,China,Enterococcus faecium,Escherichia coli,Escherichia coli/drug effects/genetics,Humans,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Male,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Recombinant Proteins/genetics,adolescent,amikacin,ampicillin,antibiotic resistance,antibiotic sensitivity,aztreonam,bacterium isolate,beta-Lactamases/chemistry/*genetics,beta-Lactams/pharmacology,case report,cefazolin,cefepime,cefoperazone,cefotetan,ceftazidime,ceftriaxone,ciprofloxacin,cotrimoxazole,ertapenem,gentamicin,human,imipenem,levofloxacin,linezolid,male,metallo beta lactamase,minimum inhibitory concentration,nitrofurantoin,nonhuman,note,open reading frame,phenotype,priority journal,sulbactam,tobramycin",112--115,{Identification of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase gene (NDM-1) from a clinical isolate of Acinetobacter junii in China},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l364062016 http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/w11-112 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=00084166{\&}id=doi:10.1139{\%}2fw11-112{\&}atitle=identification+of+new+delhi+metall,58,2012,1,"from duplicate 2 (identification of new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase gene (ndm-1) from a clinical isolate of acinetobacter junii in china - zhou, z; guan, r; yang, y; chen, l; fu, j; deng, q; xie, y; huang, y; wang, j; wang, d; liao, c; gong, s; xia, h)

23564,maybe,zhu2008a,article,"Five of the seven cases of vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA) infection identified to date have occurred in southeastern Michigan. VRSA isolates from the four most recent cases (all from Michigan) were characterized. The vanA gene was localized to a single plasmid in each VRSA isolate. The pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns of chromosomal DNA and the restriction profile of the plasmid demonstrated that the four isolates were unique and differed from the first three VRSA isolates. Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) isolates, all of which were Enterococcus faecalis, were recovered from case patients 4 to 6. Each VRE isolate transferred vancomycin resistance to E. faecalis JH2-2 by conjugation. PCRs for vanA and the Inc18-like plasmid genes traA and repR confirmed the presence of an Inc18-like vanA plasmid in all VRE isolates and transconjugants. An Inc18-like vanA plasmid was identified in the VRSA isolate from case patient 7. These findings suggest a role of Inc18-like plasmids as vanA donors.",W Zhu and N C Clark and L K McDougal and J Hageman and L C McDonald and J B Patel,"0066-4804 (print)
