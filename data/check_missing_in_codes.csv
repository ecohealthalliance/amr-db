Human infections are seen mostly in immunocompromized hosts. The usual primary site of lesions is lung. Nocardia can enter the peritoneal cavity through the Tenckhoff catheter. We describe the first case of nocardia peritonitis that had associated nocardia pneumonia. The Tenckhoff catheter was removed due to nonresolution of peritonitis.

38,yes,abdelhadi2012,article,"Culture and resistance testing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis are not regularly performed in Chad. Sputa were obtained from three different categories of hospitals (district, regional and national) in Chad. All examined sputa were smear-positive and were investigated by culture and drug resistance testing for first-line antituberculosis drugs. From 232 sputa positive for acid-fast bacilli, 135 isolates of M. tuberculosis from different patients (46 women, 89 men, mean age 34 years) were analyzed. All the patients except one corresponded to new cases of tuberculosis. In total, 27 out of 135 isolates (20{\%}) were resistant to at least one major antituberculosis drug. Resistance to isoniazid was the most frequent resistance observed, with 18 isolates (13{\%}) presenting at least this resistance. Three isolates (2.2{\%}) were resistant to isoniazid and rifampicin (multidrug resistance MDR) including one isolate being concomitantly resistant to streptomycin and ethambutol. The resistance rate differed in relation to the category of the hospital; the most important resistance rate was observed in regional hospitals (33{\%}), while it was 16{\%} and 14{\%} in the national and district hospitals, respectively. HIV serology was performed in 81 patients, among whom 20 (25{\%}) were positive. This is the first study that shows that drug resistance of M. tuberculosis is present in Chad. Besides single drug-resistant isolates, multidrug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis could also be identified.

7761,yes,grisold2011,article,"Objectives: Extended-spectrum $\beta$-lactamase-producing (ESBL) Enterobacteriaceae have emerged as major public health problem throughout the world, in particular India and Pakistan. We report the emergence of the newly described resistance mechanism conferred by New Delhi metallo-$\beta$-lactamase 1 (NDM-1) in Austria. NDM-1 positive Enterobacteriaceae (2x Klebsiella pneumoniae and 1x E. coli) has been detected in three patients at the University Hospital of Graz, Austria, with all three cases occurring within the last 6 months. Methods: NDM-1 shares very little identity with other metallob- lactamase (MBL) enzymes and Enterobacteriaceae with NDM-1 show high resistance to nearly all commonly used antibiotics. Primers for PCR detection of NDM-1 were designed based on GenBank (National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) database entry AB571289.1 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/300422615). Results: NDM-1 was detected in isolates of three patients, in two cases in K. pneumoniae, and one patient with NDM-1 positive E. coli. All threecases occurred between December 2009 and August 2010. Patient one (NDM-1 K. pneumoniae), a 30-year-old Austrian male was admitted to our University Hospital in November 2009. History revealed that he had suffered multiple open fractures of his upper and lower left leg and rectal laceration due to a motorcycle accident in Pakistan. In patient two the NDM-1 K. pneumoniae was detected in August 2010, the patient being a 14-year-old Kosovarian boy transferred from Kosovo to the Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Graz, with multiple intraabdominal abscess formations and peritonitis. He had undergone appendectomy in Pristina, Kosovo, in April 2010 and had developed abdominal sepsis consecutively. Patient number three (NDM-1 E. coli), a 56 year old male developed a necrotizing fasciitis when being in India in January 2010, after a short admittance at a hospital in New Delhi the patient was transferred to Austria. Conclusion: Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae with the newly described resistance enzyme NDM-1 have been recently shown to pose the potential of growing to a major public health problem worldwide. We report the emergence of NDM-1 among Enterobacteriaceae in Austria. During December 2009 and August 2010 two patients with K. pneumoniae carrying NDM-1 and one patient with NDM-1 E. coli were identified at the Medical University of Graz, Austria.",A J Grisold and G Zarfel and M Hí_nigl and T Valentin and H J Salzer and E Leitner and R Krause,1198-743x,Clinical Microbiology and Infection,"Austria,Enterobacteriaceae,Escherichia coli,GenBank,India,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Pakistan,abdominal abscess,antibiotic agent,appendectomy,biotechnology,boy,data base,enzyme,hospital,hospital patient,human,identity,laceration,leg,male,national health organization,necrotizing fasciitis,open fracture,patient,pediatrics,penicillinase,peritonitis,public health problem,sepsis,traffic accident,university,university hospital",s137--s138,{Emergence of New Delhi metallo-$\beta$-lactamase (NDM-1)- Producing Enterobacteriaceae in Austria},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l70599317 http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-0691.2011.03558.x http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=1198743x{\&}id=doi:10.1111{\%}2fj.1469-0691.2011.03558.x{\&}atitle=e,17,2011,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,yes,brooke,yes,nchedo,nchedo,mushtaq,yes,md_6.csv,NA,NA,NA,check_mex_files

4717,yes,david2008,article,"AIM OF THE STUDY: This retrospective study was conducted in order to characterize mechanisms of resistance to beta-lactams and clonality of 24 isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These strains were isolated from patients hospitalized in Rouen University Hospital between August 2004 and December 2006 and were resistant to cefepime and/or ceftazidime (PMR) by a mechanism not only related to overproduction of the cephalosporinase. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical strains of PMR were characterized by conventional biochemical methods, antibiotic susceptibility testing by disk diffusion in agar with or without cloxacillin and RAPD for genetic comparison. Identification of beta-lactamase was performed by PCR amplification followed by sequencing of bla genes. RESULTS: All strains produced the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) TEM-116. Epidemiological study identified eight unrelated strains, eight related strains originating from a single unit, three related strains isolated in different wards and five related strains coproducing TEM-116 and SHV-2a but isolated in different units. Detection of ESBL in these strains was difficult due to a low level of ESBL production. CONCLUSION: This is the first report of TEM-116 in France in 24 strains of P. aeruginosa and its association with SHV-2a in five cases. SHV-2a has been described in P. aeruginosa in France but not TEM-116 which was recently reported in this species, in China and in Netherlands (in a strain coproducing SHV-12).

15560,yes,onken2015a,article,"Background Bloodstream infections (BSI) are frequent and cause high case-fatality rates. Urgent antibiotic treatment can save patients' lives, but antibiotic resistance can render antibiotic therapy futile. This study is the first to collect epidemiological data on BSI from Unguja, Zanzibar. Methods Clinical data and blood for culturing and susceptibility testing of isolated microbes were obtained from 469 consecutively enrolled neonates, children and adults presenting with signs of systemic infections at Mnazi Mmoja Hospital (MMH), Zanzibar. Results Pathogenic bacteria were recovered fromthe blood of 14{\%}of the patients (66/469). The most frequently isolated microbes were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter spp. and Staphylococcus aureus. Infections were community-acquired in 56 patients (85{\%}) and hospital-acquired in 8 (12{\%}) (datamissing for 2 patients). BSI caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae (E. coli, K. pneumoniae) was found in 5 cases, of which 3 were community-acquired and 2 hospital-acquired. Three of these patients died. Six of 7 Salmonella Typhi isolates were multidrug resistant. Streptococcus pneumoniae was found in one patient only. Conclusions This is the first report of ESBL-producing bacteria causing BSI from the Zanzibar archipelago. Our finding of community-acquired BSI caused by ESBL-producing bacteria is alarming, as it implies that these difficult-to-treat bacteria have already spread in the society. In the local setting these infections are virtually impossible to cure. The findings call for increased awareness of rational antibiotic use, infection control and surveillance to counteract the problem of emerging antimicrobial resistance.",A Onken and A K Said and M Jorstad and P A Jenum and B Blomberg and M JÌürstad and P A Jenum and B Blomberg,1932-6203,PLoS ONE,",*Drug Resistance,Acinetobacter,Adolescent,Adult,Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology,Bacteremia/drug therapy/*epidemiology/microbiology,Child,Community-Acquired Infections/drug therapy/*epidem,Cross Infection/drug therapy/*epidemiology/microbi,Escherichia coli,Female,Humans,Infant,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Male,Microbial,Newborn,Preschool,Prevalence,Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi,Staphylococcus aureus,Streptococcus pneumoniae,Tanzania,Tanzania/epidemiology,adolescent,adult,ampicillin,antibiotic resistance,antibiotic sensitivity,article,blood culture,bloodstream infection,cefotaxime,ceftazidime,child,chloramphenicol,ciprofloxacin,community acquired infection,cotrimoxazole,epidemiological data,extended spectrum beta lactamase producing Enterob,female,gentamicin,hospital infection,human,infant,major clinical study,male,meropenem,mortality,multidrug resistance,newborn,nonhuman,oxacillin,penicillin G,piperacillin plus tazobactam,preschool child,prevalence",e0145632,"{Prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of microbes causing bloodstream infections in unguja, Zanzibar}",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l608043455 http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0145632 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=19326203{\&}id=doi:10.1371{\%}2fjournal.pone.0145632{\&}atitle=prevalen,10,2015,12,"from duplicate 2 (prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of microbes causing bloodstream infections in unguja, zanzibar - onken, a; said, a k; jorstad, m; jenum, p a; blomberg, b)1932-6203onken, annettesaid, abdulrahman kjorstad, melissajenum, pal ablomberg, bjornjournal articleresearch support, non-u.s. gov'tunited statesplos one. 2015 dec 23;10(12):e0145632. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0145632. ecollection 2015.",10.1371/journal.pone.0145632,12/25/15,eng,26700032,maybe,brooke,no,erica,allison,zach_4,yes,zm_4.csv,NA,NA,NA,check_mex_files
