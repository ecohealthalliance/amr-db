"2","38","yes","abdelhadi2012","article","Culture and resistance testing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis are not regularly performed in Chad. Sputa were obtained from three different categories of hospitals (district, regional and national) in Chad. All examined sputa were smear-positive and were investigated by culture and drug resistance testing for first-line antituberculosis drugs. From 232 sputa positive for acid-fast bacilli, 135 isolates of M. tuberculosis from different patients (46 women, 89 men, mean age 34 years) were analyzed. All the patients except one corresponded to new cases of tuberculosis. In total, 27 out of 135 isolates (20{\%}) were resistant to at least one major antituberculosis drug. Resistance to isoniazid was the most frequent resistance observed, with 18 isolates (13{\%}) presenting at least this resistance. Three isolates (2.2{\%}) were resistant to isoniazid and rifampicin (multidrug resistance MDR) including one isolate being concomitantly resistant to streptomycin and ethambutol. The resistance rate differed in relation to the category of the hospital; the most important resistance rate was observed in regional hospitals (33{\%}), while it was 16{\%} and 14{\%} in the national and district hospitals, respectively. HIV serology was performed in 81 patients, among whom 20 (25{\%}) were positive. This is the first study that shows that drug resistance of M. tuberculosis is present in Chad. Besides single drug-resistant isolates, multidrug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis could also be identified. This result highlights the urgency of initiating actions to detect drug resistance and limit the spread of drug-resistant strains.","O Abdelhadi and J Ndokain and M M Ali and V Friocourt and E Mortier and B Heym","0037-9085 (print)

Among them, 34 (30.6{\%}) strains, isolated within 2 hospitals (A and B), exhibited nonsusceptibility to cefotaxime with significant reduction of MIC ({\textgreater} or = 3 log2 dilution) by the effect of clavulanic acid, which confirmed the phenotype of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). These ESBL producers were coresistant to gentamicin, isepamicin, and amikacin, but remained susceptible to ceftazidime (MIC, {\textless} or = 0.5 microg/mL) and meropenem (MIC, {\textless}0.5 microg/mL). By isoelectric focusing analysis, polymerase chain reaction, and nucleotide sequencing, we detected the presence of CTX-M-14 in 33 strains and CTX-M-3 in 6 strains (5 strains harboring both CTX-M-14 and CTX-M-3 enzymes). These beta-lactamase genes can be successfully transferred by the conjugative plasmid. Molecular epidemiology of the 34 ESBL-producing P. mirabilis strains by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis using SfiI restriction enzyme revealed 9 different genotypes, suggesting epidemic clones with intra- and interhospital spread. In conclusion, the broadly extended clonal spreading of CTX-M-type P. mirabilis was first discovered at the district hospitals in Taiwan.","L T Wu and H J Wu and J G Chung and Y C Chuang and K C Cheng and W L Yu","0732-8893 (print)0732-8893","Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis","Bacterial Proteins/analysis/genetics,Biomarkers,Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field,Genome, Bacterial,Genotype,Hospitals, District,Humans,Lactams/pharmacology,Molecular Epidemiology,Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length,Proteus Infections/*epidemiology/*microbiology,Proteus mirabilis/drug effects/*enzymology/isolati,Respiratory Tract Infections/epidemiology/microbio,Taiwan,Urinary Tract Infections/epidemiology/microbiology,beta-Lactam Resistance/*genetics,beta-Lactamases/analysis/*genetics","89--94","{Dissemination of Proteus mirabilis isolates harboring CTX-M-14 and CTX-M-3 beta-lactamases at 2 hospitals in Taiwan}",NA,"54","2006","2","wu, lii-tzuwu, hwa-jenchung, jing-gungchuang, yin-chingcheng, kuo-chenyu, wen-liangjournal articleresearch support, non-u.s. gov'tunited statesdiagn microbiol infect dis. 2006 feb;54(2):89-94. epub 2006 jan 9.","10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2005.09.005","1/13/06","eng","16406185","maybe","erica","no","mushtaq","allison","mushtaq","yes",NA,NA

We analysed auxotrophy of cultured SCVs, their antimicrobial susceptibility profiles and their biofilm-forming capacity. Eight SCV strains were cultivated from six (19 {\%}) patients. All SCVs were coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) with Staphylococcus epidermidis as the predominant species; there was also one Staphylococcus warneri SCV. The SCVs were auxotrophic for haemin, with one strain additionally auxotrophic for menadione. We noted the presence of two phenotypically (differences concerning antimicrobial susceptibility) and genetically distinct SCV strains in one patient, as well as the growth of two genetically related SCVs that differed in terms of their morphology and the type of auxotrophy in another. Seven out of eight SCVs were resistant to meticillin and gentamicin. In addition, antibiotic sensitivity testing revealed three multidrug-resistant SCV-normal-morphology isolate pairs. One S. epidermidis SCV harboured icaADBC genes and was found to be a proficient biofilm producer. This paper highlights the involvement of CNS SCVs in the aetiology of PJIs, including what is believed to be the first report of a S. warneri SCV. These subpopulations must be actively sought in the routine diagnosis of implant-associated infections. Moreover, in view of the phenotypic and genetic diversity of some SCV pairs, particular attention should be paid to the investigation of all types of observed colony morphologies, and isolates should be subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing.","A Bogut and J NiedÅºwiadek and M KozioÅ-Montewka and D Strzelec-Nowak and J Blacha and T Mazurkiewicz and W MarczyÅski and D Plewik and J Niedzwiadek and M Koziol-Montewka and D Strzelec-Nowak and J Blacha and T Mazurkiewicz and W Marczynski and D Plewik","0022-2615","Journal of Medical Microbiology",",Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology,Arthritis/*microbiology,Biofilms/growth {\&} development,Cluster Analysis,Coagulase/secretion,Hemin/metabolism,Humans,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Molecular Typing,Prosthesis-Related Infections/*microbiology,Staphylococcal Infections/*microbiology,Staphylococcus epidermidis,Staphylococcus warneri,Staphylococcus/drug effects/growth {\&} development/i,Virulence Factors/genetics,antibiotic sensitivity,article,auxotrophy,bacterium isolate,biofilm,clinical article,controlled study,genetic variability,human,nonhuman,phenotype,priority journal,prosthesis infection,prosthesis loosening,prosthetic joint infection,purification/*physiology,small colony variant,total hip prosthesis","176--185","{Characterization of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphyloccocus warneri small-colony variants associated with prosthetic-joint infections}","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l372198771 http://dx.doi.org/10.1099/jmm.0.066068-0 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=00222615{\&}id=doi:10.1099{\%}2fjmm.0.066068-0{\&}atitle=characterization+of+","63","2014","pt 2","from duplicate 1 (characterization of staphylococcus epidermidis and staphyloccocus warneri small-colony variants associated with prosthetic-joint infections - bogut, a; niedzwiadek, j; koziol-montewka, m; strzelec-nowak, d; blacha, j; mazurkiewicz, t; marczynski, w; plewik, d)1473-5644bogut, agnieszkaniedzwiadek, justynakoziol-montewka, mariastrzelec-nowak, dagmarablacha, janmazurkiewicz, tomaszmarczynski, wojciechplewik, dorotajournal articleenglandj med microbiol. 2014 feb;63(pt 2):176-85. doi: 10.1099/jmm.0.066068-0. epub 2013 nov 20.","10.1099/jmm.0.066068-0","11/22/13","eng","24257683","yes","allison","no","mushtaq","brooke","mushtaq","yes",NA,NA

"11","15253","yes","nouvenne2013","article","Objectives: Carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC) is an emerging multidrug resistant nosocomial pathogen. It may cause epidemic outbreaks of serious systemic infections in hospital in-patients with a high degree of frailty and a large number of comorbidities. Its intrinsic resistance to almost every antibiotic therapy makes these infections particularly difficult to treat, with a documented mortality rate next to 60{\%}. The first epidemic outbreak in Italy was described in 2009,while our hospitalwas involved for the first time in July 2011. The aims of this research were therefore to describe the characteristics of a KPC outbreak in a subacute critical care ward and to assess the effect of sanitary measures (bed isolation vs cohort isolation). Materials and methods: At InternalMedicine and Critical Subacute Care Unit of Parma University Hospital we consecutively studied all patients infected by KPC (133 patients, M 75, F 58, mean age 79Â± 12 years) from August 2011 toMay 2012.Werecordedmain diagnosis, comorbidities, length of hospital stay, outcome, and anatomical district of KPC isolation for all patients. Following Emilia-Romagna Regional Guidelines, all infected patients, all contacts of these patients and all bedridden patients of the same ward were subdued to a rectal tampon for KPC detection every 7 days. FromOctober 2011 to February 2012 we also activated a 14-bed isolation ward applying a staff cohorting management. In the previous and following periodwe instead applied the traditional contact isolation approach. Results: During the first two months of epidemic outbreak with the traditional contact isolation approach we observed 41 new cases (23 in the first month and 18 in the second month). The cases were limited to an average of 8 cases per month (range 3-13) in the following 5 months after the activation of the 14-bed staff cohorting ward. After the restoration of the usual contact isolation measures, we observed a newincrease in incidence rates (respectively 15 and 18 cases in April and May 2012). Mean length of hospital stay of KPC-positive patients was significantly longer than that of other patients admitted to our unit (35 Â± 24 vs 18 Â± 12 days, p {\textless} 0.001). Inmost cases, KPC was isolated in rectal tampon cultures. 29 patients out of 133 (14{\%}) deceased during hospital stay. Most of the deaths were attributable to septic shock and occurred in the first two months of the epidemic outbreak. The most prevalent comorbidities were cardiopathies (84/133 patients, 64{\%}) and COPD (72/133 patients, 54{\%}). Conclusions: KPC infection is quickly emerging as a relevant health issue, especially in elderly frail inpatients with multiple comorbidities. Mortality in our setting has however been lower than that described in the literature. Staff cohorting isolation measures may be effective to limit the epidemic spread, although a periodicity in KPC infections, like the one observed for other Enterobacteriaceae, cannot be excluded.","A Nouvenne and A Ticinesi and N Cerundolo and I Morelli and L Guida and B Prati and G Ragni and E Ridolo and L Borghi and T Meschi","0953-6205","European Journal of Internal Medicine","Enterobacteriaceae,Italy,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Klebsiella pneumoniae infection,aged,antibiotic therapy,carbapenemase,death,diagnosis,epidemic,health,hospital,hospital patient,hospitalization,human,incidence,infection,intensive care,internal medicine,mortality,pathogenesis,patient,periodicity,septic shock,tampon,university hospital,ward","e197","{Carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC) infection outbreak in Italy: Report of an experience with elderly frail patients}","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l71226129 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejim.2013.08.504 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=09536205{\&}id=doi:10.1016{\%}2fj.ejim.2013.08.504{\&}atitle=carbapenemase","24","2013",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"maybe","melanie","no","mushtaq","zach","mushtaq","yes",NA,NA
"12","22993","yes","yang2016g","article","Multidrug-resistant gram-negative rods are reported worldwide. Carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae have been reported to an increasing extent, largely as a consequence of the acquisition of carbapenemase genes. The treatment of infections caused by Enterobacter cloacae and other enterobacteriaceae has become a troublesome clinical problem in the case of limited therapeutic options. Resistance to Carbapenem caused by Enterobacter cloacae and other enterobacteriaceae is relatively rare; therefore, this class of drugs is the last line of defense against multidrug-resistant Enterobacter cloacae for the treatment of severe infections. Unfortunately, increasing production of New Delhi metallo-$\beta$-lactamase 1 (NDM-1) has become established as a major public health threat and represents a new challenge in the treatment of infectious diseases. In this study, we describe the ability of Enterobacter cloacae to produce carbapenemase enzymes based on the results of Modified Hodge test and the biochemical Carba NP test performed according to guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). Furthermore, we assessed the presence of genes in charge of the production of carbapenemases (blaKPC, blaVIM, blaIMP, blaOXA-48, blaNDM) among Enterobacter cloacae. The tested isolate of Enterobacter cloacae that occupied the blaNDM-1 and blaVIM-19 genes were determined. To our knowledge, this is the first detection of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacter cloacae (n=4) consisted of sequence type 508 (ST508) with NDM-1 and VIM-19, ST509 with NDM-1, and ST145 with VIM-19 in china. Our results show that on the classification ability of carbapenemase producing Enterobacter cloacae, PFGE and MLST have no much difference in two ST509. Clinical microbiology laboratories should remain vigilant in detecting Enterobacter cloacae with carbapenemases.","Y Yang and C Li","1940-5901","International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Medicine","China,Enterobacter cloacae,carbapenem,carbapenemase,case report,classification,communicable disease,endogenous compound,gene expression,human,metallo beta lactamase,microbiology,nonhuman,practice guideline,public health","22227--22231","{First report of synergistically containing blaNDM-1 and blaVIM-19 carbapenemase producing enterobacter cloacae ST508 in the center of China}","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l613473640 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=19405901{\&}id=doi:{\&}atitle=first+report+of+synergistically+containing+blandm-1+and+blavim-19+carbapenemase+produ","9","2016","11",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"yes","brooke","no","mushtaq","ayomide","mushtaq","yes",NA,NA

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective survey was made over a period of twelve months (year 2009). It focused on 3564 patients with urinary tract infection confirmed by the Laboratory of Microbiology in the University Hospital, Mahdia. RESULTS: Klebsiella spp. was involved in 5.5{\%} (198/3564) of all cases of urinary tract infections identified. Klebsiella pneumoniae accounted for 94.9{\%} of all Klebsiella (5.1{\%} for Klebsiella oxytoca). The frequency of Klebsiella spp. resistance to fluoroquinolones was 19.2{\%} and to third generation cephalosporins was 22.7{\%}. Forty strains of Klebsiella spp. producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase witch corresponds to 20.2{\%} of all the Klebsiella. The extended-spectrum beta-lactamase strains with resistance to fluoroquinolones were 67.5{\%} (27/40) or 13.6{\%} of all klebsiella (27/198). No strain was resistant to imipenem. The 27 strains multiresistant (ESBL+FQ resistance) are likely to be carriers of plasmids encoding the ESBL and resistance to fluoroquinolones. CONCLUSION: the resistance of Enterobacteriaceae, including Klebsiella spp, to fluoroquinolones has become a concern both in hospital in community medicine. The advent of this resistance mechanism involves a more rational use of fluoroquinolones, especially as first-line treatment of urinary tract infections.","A {Ben Haj Khalifa} and M Khedher","0369-8114","Pathol Biol (Paris)","Cross Infection/epidemiology/microbiology,Female,Hospital Units/statistics {\&} numerical data,Hospitals, University,Humans,Klebsiella Infections/*epidemiology/microbiology,Klebsiella oxytoca/isolation {\&} purification/physio,Klebsiella pneumoniae/isolation {\&} purification/phy,Klebsiella/classification/isolation {\&} purification,Male,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Retrospective Studies,Tunisia/epidemiology,Urinary Tract Infections/*epidemiology/microbiolog,beta-Lactamases/*metabolism","e1--5","{[Epidemiological study of Klebsiella spp. uropathogenic strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase in a Tunisian university hospital, 2009]}",NA,"60","2012","2","1768-3114ben haj khalifa, akhedher, menglish abstractjournal articlefrancepathol biol (paris). 2012 apr;60(2):e1-5. doi: 10.1016/j.patbio.2010.11.003. epub 2010 dec 8.","10.1016/j.patbio.2010.11.003","12/15/10","fre","21145175","yes","allison","maybe","brooke","brooke","mushtaq","yes",NA,NA

In this context, we have applied Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) based whole genome analysis on three ocular isolates of MDR P. aeruginosa to explore the drug resistance determinants and genomic level variations. Methods: Three ocular isolates namely P. aeruginosa VRFP03, VRFPA04 from two different Keratitis patients (corneal button) and VRFPA05 isolated from the intraocular specimen (Vitreous humor) collected from an endophthalmitis patient was included in this study. Phenotypically VRFPA03, VRFPA04, VRFPA05 showed resistant to a wide group of antibiotics and hence they were taken up for Ion Torrent-PGM based whole genome study. Results: Here, we report the first complete genome sequence of MDR P. aeruginosa VRFPA04 isolated from the Indian keratitis patients clinical specimen (corneal button) submitted to L {\&} T Microbiology Research Centre, Vision Research Foundation, Sankara Nethralaya, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.

Annotation of the contigs was performed using the RAST Server, followed by manual inspection and correction. Results: These similar plasmids were obtained from two patients with overlapping stays at the same hospital. The pLK75 and pLK78 plasmids were 56,489-bp and 56,072-bp in length, respectively. Plasmid annotation revealed a common backbone similar to the IncN plasmid pR46. The regions flanking the blaNDM-1 genes in these plasmids were very similar to plasmid pNDM-HU01 in Japan, which contains a complex class 1 integron located next to an ISCR1 element.

One patient lived in a nursing home and was never hospitalised, whereas the other patient was repeatedly hospitalised in this hospital. The aim of this study was to unveil the molecular mechanisms associated with the carbapenem resistance of these isolates and to assess its potential dissemination. Methods Isolate identification was performed by VITEK{\textregistered}2 and was confirmed by 16S rDNA sequencing. The clonal relationship of the isolates was evaluated by repetitive element palindromic PCR (rep-PCR). Antibiotic susceptibility was determined using the automatic VITEK{\textregistered}2 AES system and disk diffusion assay. $\beta$-Lactamases, porins and mobile genetic elements were characterised by PCR and sequencing. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and Southern blot hybridisation were used to determine the genetic location of integrons, and their transferability was tested by conjugation. Results No genetic relatedness was found, suggesting different origins of the isolates. In isolate Cf254 a VIM-2 carbapenemase integrated in In58 was detected, located in a high-frequency conjugative IncL/M plasmid that also carried CTX-M-15 and CMY-39 genes. VIM-1 in isolate Cf872 was chromosomal. This is the first description in Portugal of VIM carbapenemases in C. freundii. Loss/alteration of porins was also detected. Conclusions Emergence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteria is not confined to the nosocomial environment.

The pandemic sequence type (ST)8/pulsed-field gel type USA300 is the dominant CA-MRSA clone in the United States, but its evolutionary history and basis for biological success are incompletely understood. Here, we use whole-genome sequencing of 387 ST8 isolates drawn from an epidemiological network of CA-MRSA infections and colonizations in northern Manhattan to explore short-term evolution and transmission patterns. Phylogenetic analysis predicted that USA300 diverged from a most common recent ancestor around 1993. We found evidence for multiple introductions of USA300 and reconstructed the phylogeographic spread of isolates across neighborhoods. Using pair-wise single-nucleotide polymorphism distances as a measure of genetic relatedness between isolates, we observed that most USA300 isolates had become endemic in households, indicating their critical role as reservoirs for transmission and diversification. Using the maximum single-nucleotide polymorphism variability of isolates from within households as a threshold, we identified several possible transmission networks beyond households. Our study also revealed the evolution of a fluoroquinolone-resistant subpopulation in the mid-1990s and its subsequent expansion at a time of high-frequency outpatient antibiotic use. This high-resolution phylogenetic analysis of ST8 has documented the genomic changes associated with USA300 evolution and how some of its recent evolution has been shaped by antibiotic use. By integrating whole-genome sequencing with detailed epidemiological analyses, our study provides an important framework for delineating the full diversity and spread of USA300 and other emerging pathogens in large urban community populations.","A C Uhlemann and J Dordel and J R Knox and K E Raven and J Parkhill and M T Holden and S J Peacock and F D Lowy","0027-8424","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","Case-Control Studies,Cc8,Community-Acquired Infections/epidemiology/microbi,Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial/genetics,Evolution, Molecular,Genome, Bacterial,Humans,Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus/classi,Molecular Epidemiology,New York City/epidemiology,Phylogeny,Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide,Staphylococcal Infections/*epidemiology/*microbiol,United States/epidemiology,Urban Population,drug resistance,genomics,purification","6738--6743","{Molecular tracing of the emergence, diversification, and transmission of S. aureus sequence type 8 in a New York community}",NA,"111","2014","18","1091-6490uhlemann, anne-catrindordel, janinaknox, justin rraven, kathy eparkhill, julianholden, matthew t gpeacock, sharon jlowy, franklin dk08 ai090013/ai/niaid nih hhs/united states098051/wellcome trust/united kingdomr01 ai082536/ai/niaid nih hhs/united statesg1000803/medical research council/united kingdomr21 ai103562/ai/niaid nih hhs/united statesjournal articleresearch support, n.i.h., extramuralresearch support, non-u.s. gov'tunited statesproc natl acad sci u s a. 2014 may 6;111(18):6738-43. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1401006111. epub 2014 apr 21.","10.1073/pnas.1401006111","4/23/14","eng","24753569","maybe","erica","yes","nchedo","nchedo","mushtaq","yes",NA,NA

"24","20835","maybe","tietze2015","article","A large outbreak of gastrointestinal disease occurred in 2011 in Germany which resulted in almost 4000 patients with acute gastroenteritis or hemorrhagic colitis, 855 cases of a hemolytic uremic syndrome and 53 deaths. The pathogen was an uncommon, multiresistant Escherichia coli strain of serotype O104:H4 which expressed a Shiga toxin characteristic of enterohemorrhagic E. coli and in addition virulence factors common to enteroaggregative E. coli. During post-epidemic surveillance of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) all but two of O104:H4 isolates were indistinguishable from the epidemic strain. Here we describe two novel STEC O104:H4 strains isolated in close spatiotemporal proximity to the outbreak which show a virulence gene panel, a Shiga toxin-mediated cytotoxicity towards Vero cells and aggregative adherence to Hep-2 cells comparable to the outbreak strain. They differ however both from the epidemic strain and from each other, by their antibiotic resistance phenotypes and some other features as determined by routine epidemiological subtyping methods. Whole genome sequencing of these two strains, of ten outbreak strain isolates originating from different time points of the outbreak and of one historical sporadic EHEC O104:H4 isolate was performed. Sequence analysis revealed a clear phylogenetic distance between the two variant strains and the outbreak strain finally identifying them as epidemiologically unrelated isolates from sporadic cases. These findings add to the knowledge about this emerging pathogen, illustrating a certain diversity within the bacterial core genome as well as loss and gain of accessory elements. Our results do also support the view that distinct new variants of STEC O104:H4 repeatedly might originate from yet unknown reservoirs, rather than that there would be a continuous diversification of a single epidemic strain established and circulating in Germany after the large outbreak in 2011.","E Tietze and P W Dabrowski and R Prager and A Radonic and A Fruth and P Aurass and A Nitsche and M Mielke and A Flieger","1932-6203","PLoS ONE","*Shiga-Toxigenic Escherichia coli/classification/g,Animals,Bacterial Adhesion,Cercopithecus aethiops,DNA, Bacterial/genetics,Disease Outbreaks,Escherichia coli Infections/epidemiology/*microbio,Genome, Bacterial,Germany/epidemiology,Hep G2 Cells,Humans,Molecular Sequence Data,Phylogeny,Plasmids/genetics,Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide,Sequence Analysis, DNA,Serogroup,Vero Cells,Virulence/genetics","e0122074","{Comparative genomic analysis of two novel sporadic Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli O104:H4 strains isolated 2011 in Germany}",NA,"10","2015","4","1932-6203tietze, erharddabrowski, piotr wojciechprager, ritaradonic, aleksandarfruth, angelikaaurass, philippnitsche, andreasmielke, martinflieger, antjecomparative studyjournal articleresearch support, non-u.s. gov'tunited statesplos one. 2015 apr 2;10(4):e0122074. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0122074. ecollection 2015.","10.1371/journal.pone.0122074","4/4/15","eng","25836671","yes","melanie","maybe","zach","zach","mushtaq","yes",NA,NA

The aerosol administration allows high concentrations of tobramycin to be delivered to the site of infection with limited systemic absorption. In rare patients, systemic absorption of inhaled tobramycin may be significant enough to produce toxic effects, such as renal and vestibular toxicities. Case presentation: We report a patient with CF who developed recurrent eosinophilia and severe persistent bronchospasm following repeated administration of preservative-free tobramycin by inhalation, beginning at 16 months of age. Also, he developed similar signs and symptoms when he was administered tobramycin intravenously on one occasion at 5 1/2 years. The patient had a history of environmental allergies. Temporal sequence of his signs and symptoms after each administration of tobramycin (similar to re-challenge testing), and his improvement after discontinuation of the drug strongly suggest an adverse drug reaction. Conclusion: Hypersensitivity reaction should be considered in patients who develop recurrent eosinophilia and deterioration of pulmonary function following the use of tobramycin by inhalation or by intravenous administration. {\textcopyright} 2007 Santos et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","R P Santos and E Awa and R D Anbar","1471-2431","BMC Pediatrics","Achromobacter xylosoxidans,Pseudomonas aeruginosa,Serratia marcescens,Staphylococcus aureus,airway obstruction,amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid,anamnesis,antibiotic agent,antibiotic resistance,antibody blood level,antibody titer,article,azithromycin,bacterial infection,bronchodilating agent,bronchospasm,budesonide,case report,ceftazidime,child,ciprofloxacin,computer assisted tomography,coughing,cromoglycate disodium,cystic fibrosis,differential diagnosis,dornase alfa,drug dose increase,drug treatment failure,drug withdrawal,enzyme replacement,eosinophil count,eosinophilia,familial disease,forced expiratory volume,human,immunoglobulin E,laboratory test,lung aspergillosis,lung function test,lung infiltrate,male,montelukast,multivitamin,nasal biopsy,nebulization,nonhuman,pancreas enzyme,pancreas insufficiency,pathogenesis,prednisolone,prednisone,recurrent disease,retreatment,salbutamol,sinusitis,thorax radiography,tobi,tobramycin,treatment response,upper respiratory tract infection,wheezing",NA,"{Inhaled tobramycin solution-associated recurrent eosinophilia and severe persistent bronchospasm in a patient with cystic fibrosis: A case report}","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l46420093 http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2431-7-11 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=14712431{\&}id=doi:10.1186{\%}2f1471-2431-7-11{\&}atitle=inhaled+tobramycin+so","7","2007",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"maybe","jake","no","ayomide","mushtaq","mushtaq","yes",NA,NA

"29","3557","maybe","chebabo2014","article","Background: Antimicrobial resistance is a growing global challenge to human health. The emerging New Delhi metallo-$\beta$-lactamase (NDM), an acquired class B carbapenemase has gain public attention due to its extended hydrolysis of $\beta$-lactams including carbapenems. Objective: We report the first isolates of this emerging resistance mechanism in our hospitals in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Methods: Between September and October 2013, four carbapenem-resistant strains, three Enterobacter cloacae and one Providencia rettgeri were isolated in our clinical Microbiology Lab from distinct patients hospitalized at different hospitals located at two distinct cities of Rio de Janeiro. MIC was determined by CLSI broth microdilution method. Specific primers were used for PCR detection of blaNDM, blaKPC, blaGES, blaSPM, blaGIM, blaSIM, blaCTX-M, blaSHV, blaTEM, blaOXA-48, armA, rmtA, rmtB, rmtC, rmtD, rmtG, npmA followed by DNA sequencing. Clonal relatedness among E. cloacae isolates was examined by PFGE. Plasmid extraction was performed by Kieser protocol. Conjugation with E. coli J53 (LacZ- Nalr Rifr) and hybridization with specific probes were used to determine transfer of carbapenem resistance. The species identification was confirmed by MALDI-ToF MS{\textregistered} and 16sRNA DNA sequencing. Results: Of the four isolates, three were from public hospital and one from a private hospital. Enterobacter cloacae were isolated in blood, ascitic fluid and rectal swab and one Providencia rettgeri was isolated in urine. All strains showed higher resistant rates to carbapenems and to broad-spectrum cephalosporins and P. rettgeri was resistant to polymyxin B, as expected. blaNDM-1 and blaTEM-1 were identified in all isolates. All E. cloacae also produced blaCTX-M-15, and showed different PFGE pattern. blaKPC-2 was identified in one E. cloacae isolate (isolate E134) and armA gene was detected in E. cloacae gentamicin and amikacin resistant (isolate E133). Conjugation of blaNDM-1 was achieved in 2/4 isolates, E. cloacae (isolate E134) and P. rettgeri (isolate E132). The hybridization revealed that blaKPC-2 was located in the E. cloacae chromosome. The genetic location of blaNDM-1 is being confirmed among the isolates evaluated. Conclusion: Those isolates in Rio de Janeiro, showed the importance of correct molecular study of isolates that express carbapenenem resistance in the clinical Microbiology Lab, as, although the blaNDM-1 has been previously reported in Enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates in our country, this study constitutes the first one that identified the co-association of blaNDM-1 and blaKPC-2 in E. cloacae. The results can lead to improve infection control measures to avoid its spread in hospital environment.","A Chebabo and M G Quiles and T T Rocchetti and L C Fehlberg and E J U Kusano and D Thielmann and R M G Pereira and O Fernandes and A C Gales and A C C Pignatari","0009-9147","Clinical Chemistry","American,Brazil,DNA,DNA sequence,Enterobacter cloacae,Enterobacteriaceae,Escherichia coli,Providencia rettgeri,amikacin,antibiotic resistance,ascites fluid,blood,broth dilution,carbapenem,carbapenem derivative,carbapenemase,cephalosporin derivative,chromosome,city,clinical chemistry,conjugation,extraction,gene,gentamicin,health,hospital,human,hybridization,hydrolysis,infection control,laboratory,lactam,microbiology,minimum inhibitory concentration,patient,penicillinase,plasmid,polymyxin B,private hospital,public hospital,species identification,transfer RNA,urine","s146","{The first isolates of the emerging New Delhi metallo-$\beta$-lactamase in a laboratory in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil}","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l72268886 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=00099147{\&}id=doi:{\&}atitle=the+first+isolates+of+the+emerging+new+delhi+metallo-$\beta$-lactamase+in+a+laboratory+in+ri","60","2014","10",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"yes","allison","maybe","erica","erica","mushtaq","yes",NA,NA

However, due to lack of systematic analysis using multiple markers the available information on the genomic diversity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in India is limited. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Thus, 65 M. tuberculosis isolates from New Delhi, India were analyzed by spoligotyping, MIRU-VNTR, large deletion PCR typing and single nucleotide polymorphism analysis (SNP). The Central Asian (CAS) 1 {\_}DELHI sub-lineage was the most prevalent sub-lineage comprising 46.2{\%} (n = 30) of all isolates, with shared-type (ST) 26 being the most dominant genotype comprising 24.6{\%} (n = 16) of all isolates. Other sub-lineages observed were: East-African Indian (EAI)-5 (9.2{\%}, n = 6), EAI6{\_}BGD1 (6.2{\%}, n = 4), EAI3{\_}IND, CAS and T1 with 6.2{\%} each (n = 4 each), Beijing (4.6{\%}, n = 3), CAS2 (3.1{\%}, n = 2), and X1 and X2 with 1 isolate each. Genotyping results from five isolates (7.7{\%}) did not match any existing spoligopatterns, and one isolate, ST124, belonged to an undefined lineage. Twenty-six percent of the isolates belonged to the TbD1+ PGG1 genogroup. SNP analysis of the pncA gene revealed a CAS-lineage specific silent mutation, S65S, which was observed for all CAS-lineage isolates (except two ST26 isolates) and in 1 orphan. Mutations in the pncA gene, conferring resistance to pyrazinamide, were observed in 15.4{\%} of all isolates. Collectively, mutations in the rpoB gene, the katG gene and in both rpoB and katG genes, conferring resistance to rifampicin and isoniazid, respectively, were more frequent in CAS1{\_}DELHI isolates compared to non-CAS{\_}DELHI isolates (OR: 3.1, CI95{\%} [1.11, 8.70], P = 0.045). The increased frequency of drug-resistance could not be linked to the patients' history of previous anti-tuberculosis treatment (OR: 1.156, CI95{\%} [0.40, 3.36], P = 0.79). Fifty-six percent of all new tuberculosis patients had mutations in either the katG gene or the rpoB gene, or in both katG and rpoB genes. CONCLUSION: CAS1{\_}DELHI isolates circulating in New Delhi, India have a high frequency of mutations in the rpoB and katG genes. A silent mutation (S65S) in the pncA gene can be used as a putative genetic marker for CAS-lineage isolates.","R Stavrum and V P Myneedu and V K Arora and N Ahmed and H M Grewal","1932-6203","PLoS ONE","Bacterial Typing Techniques,Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial/*genetics,Genes, Bacterial/drug effects/genetics,Humans,India,Mutation,Mycobacterium tuberculosis/genetics/*isolation {\&} p,Polymerase Chain Reaction,Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide,Pyrazinamide,Tuberculosis/epidemiology/microbiology","e4540","{In-depth molecular characterization of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from New Delhi--predominance of drug resistant isolates of the 'modern' (TbD1) type}",NA,"4","2009","2","1932-6203stavrum, ruthmyneedu, vithal prasadarora, virendra kahmed, niyazgrewal, harleen m sjournal articleresearch support, non-u.s. gov'tunited statesplos one. 2009;4(2):e4540. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0004540. epub 2009 feb 23.","10.1371/journal.pone.0004540","2/24/09","eng","19234602","no","erica","maybe","nchedo","allison","mushtaq","yes",NA,NA

She was transferred to our hospital 5 days after the cesarean for severe colitis. A rapid test of stool for Clostridium difficile toxin A and B was positive. Although oral vancomycin (0.5-2.0 g/day) and intravenous immunoglobulin (5 g/day) were administered after her transfer, 7 days after admission emergency exploratory surgery was performed because of poor response to therapy. Bowel perforation was noted and a temporary colostomy was created without colectomy. Vancomycin (2.0 g/day) was administered via the colostomy, in addition to a vancomycin enema (2.0 g/day), oral metronidazole (1500 mg/day), and oral vancomycin (2.0 g/day). Three days after the operation, linezolid (1200 mg/day IV) was added. She was treated with antibiotics against C. difficile for a total of 18 days after the operation. The same strain was not isolated from other patients in the same ward. Microbiological analysis of the isolate revealed housekeeping gene (tpi), toxin A gene (tcdA), toxin B gene (tcdB), and binary toxin gene (cdtA and cdtB).

Transmission of blaKPC, the plasmid-borne KPC gene, can be mediated by clonal spread and horizontal transfer. Here, we report the complete nucleotide sequences of two novel blaKPC-3-harboring IncFIA plasmids, pBK30661 and pBK30683. pBK30661 is 74 kb in length, with a mosaic plasmid structure; it exhibits homologies to several other plasmids but lacks the plasmid transfer operon (tra) and the origin of transfer (oriT) that are required for plasmid transfer. pBK30683 is a conjugative plasmid with a cointegrated plasmid structure, comprising a 72-kb element that highly resembles pBK30661 ({\textgreater}99.9{\%} nucleotide identities) and an extra 68-kb element that harbors tra and oriT. A PCR scheme was designed to detect the distribution of blaKPC-harboring IncFIA (pBK30661-like and pBK30683-like) plasmids in a collection of clinical Enterobacteriaceae isolates from 10 hospitals in New Jersey and New York. KPC-harboring IncFIA plasmids were found in 20{\%} of 491 K. pneumoniae isolates, and all carried blaKPC-3. pBK30661-like plasmids were identified mainly in the epidemic sequence type 258 (ST258) K. pneumoniae clone, while pBK30683-like plasmids were widely distributed in ST258 and other K. pneumoniae sequence types and among non-K. pneumoniae Enterobacteriaceae species. This suggests that both clonal spread and horizontal plasmid transfer contributed to the dissemination of blaKPC-harboring IncFIA plasmids in our area. Further studies are needed to understand the distribution of this plasmid group in other health care regions and to decipher the origins of pBK30661-like and pBK30683-like plasmids.

Except for Corynebacterium diphtheriae, they were once considered contaminants of mucosa. Recent publications in medical bacteriology have highlighted the importance of several species, such as C. aurimucosum. To the best of our knowledge, we report the first isolation of this strain from urine. Case presentation: We report a case of a patient with a urinary tract infection with C. aurimucosum. We isolated this bacterium from a 52-year-old man of Wolof ethniticity (an ethnic group in Senegal, West Africa) at the regional hospital of Saint Louis, Senegal. Microscopic examination of his total urine sample showed coryneform Gram-positive bacilli associated with a high leukocyte reaction. After repeated isolation of the corynebacteria in three samples from the patient's urine, it was identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The strain was susceptible to antibiotics, except for penicillin and co-trimoxazole. The potential infectious role of these commensal species in several infections should be taken into consideration. Conclusions: This case highlights the significant proportion of species in the genus Corynebacterium other than dyphteriae in the infectious process. The use of mass spectrometry for identification highlights the originality of this work and the importance of these new diagnostic tools that are unavailable in most health facilities of countries with limited resources. We share the results of our method of identification of the isolated bacteria. This case should prompt attention to these rare bacteria, which can cause severe infections.","S Lo and I Thiam and B Fall and A Ba-Diallo and O F Diallo and R Diagne and M L Dia and R Ka and A M Sarr and A I Sow","1752-1947","Journal of Medical Case Reports","Corynebacterium,Corynebacterium aurimucosum,Escherichia coli infection,Senegal,Wolof (people),adult,agricultural worker,antibiotic resistance,antibiotic sensitivity,article,case report,cefalotin,ceftriaxone,chloramphenicol,ciprofloxacin,cotrimoxazole,cystourethrography,dysuria,erythromycin,hematuria,human,imipenem,lincomycin,male,matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time o,middle aged,nonhuman,penicillin derivative,polygamy,priority journal,pristinamycin,tetracycline,treatment outcome,urethra stenosis,urethroplasty,urinalysis,urinary frequency,urinary tract infection,vancomycin",NA,"{Urinary tract infection with Corynebacterium aurimucosum after urethroplasty stricture of the urethra: A case report}","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l605176578 http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13256-015-0638-0 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=17521947{\&}id=doi:10.1186{\%}2fs13256-015-0638-0{\&}atitle=urinary+tract+","9","2015","1",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"yes","jake","maybe","mushtaq","mushtaq","mushtaq","yes",NA,NA

Treatment was based on the World Health Organization guidelines, with the inclusion of a new proposal for the use of a combination of antituberculosis drugs (imipenem and linezolid). In the cases studied, we show the challenge of creating an acceptable, effective treatment regimen including drugs that are more toxic, are more expensive, and are administered for longer periods. We also show that treatment costs are significantly higher for such patients, which could have an impact on health care systems, even after hospital discharge. We highlight the fact that in extreme cases, such as those reported here, hospitalization at a referral center seems to be the most effective strategy for providing appropriate treatment and increasing the chance of cure.

It is a prominent clinical pathogen in northern Australia with potential for transmission within the local hospital setting. AIM: To determine epidemiological characteristics of S. aureus carriage within the Royal Darwin Hospital. METHODS: We screened two patient groups: an 'admission group' recruited within 48 h of admission; and an 'inpatient group' recruited five or more days after admission. S. aureus isolates were characterized by antibiotic susceptibility testing and genotyped by a multi-locus sequence type-based high-resolution melting scheme. FINDINGS: S. aureus carriage on admission was 30.7{\%} of 225 compared with 34.8{\%} among 201 inpatients, with MRSA carriage of 2.2{\%} and 18.9{\%} respectively. We isolated CA-MRSA from 0.9{\%} and 10.4{\%}, and healthcare-associated (HCA)-MRSA from 1.3{\%} and 9.0{\%} of the admission and inpatient groups, respectively. Among the inpatient group, hospital-associated ST239 was the most common MRSA strain. CA-MRSA was represented by one clonal complex (CC) in the admission group (CC5) and seven CCs in the inpatient group (CC1, 93, 5, 6, 30, 75, 88). CONCLUSION: Inpatient carriage of multiple CA-MRSA lineages suggests selection for and transmission within the hospital of not only typical HCA-MRSA, but also diverse CA-MRSA strains.","L Brennan and R A Lilliebridge and A C Cheng and P M Giffard and B J Currie and S Y C Tong","0195-67011532-2939","J Hosp Infect",",Adult,Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology,Australia,Australia/epidemiology,Carrier State/*epidemiology/microbiology,Community-Acquired Infections/*epidemiology/microb,Cross-Sectional Studies,Female,Humans,Male,Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus/*isola,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Middle Aged,Prevalence,Staphylococcal Infections/*epidemiology/microbiolo,adult,antibiotic sensitivity,article,bacterial transmission,bacterium carrier,bacterium isolation,community associated methicillin resistant Staphyl,controlled study,female,high resolution melting analysis,hospital admission,hospital infection,hospital patient,human,major clinical study,male,methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus,molecular cloning,molecular epidemiology,multilocus sequence typing,nonhuman","205--211","{Community-associated meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus carriage in hospitalized patients in tropical northern Australia}","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l52394393 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2012.10.014 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=01956701{\&}id=doi:10.1016{\%}2fj.jhin.2012.10.014{\&}atitle=community-ass","83","2013","3","from duplicate 2 (community-associated meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus carriage in hospitalized patients in tropical northern australia - brennan, l; lilliebridge, r a; cheng, a c; giffard, p m; currie, b j; tong, s y)1532-2939brennan, llilliebridge, r acheng, a cgiffard, p mcurrie, b jtong, s y cjournal articleresearch support, non-u.s. gov'tenglandj hosp infect. 2013 mar;83(3):205-11. doi: 10.1016/j.jhin.2012.10.014. epub 2013 jan 15.","10.1016/j.jhin.2012.10.014","1/22/13","eng","23332351","yes","allison","yes","nchedo","nchedo","mushtaq","yes",NA,NA

"41","23112","yes","yoo2012","article","Objectives: Cases of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae are rare but their incidence is increasing in Korean hospitals. Various types of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, mostly Klebsiella pneumoniae, KPC-2, NDM-1, IMP-1, and VIM-2, were detected during a lab-based investigation in Korea. New Delhi metallo-betalactamase 1(NDM-1) -producing E. coli was first detected in one hospital in December 2011. Methods: Antimicrobial susceptibility tests and the MHT were performed according to CLSI methods and an imipenem disk synergy test was performed. NDM-1 genotype and other resistant genes were confirmed by PCR and sequencing using specific primers. For epidemiological analysis, PFGE types were determined by Xba-I restriction, and phylogenetic group PCR and MLST were performed. Results: One NDM-1-producing E. coli was isolated from a urine culture, and three isolates were recovered after surveillance of stool cultures from inpatients on the same ward. This hospital performed specific medical examinations for foreign patients. All patients were hospitalized 1-7 months before NDM-1 was isolated without history of overseas travel or medication. All the NDM-1-producing isolates were resistant to imipenem, meropenem, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, amikacin, ceftazidime, and cefotaxime, but were susceptible to colistin and tigecycline. TEM, SHV, CTX-M-15, DHA-1, OXA-1 genes were detected. PFGE analysis showed 98{\%} similarity, indicating clonality. All isolates belonged to phylogenetic group B1, ST101, which is a rare sequence type in Korea. Conclusion: This is the first case of NDM-1-producing E. coli in Korea. All isolates were identified from the four patients sharing the room. The transmission route of the organism was determined to be personal contact among the patients in the hospital, although the origin was not clear. However, E. coli B1-ST101 was reported as the major international clone of NDM-1-producing E. coli from England, Pakistan, Canada, Australia, and after considering the patients' epidemiological data, it was suspected that this organism was imported. Thus, continuous surveillance and hospital infection control would be important to prevent the spread of this organism.","J S Yoo and H M Kim and H S Koo and J W Yang and H S Chung and H K Park and G T Chung and Y S Lee","1198-743x","Clinical Microbiology and Infection","Australia,Canada,Enterobacteriaceae,Escherichia coli,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Korea,Pakistan,South Korea,United Kingdom,amikacin,antibiotic sensitivity,carbapenemase,cefotaxime,ceftazidime,ciprofloxacin,clonal variation,clone,colistin,drug therapy,epidemiological data,feces culture,gene,genotype,gentamicin,hospital,hospital infection,hospital patient,human,imipenem,infection,infection control,inosine phosphate,medical examination,meropenem,metallo beta lactamase,microbiology,organisms,patient,tigecycline,travel,urine culture,ward","710","{First isolation of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1-producing Escherichia coli ST101-B1 in South Korea}","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l70824125 http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-0691.2012.03802.x http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=1198743x{\&}id=doi:10.1111{\%}2fj.1469-0691.2012.03802.x{\&}atitle=f","18","2012",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"yes","jake","yes","ayomide","ayomide","mushtaq","yes",NA,NA

Objective: To investigate the clinical presentations of various Nocardia infections based on the 16S ribosomal RNA gene of the isolate, as well as related risk factors and susceptibility patterns to antimicrobial agents Methods: Thirteen patients with a diagnosis of nocardiosis were included in the present study. Seven Nocardia species were identified by 16S ribosomal RNA. Susceptibility testing was performed using six antimicrobial agents. Results: Five patients were immunocompromised, and eight were immunocompetent with predisposing factors including cystic fibrosis, tuberculosis and ophthalmic infections. Nocardia caused pulmonary infections in eight patients (61.5{\%}), invasive systemic infections in three patients (23{\%}) and local (ophthalmic) infections in two patients (15.4{\%}). In the patients with pulmonary disease, nocardiosis was caused by six species (Nocardia cyriacigeorgica, Nocardia otitidiscaviarum, Nocardia farcinica, Nocardia carnea, Nocardia testacea and Nocardia asiatica). The seventh species identified in the present study was Nocardia crassostreae. Discussion: N crassostreae is a multidrug-resistant organism that was reported to be an emerging human pathogen causing invasive nocardiosis in a patient with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. N farcinica was isolated from blood in a patient with breast cancer. None of the Nocardia isolates were resistant to linezolid. One N otitidiscaviarum isolate was a multidrug-resistant organism. All patients in the present study were treated with the appropriate antibiotics and their condition resolved without further sequelae. Conclusions: The present study is the first report on N crassostreae as a human pathogen. The detection of multidrug-resistant species necessitate molecular identification and susceptibility testing, and should be performed for all Nocardia infections.

We report the emergence of the newly described resistance mechanism conferred by New Delhi metallo-$\beta$-lactamase 1 (NDM-1) in Austria. NDM-1 positive Enterobacteriaceae (2x Klebsiella pneumoniae and 1x E. coli) has been detected in three patients at the University Hospital of Graz, Austria, with all three cases occurring within the last 6 months. Methods: NDM-1 shares very little identity with other metallob- lactamase (MBL) enzymes and Enterobacteriaceae with NDM-1 show high resistance to nearly all commonly used antibiotics. Primers for PCR detection of NDM-1 were designed based on GenBank (National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) database entry AB571289.1 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/300422615). Results: NDM-1 was detected in isolates of three patients, in two cases in K. pneumoniae, and one patient with NDM-1 positive E. coli. All threecases occurred between December 2009 and August 2010. Patient one (NDM-1 K. pneumoniae), a 30-year-old Austrian male was admitted to our University Hospital in November 2009. History revealed that he had suffered multiple open fractures of his upper and lower left leg and rectal laceration due to a motorcycle accident in Pakistan. In patient two the NDM-1 K. pneumoniae was detected in August 2010, the patient being a 14-year-old Kosovarian boy transferred from Kosovo to the Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Graz, with multiple intraabdominal abscess formations and peritonitis. He had undergone appendectomy in Pristina, Kosovo, in April 2010 and had developed abdominal sepsis consecutively. Patient number three (NDM-1 E. coli), a 56 year old male developed a necrotizing fasciitis when being in India in January 2010, after a short admittance at a hospital in New Delhi the patient was transferred to Austria. Conclusion: Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae with the newly described resistance enzyme NDM-1 have been recently shown to pose the potential of growing to a major public health problem worldwide. We report the emergence of NDM-1 among Enterobacteriaceae in Austria. During December 2009 and August 2010 two patients with K. pneumoniae carrying NDM-1 and one patient with NDM-1 E. coli were identified at the Medical University of Graz, Austria.","A J Grisold and G Zarfel and M HÌ¦nigl and T Valentin and H J Salzer and E Leitner and R Krause","1198-743x","Clinical Microbiology and Infection","Austria,Enterobacteriaceae,Escherichia coli,GenBank,India,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Pakistan,abdominal abscess,antibiotic agent,appendectomy,biotechnology,boy,data base,enzyme,hospital,hospital patient,human,identity,laceration,leg,male,national health organization,necrotizing fasciitis,open fracture,patient,pediatrics,penicillinase,peritonitis,public health problem,sepsis,traffic accident,university,university hospital","s137--s138","{Emergence of New Delhi metallo-$\beta$-lactamase (NDM-1)- Producing Enterobacteriaceae in Austria}","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l70599317 http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-0691.2011.03558.x http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=1198743x{\&}id=doi:10.1111{\%}2fj.1469-0691.2011.03558.x{\&}atitle=e","17","2011",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"yes","brooke","yes","nchedo","nchedo","mushtaq","yes",NA,NA

The ST258 KPC-KP strain exhibited a multiresistant antibiotic phenotype including co-resistance to gentamycin, colistin and tigecycline intermediate susceptibility. Isolates before and after treatment had different behaviour concerning their antibiotic susceptibility and the population analysis profile study. A progressive increase in the aminoglycosides (acquiring amicacin resistance) and $\beta$-lactam MICs, and a decreased susceptibility to fosfomycin was observed throughout the administration of combined antimicrobial regimens including meropenem. A high meropenem resistance KPC-KP homogeneous population (MIC 256 Jg/mL), could arise from the meropenem heterogeneous low-level resistance KPC-KP population (MIC 8 Jg/mL), by the selective pressure of the prolonged meropenem therapy. The kpc gene was inserted in a Tn4401 isoform a, and no transconjugants were detected.

Misuse and overuse of these drugs have contributed to phenomena known as antibiotic resistance. In this research, the antimicrobial resistance of the Shigella has been determined. This descriptive research analyzed registered laboratory data of patients referred to Fatemeh Zahra Hospital of the Bushehr, Iran. Shigella was isolated from their cultured sample from the year 2002-2008. In this study, the total of 121 registered Shigella collected from 2002-2008 were analyzed. There were 62 cases of S. sonnei, 46 cases of S. flexneri, eight cases of S. boydii and five cases of S. dysenteriae among them. Furthermore, two cases of Shigella sonnei were collected from the blood and the rest from the watery stools of the infected patients. The following is the resistance pattern of these organisms; to ciprofloxacin, 4.25{\%}; ceftizoxime, 8.62{\%}; nalidixic acid, 12.12{\%}; co-trimoxazole, 86.13{\%} and to tetracycline, 93.02{\%}. Results ofantibiogram showed that highest rate of drug resistance belongs to tetracycline and co-trimoxazole and the lowest belongs to ciprofloxacin and ceftizoxime. One of the important issue for clinicians, now a day is drug resistance of microorganisms. This phenomenon is increasing due to some factors such as improper use of antibiotics and irrational prescribing. These factors lead to development of new drug resistant species.","O Gharibi and S Zangene and N Mohammadi and K Mirzaei and A Karimi and A Gharibi and A Khajehiean","1028-8880 (print)

However, febrile neutropenia remains one of the important limiting factors in these patients especially with the emergence of resistant organisms. Choosing appropriate antimicrobials is possible only if we understand the local microbial spectrum and their sensitivity pattern. Aims: To study the likely etiologic agents and their antibiotic sensitivity pattern among systemic infections in children with cancer. Settings and Design: This is a prospective study. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted at a tertiary care center for pediatrics, in which culture samples representing blood stream infections and others like urinary tract infections sent from the Oncology services of the Hospital during the year of 2013 were analyzed. The microbiological profile and antibiotic sensitivity pattern of these isolates were studied. Results: There were 89 isolates that represented blood and urinary tract infections in neutropenic patients with cancer.Out of 89 positive cultures 76 were gram negative isolates. The most common gram negative bacterial isolates were Escherichia coli 33 (37{\%}), followed by Pseudomonas 21 (23.5{\%}). Acinetobacter grew in 2 patients (2.2{\%}). Extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL's), carbepenem resistant and pan-resistant organisms seen in 28 (31.4{\%}), 5 (5.6{\%}) and 2 cases (2.3{\%}) respectively. Over all Gram-positive organisms were 13/89 (12.3{\%}). Staphylococcus was the most common Gram-positive organism and methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus seen in 5each. Conclusion: Gram-negative organism is a common isolate in cancer children with febrile neutropenia, which is resistant to first-line antibiotic cefepime. Meropenem is most sensitive antibiotic and ESBL's are sensitive to piperacillin-tazobactam.","S Siddaiahgari and A Manikyam and K {Anand Kumar} and A Rauthan and R Ayyar and K A Kumar and A Rauthan and R Ayyar","0019-509x","Indian J Cancer",",*Drug Resistance,Acinetobacter,Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology,Bacteremia/drug therapy/*microbiology,Bacterial,Disk Diffusion Antimicrobial Tests,Escherichia coli,Febrile Neutropenia/*complications,Hospitals,Humans,Klebsiella,Neoplasms/*complications/therapy,Pediatric,Prospective Studies,Pseudomonas,Tertiary Care Centers,Urinary Tract Infections/*microbiology,aminoglycoside derivative,amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid,antibiotic sensitivity,bacterial infection,bacterium culture,bloodstream infection,cancer patient,carbapenem derivative,cephalosporin derivative,child,childhood cancer,cohort analysis,conference paper,extended spectrum beta lactamase,febrile neutropenia,human,major clinical study,methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus,methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus,nonhuman,observational study,pediatric hospital,piperacillin,piperacillin plus tazobactam,prospective study,tazobactam,tertiary care center,urinary tract infection","403--405","{Spectrum of systemic bacterial infections during febrile neutropenia in pediatric oncology patients in tertiary care pediatric center}","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l608424096 http://dx.doi.org/10.4103/0019-509x.175367 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=19984774{\&}id=doi:10.4103{\%}2f0019-509x.175367{\&}atitle=spectrum+of+syst","51","2014","4","from duplicate 1 (spectrum of systemic bacterial infections during febrile neutropenia in pediatric oncology patients in tertiary care pediatric center - siddaiahgari, s; manikyam, a; kumar, k a; rauthan, a; ayyar, r)

CRKP infections frequently are resistant to a majority of antimicrobial agents and have an increased risk for morbidity and mortality. The West Virginia Bureau for Public Health (WVBPH) conducted field investigations to identify all cases, characterize risk factors for infection, and abstract data for a matched case-control study. Nineteen case-patients and 38 control patients were identified. Infection with CRKP was associated with admission from or prior stay at a local long-term--care facility (LTCF A). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis indicated that all five hospital A clinical specimens and all 11 point prevalence survey isolates from LTCF A were closely related. This is the first outbreak of CRKP identified in West Virginia. Recommendations to LTCF A included the following: 1) initiate surveillance for multidrug resistant organisms; 2) revise and improve infection prevention and control activities within the facility; 3) educate residents and their families, physicians, and staff members about CRKP; and 4) identify qualified personnel to coordinate infection control functions within the facility. Although LTCF A has made significant improvements, the outbreak investigation is ongoing. Additional site visits have been conducted, and additional colonized residents have been identified; the last clinical case was detected in July. These findings demonstrate the interconnectedness of the health-care system and factors potentially contributing to transmission of infection.

These strains were isolated from patients hospitalized in Rouen University Hospital between August 2004 and December 2006 and were resistant to cefepime and/or ceftazidime (PMR) by a mechanism not only related to overproduction of the cephalosporinase. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical strains of PMR were characterized by conventional biochemical methods, antibiotic susceptibility testing by disk diffusion in agar with or without cloxacillin and RAPD for genetic comparison. Identification of beta-lactamase was performed by PCR amplification followed by sequencing of bla genes. RESULTS: All strains produced the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) TEM-116. Epidemiological study identified eight unrelated strains, eight related strains originating from a single unit, three related strains isolated in different wards and five related strains coproducing TEM-116 and SHV-2a but isolated in different units. Detection of ESBL in these strains was difficult due to a low level of ESBL production. CONCLUSION: This is the first report of TEM-116 in France in 24 strains of P. aeruginosa and its association with SHV-2a in five cases. SHV-2a has been described in P. aeruginosa in France but not TEM-116 which was recently reported in this species, in China and in Netherlands (in a strain coproducing SHV-12). ESBL detection in PMR remains indispensable since these strains can cause therapeutic failures.","M David and J F Lemeland and S Boyer","0369-8114 (print)

"65","15560","yes","onken2015a","article","Background Bloodstream infections (BSI) are frequent and cause high case-fatality rates. Urgent antibiotic treatment can save patients' lives, but antibiotic resistance can render antibiotic therapy futile. This study is the first to collect epidemiological data on BSI from Unguja, Zanzibar. Methods Clinical data and blood for culturing and susceptibility testing of isolated microbes were obtained from 469 consecutively enrolled neonates, children and adults presenting with signs of systemic infections at Mnazi Mmoja Hospital (MMH), Zanzibar. Results Pathogenic bacteria were recovered fromthe blood of 14{\%}of the patients (66/469). The most frequently isolated microbes were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter spp. and Staphylococcus aureus. Infections were community-acquired in 56 patients (85{\%}) and hospital-acquired in 8 (12{\%}) (datamissing for 2 patients). BSI caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae (E. coli, K. pneumoniae) was found in 5 cases, of which 3 were community-acquired and 2 hospital-acquired. Three of these patients died. Six of 7 Salmonella Typhi isolates were multidrug resistant. Streptococcus pneumoniae was found in one patient only. Conclusions This is the first report of ESBL-producing bacteria causing BSI from the Zanzibar archipelago. Our finding of community-acquired BSI caused by ESBL-producing bacteria is alarming, as it implies that these difficult-to-treat bacteria have already spread in the society. In the local setting these infections are virtually impossible to cure. The findings call for increased awareness of rational antibiotic use, infection control and surveillance to counteract the problem of emerging antimicrobial resistance.","A Onken and A K Said and M Jorstad and P A Jenum and B Blomberg and M JÃ¸rstad and P A Jenum and B Blomberg","1932-6203","PLoS ONE",",*Drug Resistance,Acinetobacter,Adolescent,Adult,Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology,Bacteremia/drug therapy/*epidemiology/microbiology,Child,Community-Acquired Infections/drug therapy/*epidem,Cross Infection/drug therapy/*epidemiology/microbi,Escherichia coli,Female,Humans,Infant,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Male,Microbial,Newborn,Preschool,Prevalence,Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi,Staphylococcus aureus,Streptococcus pneumoniae,Tanzania,Tanzania/epidemiology,adolescent,adult,ampicillin,antibiotic resistance,antibiotic sensitivity,article,blood culture,bloodstream infection,cefotaxime,ceftazidime,child,chloramphenicol,ciprofloxacin,community acquired infection,cotrimoxazole,epidemiological data,extended spectrum beta lactamase producing Enterob,female,gentamicin,hospital infection,human,infant,major clinical study,male,meropenem,mortality,multidrug resistance,newborn,nonhuman,oxacillin,penicillin G,piperacillin plus tazobactam,preschool child,prevalence","e0145632","{Prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of microbes causing bloodstream infections in unguja, Zanzibar}","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l608043455 http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0145632 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=19326203{\&}id=doi:10.1371{\%}2fjournal.pone.0145632{\&}atitle=prevalen","10","2015","12","from duplicate 2 (prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of microbes causing bloodstream infections in unguja, zanzibar - onken, a; said, a k; jorstad, m; jenum, p a; blomberg, b)

METHOD: Over a period of one year, 257 urine samples were analyzed for bacteria by standard procedures. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of isolated bacteria was done using the disk diffusion method. RESULTS: The isolated bacteria were Escherichia coli (40.3{\%}), coagulase negative Staphylococcus (16.1{\%}), Klebsiella spp (11.2{\%}), Staphylococcus aureus (8{\%}), Group A Streptococcus (8{\%}) and Klebsiella oxytoca (8{\%}). Antibiotic susceptibility testing was done using the disc diffusion method on Mueller-Hinton agar. It revealed a high resistance to ampicillin (84.5{\%}) and cotrimoxazole (68.5{\%}) among the Gram negative bacilli. Gram positive cocci showed resistance to Nalidixic acid (81{\%}) and cotrimoxazole (69{\%}). E. coli was susceptible to most of the drugs but 84{\%} of the strains were resistant to ampicillin, and 68{\%} to cotrimoxazole. All isolates were sensitive to Nicene. CONCLUSION: The high levels of ampicillin and cotrimoxazole resistance in E. coli and other enterobactericiae suggest the need to perform urinalysis and antibiotic susceptibility testing in all patients.

"67","23766","maybe","na:93","article","Meningoccocal disease causes substantial morbidity and mortality; approximately 10{\%} of cases are fatal. Among those who survive, 10{\%}-15{\%} have long-term sequelae. Nasopharyngeal carriage of Neisseria meningitidis is a precursor to disease; however, the majority of carriers do not develop disease. Household and other close contacts of persons with meningococcal disease have a higher risk for carriage and therefore invasive disease. These persons should receive antibiotic chemoprophylaxis to eliminate nasopharyngeal carriage of N. meningitidis as soon as possible. The rate of secondary disease for close contacts is highest immediately after onset of disease in the index patient; secondary cases rarely occur after 14 days. Ciprofloxacin, a second-generation fluoroquinolone, is an effective single-dose oral chemoprophylaxis agent. Although isolated cases of ciprofloxacin-resistant meningoccocal disease have been described in Argentina, Australia, China, France, India, and Spain, resistance has not been reported in North America. This report describes a cluster of three cases of fluoroquinolone-resistant meningococcal disease that occurred among residents of the border area of North Dakota and Minnesota during January 2007-January 2008. The first of these cases was epidemiologically linked and had closely related molecular features to a 2006 case of fluoroquinolone-susceptible meningococcal disease that occurred in the same geographic region. Until further notice, ciprofloxacin should not be used for chemoprophylaxis of close contacts of persons with meningococcal disease in selected counties in North Dakota and Minnesota. Ceftriaxone, rifampin, and azithromycin are alternative agents.",NA,"0149-2195","MMWR.
