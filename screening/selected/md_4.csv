Using a comprehensive strain biobank spanning 3 decades, we sought to determine the prevalence and stability of chronic P. aeruginosa infection in an adult population. P. aeruginosa isolates from sputum samples collected at initial enrollment in our adult clinic and at the most recent clinic visit were examined by a combination of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing and compared against a collection of established transmissible and local non-CF bronchiectasis (nCFB) isolates. A total of 372 isolates from 107 patients, spanning 674 patient-years, including 66 patients with matched isolates from initial and final encounters, were screened. A novel clone with increased antibacterial resistance, termed the prairie epidemic strain (PES), was found in 29{\%} (31/107 patients) of chronically infected patients referred from multiple prairie-based CF centers. This isolate was not found in those diagnosed with CF as adults or in a control population with nCFB. While 90{\%} (60/66 patients) of patients had stable infection over a mean of 10.8 years, five patients experienced strain displacement of unique isolates, with PES occurring within 2 years of transitioning to adult care. PES has been present in our cohort since at least 1987, is unique to CF, generally establishes chronic infection during childhood, and has been found in patients at the time of transition of patients from multiple prairie-based CF clinics, suggesting broad endemicity. Studies are under way to evaluate the clinical implications of PES infection. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2014, American Society for Microbiology.

Several mutations in genes encoding SHV, tem and CTX-M beta-lactamases have been associated with ESBL activity. This paper describes a new SHV mutation in ESBL-producing strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated in Kuwait. The study included 13 K. penumoniae strains isolated from patients admitted to the Amiri hospital of Kuwait. The production of ESBL in all strains was confirmed by Vitek system and E-test. All the ESBL genes were amplified by PCR and examined by DNA sequencing. All these ESBL-positive isolates were resistant to ceftazidime and cefotaxime. DNA sequencing revealed an A815G point mutation in the bla (SHV )gene causing an asparagine (AAT) to aspartic acid (GAT) mutation at position 253 of the enzyme. This new mutation was assigned the unique number SHV-112, and the Genebank accession number EU477409. This study reports a new mutation in the SHV gene in K. pneumoniae with ESBL capability.

1359,YES,Bakour2014,Article,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular support of resistance to carbapenems, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones in Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates collected from Yemen hospital. METHODS: Three A. baumannii were isolated in February 2013 from three patients hospitalized at Al-Thawra University Hospital in Sana'a, Yemen. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed using the disk diffusion and E-test methods. Carbapenemase production was carried out by the modified Hodge test (MHT) and imipenem-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) methods. Carbapenem, aminoglycoside, and fluoroquinolone resistance determinants were studied by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. The epidemiological relatedness of the three strains was studied using multilocus sequence typing (MLST). RESULTS: The isolates were resistant to almost all antibiotics tested with very high imipenem, amikacin, and ciprofloxacin minimum inhibitory concentrations ({\textgreater}32, {\textgreater}256, and {\textgreater}32 mg/L, respectively). The microbiological tests showed that the three A. baumannii were MHT positive, besides, the activity of beta-lactamases was not inhibited by EDTA. All the three isolates contained the naturally occurring bla(OXA-51)-like gene and the bla(OXA-23)-like carbapenemase-encoding gene. The 16S rRNA methylase armA gene was detected in the three isolates. In addition, screening for genes encoding the aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (AMEs) demonstrated that one isolate contained the acetyltransferase gene aac(6')-Ib. Fluoroquinolone resistance was associated with a single mutation Ser83Leu in the quinolone resistance determining region of the gyrA gene in all isolates. The MLST showed that the sequence type (ST) obtained corresponds to ST2 for the three strains. CONCLUSIONS: Here we report the first identification of multidrug-resistant A. baumannii isolates harboring the bla(OXA-23)-like gene, AMEs [aac(6')-Ib], and the 16S rRNA methylase (armA) in the Yemen hospital.",S Bakour and S A Alsharapy and A Touati and J M Rolain,"1931-8448

Patients and Methods: Prospective study involving anemic/dyspeptic adult patients with positive 13C Urea Breath Test (UBT), which were divided in two groups: A-no previous Hp treatment (primary resistance); B-previous, failed, Hp treatment (secondary resistance). All patients were submitted to upper digestive endoscopy with biopsies for isolation of Hp. Genotyping and antibiotic susceptibility were determined. Patients received standard treatment protocol (Group APantoprazol + Amoxicillin + Clarithromycin, 14 days; Group B-Pantoprazol + Amoxicillin + Levofloxacin, 10 days). Hp eradication was assessed with UBT after 8-12 weeks. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS v17.0. Results: Ninety eight patients (Male/Female-28/70; mean age-42 ¬± 14 years; Groups A/B-59/39) completed the protocol. Eradication was successful in 62.2{\%} (Group A-71.2{\%}; Group B-48.7{\%}; p = .025).

During the course of treatment, the patient reported chronic intermittent prophylactic use of oral ciprofloxacin. While fluoroquinolones typically provide excellent postoperative coverage, Staphylococcus organisms have a growing antibiotic resistance to fluoroquinolones, and MRSA may become a more prevalent organism in corneal infections. Chronic subtherapeutic fluoroquinolone use can increase the mutational resistance of Staphylococcus to fluoroquinolone and methicillin.

16836,MAYBE,Pourabbas2016,Article,"Acinetobacter baumannii is an important opportunistic bacterial pathogen responsible for serious infections in hospitalized patients. From a total of 78 consecutive non-repetitive Acinetobacter spp. isolates from patients with blood infections, 61 were carbapenem resistant, which were positive for blaOXA-51-like (96.7{\%}), blaOXA-23-like (77{\%}), blaOXA-58-like (8.1{\%}) and blaOXA-40-like genes (32.8{\%}) by multiplex PCR. The isolates were identified as A. baumannii (n559) and Acinetobacter nosocomialis (n52). Also, we found a case of Acinetobacter junii, causing bacteraemia, that possessed the IMP gene. High levels of resistance were observed to fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, tigecycline and to the beta-lactam antibiotics, including piperacillin/tazobactam and ampicillin/sulbactam. ISAba1 was present in 96.7{\%} of all Acinetobacter calcoaceticus‚Äìbaumannii complex (Acb) isolates. Also, 33 (54.1{\%}) and 23 (37.7{\%}) isolates harboured ISAba1 upstream of blaOXA-23-like and blaOXA-51-like genes, respectively, though this was not observed in A. nosocomialis isolates. No relationship was observed between the presence of ISAba1 upstream of oxacillinase genes and the level of carbapenem resistance in all Acb isolates.

Antimicrobial resistance leads to treatment failure of hospital infections caused by E. coli. Production of extended-spectrum $\beta$-lactamases (ESBLs) is one of the major causes of antibiotic resistance in these bacteria. This study aimed to investigate the frequency of blaTEM and blaCTX-M genes in ESBL-producing E. coli strains isolated from clinical specimens of patients admitted to six hospitals in the north of Iran. A total of 160 E. coli strains were isolated from various clinical samples of hospitalised patients. Antibiotic resistance patterns were determined by the Kirby‚ÄìBauer disk diffusion method. The double-disk phenotypic confirmatory test was carried out amongst $\beta$-lactam-resistant isolates to detect ESBL-producing strains. Plasmid DNA of ESBL-producing strains was extracted and subjected to PCR for detection of the blaTEM and blaCTX-M genes, and isolates were extensively verified by sequencing. The highest resistance rate was to amoxicillin; all E. coli isolates (100{\%}) were susceptible to imipenem. Amongst the 160 clinical E. coli isolates, 83 (51.9{\%}) were ESBL-positive, of which 27 (32.5{\%}) and 72 (86.7{\%}) were positive for blaTEM and blaCTX-M, respectively. This study is the first report of an ESBL phenotype disseminated in hospitals in the north of Iran. These findings showed that there was a direct relationship between the development of resistance to $\beta$-lactam antibiotics and production of TEM and CTX-M enzymes.",M Haghighatpanah and A S {Mozaffari Nejad} and A Mojtahedi and N Amirmozafari and H Zeighami,"2213-7173

This study was undertaken to detect the production of NDM-1 metallobetalactamase (MBL) in Enterobacteriaceae at a tertiary care centre in India. Methods: One hundred and eleven clinically significant Enterobacteriaceae resistant to one of the cephalosporins subclass III were collected during the period April-October 2010. They included Klebsiella pneumoniae -52, Escherichia coli -25, Citrobacter freundii- 16, Enterobacter cloacae -16 and Providencia rettgeri -2, isolated from blood (23), respiratory secretions (24), exudative specimens (19) and urine (45) of patients in Intensive care units (ICU) and non-ICU settings. Susceptibility to imipenem and meropenem was performed by disc diffusion and Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determined by broth microdilution with suitable controls. Results were interpreted according to CLSI January 2011 guidelines. Carbapenamase production was screened by Modified Hodge test (MHT) and MBL production by inhibitor potentiated disk diffusion tests with ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) .The isolates were subjected to Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of blaNDM-1.Gene sequencing was performed. Results: BlaNDM-1 was detected in 64 isolates. While the MHT was positive in 57 of them, the MBL screening test was positive in 43. The sensitivity of these tests were 89.1{\%} and 79.6{\%} .MIC90 values for imipenem and meropenem were 4 and 2 mg/L respectively. BlaNDM-1 positive isolates were from blood (17), exudative specimens (13), respiratory secretions (9) and urine (25). The majority of these isolates were K. pneumoniae (31), followed by E. coli (13), E. cloacae (10), C. freundii (9) and P. rettgeri (1). The NDM-1 producers were distributed equally between ICU and non- ICU patients. Twenty-seven isolates were susceptible to carbapenems as per CLSI 2011 interpretation. Conclusion: NDM-1 producing Enterobacteriaceae cause a multitude of infections both in ICU and non ICU settings. Screening tests have poor sensitivity for NDM-1 producers. Interpretation based on CLSI 2011 guidelines can lead to erroneous susceptibility report.

The present report describes fatal bacteremia due to multidrug-resistant A. baumannii in a post- ERCP patient. Case Presentation: An 85-year-old woman with a history of diverticulosis, hypertension, left hip arthroplasty and gout was admitted to our hospital with a 1-week history of jaundice, lethargy, confusion. Her initial vital signs were within normal ranges. Icteric sclera were noted on physical examinations and the rest was unremarkable. Significant findings on laboratory tests were white blood cell count 13,400/$\mu$L; total bilirubin 6.2 mg/dL; AST 248U/L; ALT 185 U/L; and alkaline phosphatase 617 U/L. A CT scan of the abdomen revealed a large obstructing stone and ascending cholangitis (Figure 1). Patient was empirically started on antibiotics. Patient underwent two ERCPs to extract stones. Biliary stent was placed during the second procedure. One day after the procedure, patient developed septic shock. Antibiotics were switched to intravenous meropenem and levofloxacin. She was intubated and required maximum vasopressor supports for refractory shock. Five out of 5 sets of blood cultures and bile culture grew multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Intravenous tigecycline was added on day 10 and parenteral colistin replaced meropenem after final sensitivity reports returned. Blood cultures drawn after administration of colistin remained sterile; however, the patient could not recover from septic shock. Discussion: Bacteremia is a rare but well-documented complication following endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). According to a recent prospective, observational study following a total of 2,052 ERCPs, 46 cases of bacteremia were detected after ERCP (incidence rate of 2.24/100). The most commonly isolated pathogens were Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococci. Acinetobacter baumannii is an aerobic gram-negative rod. It is an important pathogen of nosocomial infections including sepsis and ventilator-associated pneumonia. Management of Acinetobacter baumannii infections can be challenging to clinicians because of its resistance to common antibiotics. Colistin and tigecycline have been utilized in the treatment of resistant pathogens. Considering the significant nephrotoxicity of colistin and emerging resistance to tigecycline of A. baumannii as in our case, developing newer antibiotics against multidrug-resistant A. baumannii are needed. Also, gastroenterologists should take into consideration the risk of bacteremia and sepsis caused by hospital-acquired resistant pathogens whenever performing invasive procedures such as ERCP.

We examined the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients, defined the resistance determinants and structure of the genetic element harboring the bla{\textless}inf{\textgreater}MBL{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}gene through genome sequencing, and typed MBL-producing P. aeruginosa isolates using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), repetitive sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR), and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Seven patients were affected that were hospitalized at three community hospitals, a long-term-care facility, and a tertiary care center; one of the patients died as a result of infection. Isolates belonged to sequence type 233 (ST233) and were extensively drug resistant (XDR), including resistance to all fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, and $\beta$-lactams; two isolates were nonsusceptible to colistin. The bla{\textless}inf{\textgreater}MBL{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}gene was identified as bla{\textless}inf{\textgreater}VIM-2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}contained within a class 1 integren (In559), similar to the cassette array previously detected in isolates from Norway, Russia, Taiwan, and Chicago, IL.

11688,YES,Leal2013,Article,"INTRODUCTION: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common disease in the community, and a matter of concern due to the increasing resistance of microorganisms to first line antibiotics and the emergence of multiresistant strains producing extended spectrum beta lactamases (ESBL) in the community. METHODS: An analytical case-control study was conducted over twelve months in 9 hospitals in Colombia. We collected isolates of E. coli, Klebsiella spp. and Proteus spp. from patients with community-onset UTI. The presence of ESBL, AmpC and KPC beta-lactamases were characterized by microbiological and molecular methods. The aim of this study was to determine factors related to the presence of these mechanisms of the resistance to third generation cephalosporins. RESULTS: A total of 325 isolates (287 E. coli, 29 Klebsiella spp. and 9 Proteus spp.) were included. The most frequent comorbidities among the patients were hypertension (n=82; 25.2{\%}) and diabetes mellitus (n=68; 20.9{\%}). Previous use of antimicrobials was found in 23{\%} of patients, and 29{\%} had a previous UTI. Resistance to third and fourth generation cephalosporins varied between 3.4{\%} and 6.3{\%} in E. coli and between 6.9{\%} and 17.8{\%} in K. pneumoniae.

371,YES,AlNaiemi2006,Article,"OBJECTIVES: During treatment with selective decontamination of the digestive tract (SDD), four multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains, three different Escherichia coli and one Klebsiella pneumoniae, were isolated from four patients not known as carriers of such MDR strains before their admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) in the Academic Medical Center (AMC) in Amsterdam. These isolates were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-positive. We investigated whether this was due to interspecies transfer of resistance genes. METHODS: The MDR strains were typed by amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis. The plasmids from these strains were characterized by restriction fragment length polymorphism and the resistance genes were characterized by PCR and sequence analysis. RESULTS: The strains were genetically unrelated and contained identical plasmids with ESBL genes. CONCLUSIONS: We identified an outbreak of plasmid-mediated ESBL genes during SDD treatment in the ICU. The use of third-generation cephalosporins in SDD is associated with the emergence of ESBLs. We conclude that identification of emerging MDR Gram-negative bacteria and recognition of resistance plasmid transfer during SDD treatment are crucial for optimal application of this regimen in ICUs.",N {Al Naiemi} and E R Heddema and A Bart and E {de Jonge} and C M Vandenbroucke-Grauls and P H Savelkoul and B Duim,"0305-7453 (Print)

The situation worsens due to the overuse of antimicrobials and the development of bacterial resistance, being the latter an emerging health problem in different areas of the world. Among the causative microorganisms of acute diarrheal diseases are those of Aeromonas genus, recognized as second risk emerging pathogens. OBJECTIVES: To determine the most frequently isolated Aeromonas species in fecal samples from acute diarrheal patients and their antimicrobial susceptibility. METHODS: The Bauer-Kirby's method allowed identifying the susceptibility to several antimicrobials of 100 isolated samples coming from the provincial hygiene and epidemiology centers during 2007 and 2008. RESULTS: Identification of the species was accomplished in 67{\%} of isolates, being A. caviae (33{\%}) y A. hydrophila (29{\%}) the predominant species. It was demonstrated that 100{\%} of isolates got resistant to at least one of the studied antimicrobials.

17509,YES,Revathi2013,Article,"BACKGROUND: The emergence of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) was observed in a Kenyan hospital from 2009 to 2010. Further investigation of the dissemination of CRAB isolates and the molecular characterization of associated resistance determinants were therefore performed. METHODS: Antibiotic susceptibilities were determined by broth microdilution and Etest. Metallo-beta-lactamases were detected by Etest method. Clonal relationships were studied by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). beta-Lactam and aminoglycoside resistance determinants and the clonal relatedness to widespread European clones were studied by PCR and sequencing. RESULTS: Sixteen CRAB isolates from 10 patients possessed six pulsotypes; half of the isolates belonged to the European clone II (ECII) lineage. ECII strains were typed as MLST sequence type 2 (ST2) and ST109, and non-ECII strains as ST25 and ST113. All isolates harbored ISAba1-blaOXA-23, blaOXA-51-like, blaADC, and class 1 integron, including one that also harbored blaNDM-1. ADC-57 and two integron cassettes (arr-2-cmlA5 and aadB-aadA2-cmlA6-aadA15) were newly-identified. Non-ECII isolates, designated non-ECII clone, carried armA and integron cassette arr-2-cmlA5. CONCLUSIONS: Two distinct clones of CRAB--ECII and non-ECII epidemic clones--were disseminated in Kenya. The concomitance of ISAba1-blaOXA-23 was the major mechanism contributing to CRAB.

6097,YES,Falgenhauer2016,Article,"Background: Multidrug resistant Enterobacteriaceae, especially those harbouring extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) or carbapenemases, are high risk pathogens, in particular for patients with an impaired immune system. A relevant treatment option, especially for infections involving carbapenemase-encoding Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), is the polypeptide antibiotic colistin. However, colistin resistance in bacteria can occur, but was mediated by chromosomal mutations so far. Recently, a plasmid encoded, transferable resistance gene called mcr-1 was identified in China. This study was performed to investigate the presence of mcr-1 in German ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae and CRE isolated from 2010 to 2014. Materials and Methods: Whole genome sequencing of 600 Enterobacteriaceae isolates from different sources (human, livestock, companion animal, environment, food), was performed using Illumina MiSeq. The sequencing data was deposited in a local database, which was searched for the presence of the mcr-1 gene using blastn. The genetic environment of the mcr-1 gene was investigated using ISFinder and blastn. Conjugation experiments were performed to identify the transfer rates of the mcr-1-encoding plasmids. Result: Nine Escherichia coli isolates harboured the mcr-1 gene. Four isolates, originating from swine samples, were blaCTX-M-1 positive. Four other isolates had been isolated from food and harboured either a blaCTX-M-1, blaCTX-M-14, blaCTX-M-15 or a blaTEM-52 ESBL gene. The ninth isolate originated from a human patient sample, harbouring a blaKPC-2 carbapenemase gene. Colistin resistance was transferable to a susceptible E. coli recipient strain by conjugation, confirming plasmidic location. Conjugation rates ranged from 10-1 to 10-7 cells per recipient. The genetic environment of mcr-1 was diverse, including variants with an upstream copy of the insertion sequence ISApl1, as well as variants which did not harbour any ISApl1. All isolates harboured mcr-1 on plasmids of other incompatibility groups (IncX4 or IncHI2 instead of IncI2) as described in the original publication from China (Liu et al., 2015). Conclusion: The colistin resistance gene mcr-1 is present in Germany at least since the year 2010, which was the earliest isolation time point of mcr-1 positive isolates. The presence of a human CRE isolate with the mcr-1 gene is clearly worrisome, as this represents a further reduction of treatment options on the way to a postantibiotic era. The presence of mcr-1 in a larger set of isolates (from other locations, e.g. environment) has to be tested to investigate the epidemiology of the mcr-1 gene in Germany in greater detail.",L Falgenhauer and S E Waezsada and Y Yao and K Gwozdzinski and J Schmiedel and R Bauerfeind and G B Michael and S Schwarz and Y Pfeifer and G Werner and N Roschanski and U Roesler and A Irrgang and B Guerra and A K√§sbohrer and M Kaase and L Kreienbrock and A Goesmann and C Imirzalioglu and T Chakraborty,1618-0607,International Journal of Medical Microbiology,"China,Escherichia coli,Germany,animal experiment,animal tissue,carbapenemase,colistin,conjugation,data base,endogenous compound,extended spectrum beta lactamase,gene insertion sequence,human,human versus animal comparison,livestock,nonhuman,pig,plasmid,publication,recipient,whole genome sequencing",133,{Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and carbapenemase encoding Enterobacteriaceae isolates harbouring the novel mcr-1 gene},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L614104675 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmm.2016.11.008 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=16180607{\&}id=doi:10.1016{\%}2Fj.ijmm.2016.11.008{\&}atitle=Extended-spe,306,2016,8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,YES,Brooke,YES,Zach,Zach,Mushtaq,NO,ONLY GAVE ME AUTHOR AND ABSRACT INDEX,

The presence and severity of peripheral neuropathy and peripheral arterial disease determines treatment options and ulcer outcome. Infection of diabetic foot ulcers is a commonly encountered problem and is an important cause of morbidity, prolonged hospital admission and amputations. Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) are emerging in diabetic foot infections. The clinical presentation and bacteriological profile of diabetic foot ulcers in Mulago Hospital is not known. Aims: To describe the clinical presentation of peripheral neuropathy and peripheral arterial disease, and to identify the common bacterial isolates from diabetic foot ulcers and their susceptibility patterns to commonly used antibiotics in Mulago Hospital. Methods: This was prospective study involving 60 patients with diabetic foot ulcers admitted to the endocrinology unit at Mulago Hospital between July and December 2010. Cases were recruited consecutively after provision of written consent. The socio-demographics of the patients and relevant clinical history on the diabetic foot ulcers were noted. Both feet were examined for peripheral neuropathy and peripheral arterial disease using standard clinical methods. Deep-tissue swabs from the ulcers were taken for both aerobic and anaerobic cultures and for susceptibility tests, using standard microbiological methods. Results: The majority (56.7{\%}) of the patients had neuro-ischaemic foot ulcers, followed by ischaemic and neuropathic ulcers in equal proportions (18.3{\%}) and unclassified (no features of neuropathy and ischaemia) (6.7{\%}). Gram-negative aerobes were most frequently isolated (80.6{\%}), followed by gram-positive aerobes (19.4{\%}). No anaerobe was isolated. Polymicrobial infection was 41.7{\%}, and 84{\%} of the isolates were positive for MDROs. ESBL production and MRSA were noted in 43.5 and 60{\%} of the bacterial isolates, respectively. Conclusion: Diabetic foot ulcers in this population of patients were mostly neuro-ischaemic with varying severity of neuropathy. Most ulcers occurred in the setting of normal dorsalis artery pulse and impaired/absent posterior tibial artery pulse. Infection was mostly aerobic Gram-negative with a high prevalence of MDROs.

The aim of this study was to assess the mechanism of high-level carbapenem resistance in an A. baumannii isolate imported to a Czech hospital. Methods: Strain ANC 4097, which had been imported from Egypt, was recovered from the sputum of a patient hospitalized in the Czech Republic in July 2011. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by disc diffusion while the production of metallo-{\ss}-lactamases was assessed using Etest MBL strips. Resistance genes were characterized by PCR and sequencing. The location and genetic background of blaNDM-1 were analyzed by hybridization of genomic DNA with a blaNDM-like probe and primer walking strategy. The strain was genotyped by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Results: ANC 4097 belonged to sequence type (ST) 1 which is typical of the ‚ÄúEuropean clone I‚Äù epidemic lineage. It showed high level resistance to all {\ss}-lactams and other antimicrobial agents except colistin, tobramycin, netilmicin, doxycycline and tigecycline. The positive MBL test suggested the production of a metallo-{\ss}-lactamase. The strain harboured the blaNDM-1, blaOXA-23 and intrinsic blaOXA- 51-like carbapenemase genes. Insertion sequence ISAba1 was identified upstream of the blaOXA-23 and blaOXA-51-like genes. The blaNDM- 1 gene was located onto the chromosome of ANC 4097 and inside composite transposon Tn125. Conclusions: This study reports on the first blaNDM-1 positive A. baumannii strain in the Czech Republic.

11,MAYBE,Abamecha2015,Article,"BACKGROUND: Multi-drug-resistant Enterococci colonizing the intestinal tract of hospitalized patients are the major source of infection as well as nosocomial spread. Despite worldwide increasing rate of multidrug resistant Enterococci colonization and infection among hospitalized patients, there is scarcity of data from resource limited setting. The present study aimed at determining the antimicrobial resistance profile of Enterococcus species from intestinal tracts of hospitalized patients in Jimma, Ethiopia. METHODS: The study was conducted among hospitalized patients at Jimma University Specialized Hospital, from January to July 2013. Fecal samples were collected and processed for bacterial isolation and susceptibility testing to antimicrobial agents. Stool samples were inoculated onto enterococcus selective media (Bile Esculin azide agar plate) with and without 6 microg/ml of vancomycin. The isolates were identified to genus and species level by cultural characteristics, Gram's stain, catalase test, growth in 6.5{\%} NaCl broth, growth at 45 degrees C, motility test and by using API 20 Streptococcus system. Sensitivity testing was done using Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. Minimum inhibitory concentrations for vancomycin were determined using E-test strips. RESULT: Overall, Enterococci were isolated from 114 (76{\%}) of the study subjects. The isolates were Enterococcus faecium (35.1{\%}) followed by Enterococcus faecalis (29.8{\%}), Enterococcus gallinarum (17.5{\%}), Enterococcus casseliflavus (8.8{\%}) and Enterococcus durans (8.8{\%}). Among 114 tested Enterococci isolates, 41 (36{\%}) were resistant to ampicillin, 62 (54.4{\%}) to streptomycin and 39 (34.2{\%}) to gentamycin. Other alternative antibiotics to treat mixed nosocomial infection caused by Enterococci also showed high rate of resistance in vitro: ciprofloxacin (50{\%} of resistance), norfloxacin (49.1{\%}), erythromycin (63.2{\%}), tetracycline (64.9{\%}), chloramphenicol (34.2{\%}), and nitrofrantoin (32.4{\%}). Multiple drug resistance was observed among 89.5{\%} of E. faecium and E. faecalis. Vancomycin resistant Enterococci were observed in 5{\%} of E. faecium isolates. CONCLUSION: This study reveals high rate of fecal colonization by multidrug-resistant Enterococci and prevalence of vancomycin resistance strains. Thus periodic surveillance of antibacterial susceptibilities is recommended to detect emerging resistance and to prevent the spread of antibacterial-resistant strains.",A Abamecha and B Wondafrash and A Abdissa,1756-0500,BMC Res Notes,"*Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial,*Hospitalization,Adolescent,Adult,Aged,Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use,Cross-Sectional Studies,Enterococcus faecalis/drug effects/isolation {\&} pur,Enterococcus faecium/drug effects/isolation {\&} puri,Enterococcus/*drug effects/isolation {\&} purificatio,Ethiopia,Feces/microbiology,Female,Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections/*drug therapy/*,Hospitals, University,Humans,Intestines/*microbiology,Male,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Middle Aged,Predictive Value of Tests,Vancomycin Resistance,Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci/drug effects/isol,Young Adult",213,"{Antimicrobial resistance profile of Enterococcus species isolated from intestinal tracts of hospitalized patients in Jimma, Ethiopia}",NA,8,2015,NA,"1756-0500

12659,MAYBE,Lulitanond2013,Article,"Objectives: Since reports of community-associatedMRSA are limited at Thailand, we aimed at characterizing MRSA isolates from outpatients by both phenotypic and genotypicmethods and comparedwith the isolates from inpatients to know whether specific MRSA clones disseminated in the Thai community. Methods: Strains: 14 MRSA isolates (O-1 through O-14) from outpatients at Srinagarind Hospital, Khon Kaen University, Thailand, collected between September 2005 and March 2006; 5 MRSA strains (I-1 through I-5) isolated from inpatients {\textgreater}72 hours after admission; Two MRSA strains from a nasal swab of a nurse (N-1) and from a pig with pneumonia (P-1). Antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined using the agar dilution method. Molecular typing: Coagulase types, agr types, spa types, SCCmec types were determined as described by previously. Carriages of genes for heavy metal resistance (mer and copA) and exfoliative toxin a, b, d (eta, etb, etd), PVL (lukS-PV, lukF-PV) and TSST (tsst-1)were examined by PCR. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of SmaI-digested chromosomal DNA was performed using a contour-clamped homogeneous electric field mapper system. Nucleotide sequences in and aroundthe SCCmec elementand coa gene were determined using the DNA fragments amplified with PCRs and long-range PCRs. Results: All MRSA isolates from the outpatients and inpatients were multidrug-resistant (resistant to‚â•3 classes of antimicrobials). Among the 14 isolates fromthe outpatients, the O-2 strain (JCSC6690) carried type IX SCCmec and belonged to the agr II, coagulase XIc, spa type t337 and ST9. The other 13 isolates from the outpatients and 4 inpatients carried the type III SCCmec, belonging to agr I, coagulase IV, spa typet037 (except for one that was t233) and ST239. Nucleotide sequence determination revealed that the type IX SCCmec element in the O-2 strain was distinct from the type IX SCCmec, as previously identified in the ST398 strain (JCSC6943), since the identities of the ccrA and ccrB genes were 93 and 91{\%}, respectively, and that many open reading frames (ORFs) at the joining regions (the regions other than the mec and ccr gene complexes) were not homologous.

6306,YES,Fernandez-Natal2016,Article,"Human infections associated with Corynebacterium kroppenstedtii are rarely reported, and this organism is usually described as antibiotic sensitive. Almost all published cases of C. kroppenstedtii infections have been associated with breast pathology in women and have been described in New Zealand, France, Canada, India and Japan. Here we describe the microbiologic characteristics of two strains isolated from two women diagnosed of granulomatous mastitis in Spain. One C. kroppenstedtii isolate was antibiotic sensitive while the other was multidrug resistant. Biochemical identification was possible using a wide battery of methods including API Coryne V2.0, API Strep, API NH, API NE, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and 16S rRNA gene amplification and sequencing. Antimicrobial susceptibility to 28 antibiotics as determined by Etest showed one isolate being sensitive to benzylpenicillin, ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin, gentamicin, vancomycin, clindamycin, tetracycline, linezolid and rifampin. The second isolate showed resistance to ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin, clindamycin, tetracycline and rifampin. The multidrug-resistant isolate contained the erm(X), tet(W), cmx, aphA1-IAB, strAB and sul1 resistance genes known from the R plasmid pJA144188 of Corynebacterium resistens.

METHODS: Forty-nine human isolates of MAC were tested for susceptibility to nine chemotherapeutic agents. All isolates were from Indian patients suffering from chronic pulmonary mycobacteriosis. Drug susceptibility was performed both by agar dilution and MIC method. MIC values were analysed, both visually and by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader. RESULTS: More than 40{\%} of the MAC isolates were sensitive to ciprofloxacine (48.98{\%}), amikacin (46.94{\%}) and roxithromycin (42.86{\%}) by the MIC method. In contrast, the isolates showed high degree of resistance to the first line antituberculosis drugs: only 28.6{\%} were sensitive to rifampicine, 22.85{\%} to isoniazid and ethambutol each and 36.7{\%} were sensitive to streptomycin. In addition, 22.85{\%} of the strains were sensitive to clofazimine and 34.7{\%} to kanamycin.

We report on a 61 year-old woman with history of previous successful treatments of MRSA bacteremia with vancomycin. She was later hospitalized for catheter-related MRSA bacteremia that persisted despite vancomycin treatment. The vancomycin minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was initially 1-2 microg/ml, suggesting susceptibility, but changed to 4 microg/ml. At this level, the organism was classified as a vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (VISA). Therapy was changed from vancomycin to daptomycin, and the patient's blood cultures were sterilized. High suspicion of VISA should be raised in MRSA-infected patients who fail or have a history of vancomycin therapy so that additional susceptibility testing and appropriate antibiotic therapy can be promptly commenced to reduce the morbidity associated with VISA infection.",S Chaiwongkarjohn and P Pramyothin and N Suwantarat and M J Bankowski and T Koyamatsu and S E Seifried and E F Bello,"0017-8594 (Print)

Up to the present, there were two reports of clinical VISA cases in Korea. We now report two additional cases of VISA with the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4 microg/mL. The first patient was a 59 yr-old man who had undergone total hip replacement arthroplasty in 1999 due to avascular necrosis of femur heads. He had recurrent episodes of infected hip caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and was treated with vancomycin. He underwent replacement operation of prosthesis. Cultures of joint fluid and joint tissue grew S. aureus. Vancomycin MIC as determined by a broth microdilution method was 4 microg/mL for the both isolates. The patient was treated with high enough doses of vancomycin to maintain serum trough concentrations at 20-25 microg/mL for 52 days and was discharged. The second patient was a 57 yr-old man with diabetes. He lost consciousness from drinking. After recovery of consciousness, he was diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia. MRSA and Acinetobacter baumannii were cultured from sputum and the patient was treated with vancomycin and meropenem. During hospitalization, bed sores developed in his ankle and back. A wound culture from the sore grew S. aureus with vancomycin MIC of 4 microg/mL.

This study aimed to investigate the Mdm2 gene, clarithromycin resistance, and possible risk factors for Helicobacter pylori infection. Methods. Risk factors and clinical characteristics were analyzed, including patient demographic data, patient income, personal history, possible source of transmission, patient symptoms, endoscopic findings, patterns of clarithromycin resistance, and patterns of Mdm2 SNIP309. Results. Ingestion of pickled fish (OR = 11.27, 95{\%} CI = 4.31-29.45, p{\textless}0.0001), salt crab (OR = 8.83, 95{\%} CI = 1.99-39.14, p{\textless}0.001), and Papaya salad (OR = 8.73, 95{\%} CI = 4.54-16.79, p{\textless}0.01).

For empirical coverage of CA-MRSA in outpatients with skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) is recommended oral antibiotics including clindamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), a tetracycline (doxycycline or minocycline) and linezolid. However, susceptibility to these antibiotics is variable in different geographic regions, especially for clindamycin and macrolides. The aim of this study was to describe the incidence of CA-MRSA and level of non betalactam resistance in outpatients with SSTIs in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Methods: Prospective and observational study of CA-MRSA SSTIs in outpatients attended at the Infectious Diseases Department, Cosme Argerich Hospital (March 2010-October 2011). Susceptibility tests were performed by disk diffusion and Vitek 2 system (bioM{\'{e}}rieux) according to the CLSI. For clindamycin susceptibility the D-Test method was also performed. A phenotypic rule was applied and CAMRSA was defined as strains resistant to {\textless}3 of the following non- betalactams antibiotics: gentamicin, erythromycin, tetracycline, TMPSMX, rifampin and ciprofloxacin. Only one sample per patient was included. Results: Of a total of 99 isolates of S. aureus, 79{\%} (IC95 70-86) corresponded to CA-MRSA. Male sex: 63{\%}. The median age was 31 years (IQR 27-53). HIV-infected patients: 8{\%} (IC95{\%} 3-16). Clinical presentation included: cutaneous abscesses 44{\%}, furuncules 35{\%} and cellulitis 21{\%}.

Typhi, to understand the related epidemiological characteristics of typhoid fever and to provide evidence for the development of strategies, in Guangxi. METHODS: Data of typhoid fever from surveillance and reporting system between 1994 to 2013 was collected and statistically analyzed epidemiologically. The susceptibility of 475 S. Typhi isolates from patients on ten antibiotics was tested by broth micro-dilution method and minimum inhibition concentration was obtained and interpreted based on the CLSI standard. RESULTS: From 1994 to 2013, a total of 57 928 cases of typhoid fever were reported in Guangxi province with an annual incidence of 6.29/100 000 and mortality as 0.03{\%}. The higher incidence was observed in the population under 20 years of age. There was no significant difference on incidence between male and female, but farmers and students were among the hardest hit groups. More cases were seen from the northern part of the province. Cases appeared all year round with the peak from May to October. A total of 13 major outbreaks during 2001 to 2013 were reported and the main transmission route was water-borne. All the strains were sensitive to third generation cephalosporins cefotaxime and fluoroquinolones norfloxacin. The susceptibility rates to tetracycline, chloramphenicol, ampicillin and gentamicin was around 98{\%} but relative lower susceptible rate to ciprofloxacin was seen as 89.89{\%} . The lowest susceptibility was found for streptomycin and sulfamethoxazole agents, with the rates as 67.73{\%} and 65.89{\%} , respectively. One strain was found to have been resistant to ciprofloxacin and another 47 isolates with reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin. Twenty eight isolates were found to be resistant to multiple antibiotics and one displayed ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole tetracycline and nalidixic acid (ACSSxT-NAL) resistance profile. This was the first report in China. Multi-drug resistant strains were frequently isolated from small scale outbreaks of typhoid fever. CONCLUSION: The incidence of typhoid fever in Guangxi was still high and some strains showed multi-drug resistance and reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, indicating that the surveillance and monitor programs on drug resistance of S. Typhi should be strengthened, to prevent large scale outbreaks of typhoid fever in this province.",M Wang and B Kan and J Yang and M Lin and M Yan and J Zeng and Y Quan and H Liao and L Zhou and Z Jiang and D Huang,"0254-6450 (Print)

19122,MAYBE,Shibuya2012,Article,"Backgrounds and Aims Since the late 1990s, community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) has emerged worldwide as a life-threatening pathogen that is primarily associated with soft-tissue infection of the skin in otherwise healthy children, adolescents, and athletes. It is also associated with severe systemic infections such as sepsis and necrotizing pneumonia. We analyzed the clinical pathology and infection control of CA-MRSA respiratory tract infection in a Japanese emergency hospital. Methods We screened CA-MRSA strains, isolated from the clinical laboratory of Tokyo Metropolitan Hiroo General Hospital between April 2007 and December 2010, based on the following conditions: strains confirmed as Staphylococcus aureus with minimal inhibitory concentration values for oxacillin, clindamycin, and levofloxacin of ‚â•4, ‚â§0.5 and ‚â§2 $\mu$g/mL, respectively. All screened strains were confirmed by identification of Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) and type IV SCCmec genes by PCR. We analyzed the clinical pathology of all CA-MRSA strains isolated from patient respiratory tract specimens. Results We confirmed 53 new CA-MRSA strains between April 2007 and December 2010; these accounted for 3.6{\%} of the total MRSA strains isolated during this period. Respiratory specimens were the source of 30 (56{\%}) strains, whereas skin and soft tissue specimens were the source of 12 (23{\%}) strains. The screened CA-MRSA strains were sensitive to anti-MRSA agents, cephems and quinolone. Of the 30 strains isolated from respiratory specimens, 22 strains (73.3{\%}) were considered as colonizers, and eight strains (26.7{\%}) were considered as causative microorganisms of respiratory tract infection. One strain of PVL-positive CA-MRSA was isolated from respiratory tract specimens during the study period. Conclusions A total of 0.5{\%} of all MRSA isolated at our hospital between April 2007 and December 2010 was CA-MRSA considered as causative microorganisms of respiratory tract infection. This ratio is smaller than that reported in the USA. The isolated CA-MRSA strains were sensitive to antimicrobial agents. Nevertheless, since CA-MRSA is associated with severe systemic infections such as sepsis and necrotizing pneumonia, factors affecting the incidence of CA-MRSA infection should be investigated.",Y Shibuya and S Okamoto and H Hiramoto and H Ohta and R Usui and T Enomoto,1073-449X,American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,"American,Japan,Japanese (people),Panton Valentine leukocidin,Staphylococcus aureus,adolescent,antiinfective agent,athlete,cephem derivative,child,clindamycin,clinical laboratory,community,gene,general hospital,hospital,human,infection,infection control,levofloxacin,methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus,methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus infect,microorganism,minimum inhibitory concentration,oxacillin,pathogenesis,pathology,patient,pneumonia,quinolone,respiratory system,respiratory tract infection,sepsis,skin,society,soft tissue,soft tissue infection",NA,{Clinical pathology and infection control of community-acquired methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus respiratory tract infection in a Japanese emergency hospital},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L71986316 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=1073449X{\&}id=doi:{\&}atitle=Clinical+pathology+and+infection+control+of+community-acquired+methicillin-resistant+s,185,2012,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,MAYBE,Brooke,NO,Zach,Allison,Mushtaq,NO,NO ACCESS,

9060,MAYBE,Huang2013e,Article,"The genetic features of the antimicrobial resistance of a multidrug resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae strain harboring bla NDM-1 were investigated to increase our understanding of the evolution of NDM-1. The strain, KPX, came from a Taiwanese patient with a hospitalization history in New Delhi. Complete DNA sequencing was performed; and the genes responsible for antimicrobial resistance were systematically examined and isolated by library screening. KPX harbored two resistance plasmids, pKPX-1 and pKPX-2, which are 250-kb and 141-kb in size, respectively, with bla NDM-1 present on pKPX-1. The plasmid pKPX-1 contained genes associated with the IncR and IncF groups, while pKPX-2 belonged to the IncF family. Each plasmid carried multiple antimicrobial resistance genetic determinants. The gene responsible for resistance to carbapenems was found on pKPX-1 and that for resistance to aztreonam was found on pKPX-2. To our surprise, we discovered that bla NDM-1 exists on pKPX-1 as multiple copies in the form of tandem repeats. Amplification of bla NDM-1 was found to occur by duplication of an 8.6-kb unit, with the copy number of the repeat varying from colony to colony. This repeat sequence is identical to that of the pNDM-MAR except for two base substitutions. The copy number of bla NDM-1 of colonies under different conditions was assessed by Southern blotting and quantitative PCR. The bla NDM-1 sequence was maintained in the presence of the antimicrobial selection; however, removal of antimicrobial selection led to the emergence of susceptible bacterial populations with a reduced copy number or even the complete loss of the bla NDM-1 sequence. The dynamic nature of the NDM-1 sequence provides a strong argument for judicious use of the broad-spectrum antimicrobials in order to reduce the development and spread of antimicrobial resistance among pathogens.",T W Huang and T L Chen and Y T Chen and T L Lauderdale and T L Liao and Y T Lee and C P Chen and Y M Liu and A C Lin and Y H Chang and K M Wu and R Kirby and J F Lai and M C Tan and L K Siu and C M Chang and C P Fung and S F Tsai,1932-6203,PLoS ONE,",*DNA Copy Number Variations,Adult,Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology,Asian,Bacterial/chemistry/*genetics,Bacterial/drug effects/,Carbapenems/pharmacology,Colony Count,DNA,DNA sequence,Drug Resistance,Humans,India,Klebsiella Infections/drug therapy/microbiology,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Klebsiella pneumoniae/drug effects/enzymology/*gen,Male,Microbial,Multiple,Plasmids/*chemistry,Sequence Analysis,Tandem Repeat Sequences,adult,amikacin,ampicillin,antibiotic resistance,article,aztreonam,bacterial gene,bacterial strain,bacterium isolate,beta-Lactamases/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism,blaNDM 1 gene,carbapenem derivative,cefazolin,cefepime,cefotaxime,cefoxitin,ceftazidime,ceftriaxone,cefuroxime,chloramphenicol,ciprofloxacin,colistin,doripenem,ertapenem,gene amplification,gene dosage,gene duplication,gene library,gene loss,gentamicin,hospitalization,human,imipenem,levofloxacin,male,meropenem,metallo beta lactamase,minocycline,molecular dynamics,multidrug resistance,nalidixic acid,nonhuman,nucleic acid base substitution,piperacillin,plasmid,protein NDM 1,sultamicillin,tandem repeat,tetracycline,tigecycline,timentin,unclassified drug,unindexed drug",e62774,{Copy Number Change of the NDM-1 sequence in a multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolate},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L368833129 http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0062774 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=19326203{\&}id=doi:10.1371{\%}2Fjournal.pone.0062774{\&}atitle=Copy+Num,8,2013,4,"From Duplicate 2 (Copy Number Change of the NDM-1 sequence in a multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolate - Huang, T W; Chen, T L; Chen, Y T; Lauderdale, T L; Liao, T L; Lee, Y T; Chen, C P; Liu, Y M; Lin, A C; Chang, Y H; Wu, K M; Kirby, R; Lai, J F; Tan, M C; Siu, L K; Chang, C M; Fung, C P; Tsai, S F)

16186,MAYBE,Paul2014b,Article,"Severe skin lesions caused by Staphylococcus aureus infection are associated with production from bacterial cells of Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL), a typical virulence factor of community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA), as well as other toxins represented by exfoliative toxins. Through a retrospective study of 26 S. aureus strains isolated from skin lesions of diabetic patients admitted to a hospital in Bangladesh, 2 PVL-gene-positive MRSA-IVa strains and 8 PVL-negative, exfoliative toxin D (ETD) gene (etd)-positive MRSA-IVa strains were isolated. A PVL-positive MRSA-IVa strain had a type I arginine catabolic mobile element (ACME), belonged to ST8/agr-type I/spa-type t121 (a variant of t008), and harbored blaZ, tet(K), msrA, and aph(3')-IIIa, which are mostly typical characteristics found in USA300, a predominant CA-MRSA clone in the United States. Another PVL-positive MRSA strain, belonging to ST1929 (CC88)/agr-type III/spa-type t3341, was negative for ACME, but possessed blaZ and tet(K). The etd-positive MRSA-IVa strains possessed the epidermal cell differentiation inhibitor B (EDIN-B)-encoding gene (edinB) and belonged to ST1931 (CC80)/agr-type III/spa-type t11023 (a variant of t044), which was genetic trait similar to that of the European CA-MRSA ST80 clone. However, unlike the European ST80 strains, the etd-positive MRSA strains detected in the present study harbored seb, sek, and seq, while they were negative for tet(K), aph(3')-IIIa, and fusB, showing susceptibility to fusidic acid. These findings suggested that etd-positive ST1931 MRSA strains belong to the same lineage as the European ST80 MRSA clone, evolving from a common ancestral clone via acquisition of a different pathogenicity island. This is the first report of a USA300-like MRSA-IV strain, PVL-positive ST1929 (CC88) MRSA-IV, and European ST80 CA-MRSA-like etd-positive ST1931 (CC80) MRSA-IV strains isolated in Bangladesh.",S K Paul and S Ghosh and M Kawaguchiya and N Urushibara and M A Hossain and S Ahmed and C Mahmud and M S A Jilani and J A Haq and A A Ahmed and N Kobayashi,"1931-8448

19875,YES,Starnino2009,Article,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to characterize 22 azithromycin-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates, collected in Italy from January 2007 through June 2008, during a study of the prevalence of antibiotic resistance. METHODS: MICs of azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, penicillin and tetracycline were determined by the Etest method. Azithromycin-resistant strains (MIC {\textgreater} or = 1 mg/L) were genetically analysed by N. gonorrhoeae multi-antigen sequence typing (NG-MAST) and PFGE. RESULTS: A total of 22 azithromycin-resistant isolates were found among the 219 collected. Five of the 22 isolates showed high-level azithromycin resistance (MICs of 128 or 256 mg/L). Sixteen of the 22 were isolated from men who have sex with men. Among the 14 sequence types (STs) found by NG-MAST, 5 STs, containing clusters of two, three or four strains, were homogeneous with respect to epidemiology and/or antibiotic susceptibility. PFGE divided the 22 strains into two main groups that were possibly related. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of gonococci with high-level resistance to azithromycin circulating in Italy. Correlation between NG-MAST results and epidemiological data for some of the analysed strains and patients could be established. This study represents a reference point for future surveillance in Italy and suggests the need to add azithromycin to the antibiotic susceptibility panel for gonococci.",S Starnino and P Stefanelli,0305-7453,J Antimicrob Chemother,"*Drug Resistance, Bacterial,Adult,Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology,Azithromycin/*pharmacology,Bacterial Typing Techniques,Cluster Analysis,DNA Fingerprinting,DNA, Bacterial/genetics,Female,Genotype,Gonorrhea/*microbiology,Humans,Italy,Male,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Middle Aged,Molecular Epidemiology,Neisseria gonorrhoeae/classification/*drug effects,Sequence Analysis, DNA,Young Adult,purification",1200--1204,{Azithromycin-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains recently isolated in Italy},NA,63,2009,6,"1460-2091

Botulism was confirmed by identification of botulinum toxin and Clostridium botulinum in stools. A C. botulinum A2 strain resistant to penicillins and with heterogeneous resistance to metronidazole was isolated from stool samples up to 110 days after onset. Antibiotic susceptibility was tested by disc agar diffusion and MICs were determined by Etest. Whole genome sequencing allowed detection of a gene cluster composed of blaCBP for a novel penicillinase, blaI for a regulator, and blaR1 for a membrane-bound penicillin receptor in the chromosome of the C. botulinum isolate. The purified recombinant penicillinase was assayed. Resistance to beta-lactams was in agreement with the kinetic parameters of the enzyme. In addition, the beta-lactamase gene cluster was found in three C. botulinum genomes in databanks and in two of 62 genomes of our collection, all the strains belonging to group I C. botulinum.

AIM : Study of clinical profile of carbapenemase producing nosocomial septicemia. Materials {\&}Methods: Clinical profile of patients admitted to our multi-speciality teritiary care referral hospital with the ‚Äú new bug septicaemia‚Äù were studied and reported as an emerging dreaded problem. A total of 3 cases were admitted in succession in one month period with male:female ratio 2:1, average age 52 years, and average hospital stay of 21 days. Two cases were referred from other hospitals with catheter in-situ, while one direct admission. All the three cases had fever without localised infection at presentation, with background problems of Post-ATG hypoplastic anemia in one, Lupus (multiorgan involvement,Acute Stroke in one. All the three were documented to have radiological evidence of nosocomial pneumonia involving right lung (2 cases had VAP).

It is extremely important to be aware of the local prevalence of antibiotic resistance so as to adjust treatment strategies. During this single-centre, prospective study, we aimed to determine primary and secondary resistance rates of H. pylori to antibiotics as well as host and bacterial factors associated with this problem. Overall, 180 patients (131 female; mean age 43.4+/-13.5 years; primary resistance 103; secondary resistance 77) with positive (13) C-urea breath test were submitted to upper endoscopy with gastric biopsies. Helicobacter pylori was cultured and antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by Etest and molecular methods. Clinical and microbiological characteristics associated with resistance were evaluated by logistic regression analysis. Among the 180 isolates 50{\%} were resistant to clarithromycin (primary 21.4{\%}; secondary 88.3{\%}), 34.4{\%} to metronidazole (primary 29.1{\%}; secondary 41.6{\%}), 33.9{\%} to levofloxacin (primary 26.2{\%}; secondary 44.2{\%}), 0.6{\%} to tetracycline and 0.6{\%} to amoxicillin. Being female was an independent predictor of resistance to clarithromycin and metronidazole. Previous, failed, eradication treatments were also associated with a decrease in susceptibility to clarithromycin. History of frequent infections, first-degree relatives with gastric carcinoma and low education levels determined increased resistance to levofloxacin. Mutations in the 23S rRNA and gyrA genes were frequently found in isolates with resistance to clarithromycin and levofloxacin, respectively.

Objectives: To investigate the epidemiology of Kp-KPC+ isolates in a secondary general hospital in Greece, with no prior history of Kp-KPC+ until 2010. Methods: Between 2011 and 2014,156 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were recorded from routine laboratory tests. Carbapenemases production was tested by Modified Hodge Test. Phenylboronic acid, EDTA or both along with meropenem discs were used as inhibitors for detection of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases (KPCs), metallo-beta lactamases (MBLs) or both carbapenemases, respectively. Susceptibility testing for various antimicrobial agents including carbapenems was performed by the disk diffusion method according to CLSI criteria. MICs were determined by Vitek- 2 or E-test methodology. BlaKPC, blaVIM and blaNDM genes were detected by PCR. Clinical data, related to admission, previous hospitalizations and outcome, were collected using patients' medical records. Results: During the study period, 18 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were found as KPC-2 producers (11,5{\%}). No other carbapenemase gene was detected in our hospital during the study period. The majority of Kp-KPC (+) isolates were recovered from urine cultures. All isolates were highly resistant to carbapenems, whereas susceptibility rates for colistin, tigecyclin and gentamicin were 100{\%}, 92{\%} and 77{\%}, respectively. The first KPC-2 positive isolate was detected in September 2011. The yearly distribution of these patients was: 2011(3), 2012 (7), 2013 (4), 2014 (4). 10 patients had a history of previous hospitalization in tertiary care hospitals in Athens. Crude mortality rate among patients with Kp-KPC(+) was high (6/18, 33,3{\%}). Colonization/infection during hospitalization was not identified.

The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of these resistance phenotypes among clinical isolates of Escherichia coli (EC), Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) and Klebsiella oxytoca (KO) collected from USA subjects during the 2010 Assessing Worldwide Antimicrobial Resistance Evaluation (AWARE) Surveillance program. Methods: Clinical isolates (1 per patient) of EC (n = 657), KP (n = 653) and KO (n = 250) were collected from 65 medical centres geographically distributed across the USA. Specimen infection sources included; blood (53.6{\%}), skin (SSSI; 10.0{\%}{\%}), respiratory (RTI; 11.4{\%}) and urine (UTI; 22.3{\%}). All isolates were centrally tested for susceptibility to various antimicrobials by CLSI broth microdilution methods (M100-S21). ESBL phenotypes included isolates with MICs ‚â• 2 mg/L for ceftriaxone, ceftazidime or aztreonam. Carbapenem-resistant isolates included those with MICs ‚â• 2 mg/L for meropenem. Resistant phenotypes were evaluated among different specimen sources and by geography using the nine USA census regions. Results: ESBL phenotypes were present for {\textgreater}12{\%} of all collected EC, KP and KO from all specimen sources. ESBL phenotypes ranged from 10.6{\%} for KP to 16.6{\%} for EC from SSSI, from 10.4{\%} for KP to 31.4{\%} for EC among RTI isolates, and from 4.7{\%} for KO to 7.3{\%} for EC for UTI isolates. ESBL phenotypes of EC and Klebsiella spp. were most prevalent in the East South Central region of the USA at 22{\%} and 23{\%}, respectively and least prevalent in the Pacific region (8.3{\%} and 6.7{\%}, respectively). ESBL phenotypes were greater than two-fold higher among nosocomial organisms (18.5{\%}) when compared with community-acquired organisms (8.1{\%}). ESBL phenotypes were often resistant to fluoroquinolones (‚â•70{\%}). Carbapenem resistance was detected among 27 (4.1{\%}) isolates of KP with the highest prevalence rates being observed in the Mid-Atlantic (13.8{\%}) and West South Central regions (8.0{\%}).

Imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates cultured from clinical specimens during 2008-2009 were analysed phenotypically and molecularly by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with sequencing. Genotyping was performed by multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat (VNTR) analysis (MLVA). Clinical information was obtained by electronic chart review for all patients infected or colonised with an imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa isolate that was included in the study. In total, 106 imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates were included. The bla(VIM-2) gene was detected in 35/106 isolates (33{\%}) and was associated with integrons. Compared with non-MBL-producing imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa, VIM-2 MBL-producing isolates showed higher rates of multidrug resistance. Patients with VIM-2 MBL-producing isolates were more likely to be admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and had a higher risk of invasive infection, including development of bacteraemia. MLVA identified two separate VIM-2 MBL-producing clones, responsible for outbreaks in the ICU but also affecting 10 other departments. This is the first reported outbreak of VIM-2 MBL-producing P. aeruginosa in The Netherlands.

Materials and Methods: The microorganism was isolated from blood culture of a patient with endocarditis. Identification to the species level was performed by the Vitek 2 System and was verified by a molecular method based on fbl gene. Susceptibility testing to various antimicrobial agents was assessed by the Vitek 2 system, while the MICs values were determined by Etest. The production of penicillinase was performed by the nitrocephin disk test, while the presence of mecA gene was detected by PCR. In order to detect mutations in PBP1 and PBP4 genes, amplification followed by sequencing analysis was done and the results were compared with those obtained from a clinical S. lugdunensis strain susceptible to oxacillin (MIC: 0.75 mg/L). Results: The isolate, despite the high-level resistance to oxacillin (MIC: 256 mg/L), did not carry the mecA gene, while no overproduction of penicillinase or mutation of PBP4 were detected. However some mutations were found in PBP1: an alteration in the 482 position (L482P) and an insertion in 570 position of four aminoacids (SAYG). These mutations were not found in the susceptible strain. As $\beta$-lactams bind to the penicillin-binding motif KTG in the transpeptidase region, that is located in 582 position, alterations in or around the motif possibly confer resistance due to reduced affinity to $\beta$-lactams.

22005,MAYBE,Wada2016,Article,"Objectives: We analyzed bacterial strains isolated from urine samples of patients with urinary tract infections (UTI) at Okayama University Hospital over a 30-year period to characterize trends in species and antimicrobial susceptibilities. Methods: Clinical isolates were collected from in- and out-patients with pyuria and bacteriuria who were treated between 1984 and 2014 (one episode per patient and plural isolates were counted in polymicrobial infection). We examined these isolates to identify pathogens and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility. Results: Isolates from complicated UTI over a 30-year period revealed Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) was the most frequently isolated in the first decade (1984-1994), MRSA in the second decade (1995-2004), and Escherichia coli (E. coli) in the latest decade (2005-2014). In uncomplicated UTI examined over 20 years, E. coli was the most frequently isolated species accounting for 47-94{\%} of isolates. Fluoroquinolone (FQs)-insusceptible E. coli were first isolated in 1994 and increased to about 35{\%} in 2013 in patients with complicated UTI. Conclusions: Complicated UTI involving P. aeruginosa and MRSA decreased over the last 10 years. Our data suggest that several factors such as shorter hospitalizations, shorter indwelling catheter use, and appropriate antimicrobial use has decreased colonization of P. aeruginosa and MRSA with relative increases in isolation of E. coli including FQs-insusceptible strains.We must continue our surveillance of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria isolated from urine samples and evaluate antibiograms, since their persistence in the urinary tract would be problematic.",K Wada and S Uehara and M Yamamoto and T Sadahira and R Mitsuhata and M Araki and Y Kobayashi and A Ishii and R Kariyama and T Watanabe and Y Nasu and H Kumon,"1437-7780

METHODS: P. mirabilis 18306 was isolated in March 2006 from a patient in Palestine with diabetic foot infection. Antibiotic susceptibility tests and various molecular techniques, including PCR, cloning and DNA sequencing were used for detection and characterization of SGI1 in P. mirabilis 18306. RESULTS: P. mirabilis 18306 showed the typical multidrug resistance phenotype of SGI1 as it was resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulphonamides and tetracycline, in addition to trimethoprim and nalidixic acid. Molecular characterization showed that P. mirabilis 18306 harboured a structure similar to SGI1, except that the aadA2 gene, which confers resistance to streptomycin and spectinomycin, of standard SGI1 had been replaced with dfrA15, which confers resistance to trimethoprim. Furthermore, the nucleotide sequence of the extrachromosomal circular form of SGI1 in P. mirabilis was found to be identical to that of Salmonella Typhimurium DT104. However, PCR results showed that P. mirabilis 18306 was negative for the left and right junctions which represent the integration sites of SGI1 into Salmonella enterica chromosome. Hence, this new variant of SGI1 may be integrated at a different site into the chromosome of P. mirabilis 18306. Tn1826-derived class 2 integron, which carries only two gene cassettes, sat2 and aadA1, was also identified in this strain. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we identified a new variant SGI1 containing the multiple resistance genomic region in a multidrug-resistant strain of P. mirabilis.

We describe a biphasic VRE outbreak and identify risk factors for VRE acquisition. METHODS: After the occurrence of 2 cases of VRE infections in a 44-bed NICU, a bundle of interventions was implemented that included active surveillance cultures for VRE, enhanced infection control measures, and audits on antimicrobial use, from June to December 2008. Analysis was performed using polymerase chain reaction and pulse-field gel electrophoresis techniques. A case-control study was conducted to identify risk factors. RESULTS: Among 253 neonates screened, 101 (39.9{\%}) were found to be colonized with VRE. During the first 9 weeks of the study period, 59 new cases were detected. Molecular analysis showed 1 predominant clone. During weeks 10-12, no new cases of VRE colonization were detected; however, at week 13, just when the outbreak appeared to be over, a second wave occurred, with 42 new cases and multiple clones detected. Multivariate analysis identified administration of antimicrobial therapy for late-onset neonatal sepsis and hospitalization during the first month of this outbreak as significant risk factors for VRE colonization. CONCLUSION: Both a high prevalence of VRE colonization and antimicrobial use promoted the transmission of VRE during this biphasic outbreak.

Recently, Malaysia has been alarmed by the occurrence of Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates carrying NDM-1 and KPC genes, which also known as high-consequence antibiotic resistance threats. Here, we described the in-vitro activity of broad-spectrum antibiotics and the mechanism of resistant used by Carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae strains of different genotype. Methods: The strains used in the study were previously isolated from patients admitted to Universiti Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC). The strains were genotyped using PFGE and Carbapenemase production was confirmed via modified Hodge Test. Susceptibility of the strains to Aminoglycosides, Carbapenems, Cephalosporins, Penicilin, Quinolone, Tetracycline, and Polypeptides were determined using Kirby Bauer method and the Minimum inhibitory concentrations of each antibiotic were confirmed using E-test. The presences of carbapenemase hydrolyzing genes as well as the genes encoding ESBL were determined. Results: A total of 17 Carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae were subtyped into 9 pulsotypes. The prevalence of OXA48 among the strains was high (71{\%}). The OXA48 eproducing strains were subtyped into 5 different pulsotypes where 8 strains shared similar pulsotype. There were 8 KPC-, 2 IMPand 1 NDM- positive strains detected. However, the presence of these carbapenemase hydrolyzing genes was weakly correlated to the genotypes of the strains. All the strains showed high resistance to the antibiotics tested except for Tigecycline and Colistin.

12407,YES,LoboValbuena2013,Article,"Introduction. Linezolid (LNZ) is a useful therapy for infections due to multidrug resistant Gram positive bacteria. Outbreaks of LNZ-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (LRCNS) have been reported in ICU patients worldwide. Although LNZ resistance among CNS is extremely rare, it seems to be an emerging problem. OBJECTIVES. To analyze the epidemiologic and clinical features of an outbreak of LRCNS in a 22-bed ICU. METHODS. Observational study of ICU patients with infection or colonization by LRCNS in a 600-bed teaching hospital (2010-2012). Demographic data, comorbidities, APACHE II antibiotic exposure, invasive procedures, site of infection or colonization, ICU LOS, and mortality were recorded. Susceptibility study was performed by broth microdilution and E-test. The presence of cfr gen was studied by PCR. LNZ ICU utilization data (2009-2012) was obtained from the Hospital Pharmacy. Defined daily dose (DDD) of LNZ was 1,200 mg. RESULTS. We detected 42 isolates in 42 patients. The isolates were identified as S. epidermidis (36 cases) and S. hominis (6), and were recovered from blood (33 cases) urine (6), catheter (2) and peritoneal fluid (1); most of them were not associated with clinical infection. All isolates were resistant to LNZ (MIC[4 mg/L) but were found to be susceptible to vancomycin, teicoplanin, and daptomycin. Molecular study showed cfrmediated LNZ resistance in 45 {\%} of the tested isolates. Most patients were male (81 {\%}), the mean age was 61 years. The main diagnosis at ICU admission was respiratory failure (43 {\%}), stroke (17 {\%}), trauma (12 {\%}) and shock (12 {\%}), 33 {\%} of them were immunodepressed. Mean APACHE II score 22.5 and mean ICU LOS 43 days. 41 had central venous and urinary catheter, and most of them received mechanical ventilation (38), parenteral nutrition (12) or renal replacement therapy (8); 20 patients required surgery or other invasive procedures. The mean ICU LOS before LRSCN isolation was 34 days, and a high proportion of patients had received antimicrobials in the previous month: Lnz in 37 (mean duration 11.8 days), carbapenems in 21, and other beta-lactam in 16. LRCNS was associated with clinical infection in only 5 patients (12 {\%}): catheter-related bacteremia (2), urinary infection (2), and primary bacteremia (1) treated successfully with alternative antimicrobials. Overall ICU mortality was 29 {\%}. Mean LNZ DDD/100 patient-days was 13.4 with no statistical difference from 2009 to 2012. CONCLUSIONS. LRSCN have emerged in Spain in critically ill patients with common risk factors for nosocomial infection such as invasive procedures and antibiotic exposure. Most isolates represent colonization, being less frequent the appearance of clinical infection. All isolates remained susceptible to alternative antimicrobials such as glycopeptides and daptomycin.

To characterize all the Staphylococcus aureus isolates by phage typing; and the MRSA isolates by biotyping and typing by antibiogram, in addition. Materials and methods: A total of 56 cases of DNSIs from a 1600- bedded tertiary care teaching hospital of New delhi were recruited. Aspirated pus from the patients were cultured and the Staphylococcus aureus isolates were identified by conventional techniques. The antimicrobial susceptibility against a wide range of antimicrobial agents was performed by the disc diffusion method employing the modified Stokes' technique. The MICs of vancomycin, teicoplanin, amikacin, ciprofloxacin, mupirocin, fusidic acid were determined by the E test. Screening for methicillin resistance was performed both by cefoxitin disc method as well as oxacillin agar screening method. All the isolates were subjected to bacteriophage typing by the 23 conventional (basic) set of phages (Blair et al). All the MRSA isolates were further subjected to biotyping (Coia et al.) and a novel typing method using the antibiogram. Observations: Staphylococcus aureus was isolated in 46.4{\%} of cases (n = 56). Of the 26 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus obtained, 3(11.5{\%}) were identified as MRSA. Penicillin resistance was found to be 100{\%} among S. aureus isolates. Cotrimoxazole resistance was seen in 100{\%} of MRSA and 69.6{\%} of methicillin Sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) isolates, while ciprofloxacin resistance in 66.6{\%} and 56.8{\%} respectively. However, all the S. aureus isolates were uniformly sensitive to vancomycin and teicoplanin at MIC90 value of 2 $\mu$g/mL for both. An overall phage typeablilty of 53.9{\%} was observed for the isolates with maximum in the mixed group of phages (39.1{\%}). Biotyping of MRSA isolates showed that all the three MRSA isolates belonged to biotype A.

Severe MRSA infections have been associated with the virulence factor Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL). The aim of this study was to investigate susceptibility patterns, the presence of toxin genes, including that encoding PVL, and clonality among MRSA isolates collected from patients in Greece over a 12-year period. MRSA isolates were collected from January 2001 to December 2012 from six different hospitals. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined with the disk diffusion method and the Etest. The presence of the toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 gene (tst), the enterotoxin gene cluster (egc) and the PVL gene was tested with PCR. The genotypic characteristics of the strains were analysed by SCCmec and agr typing, and clonality was determined with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing. An increasing rate of MRSA among S. aureus infections was detected up to 2008. The majority of PVL-positive MRSA isolates belonged to a single clone, sequence type (ST)80-IV, which was disseminated both in the community and in hospitals, especially during the warmest months of the year. Carriage of tst was associated with ST30-IV, whereas egc was distributed in different clones. CA-MRSA isolates were recovered mainly from skin and soft tissue infections, whereas HA-MRSA isolates were associated with surgical and wound infections. During the period 2001-2012, ST80-IV predominated in the community and infiltrated the hospital settings in Greece, successfully replacing other PVL-positive clones. The predominance of ST239-III in HA-MRSA infections was constant, whereas new clones have also emerged.

251,MAYBE,Ahmad2016b,Article,"BACKGROUND: Fluoroquinolones are the backbone of multidrug resistant tuberculosis treatment regimens. Despite the high burden of multidrug resistant tuberculosis in the country, little is known about drug resistance patterns, prevalence, and predictors of fluoroquinolones resistance among multidrug resistant tuberculosis patients from Pakistan. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate drug resistance patterns, prevalence, and predictors of fluoroquinolones resistance in multidrug resistant tuberculosis patients. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted at a programmatic management unit of drug resistant tuberculosis, Lady Reading Hospital Peshawar, Pakistan. Two hundred and forty-three newly diagnosed multidrug resistant tuberculosis patients consecutively enrolled for treatment at study site from January 1, 2012 to July 28, 2013 were included in the study. A standardized data collection form was used to collect patients' socio-demographic, microbiological, and clinical data. SPSS 16 was used for data analysis. RESULTS: High degree of drug resistance (median 5 drugs, range 2-8) was observed. High proportion of patients was resistant to all five first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs (62.6{\%}), and more than half were resistant to second line drugs (55.1{\%}). The majority of the patients were ofloxacin resistant (52.7{\%}). Upon multivariate analysis previous tuberculosis treatment at private (OR=1.953, p=0.034) and public private mix (OR=2.824, p=0.046) sectors were predictors of ofloxacin resistance. CONCLUSION: The high degree of drug resistance observed, particularly to fluoroquinolones, is alarming. We recommend the adoption of more restrictive policies to control non-prescription sale of fluoroquinolones, its rational use by physicians, and training doctors in both private and public-private mix sectors to prevent further increase in fluoroquinolones resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains.",N Ahmad and A Javaid and S A Sulaiman and L C Ming and I Ahmad and A H Khan,1413-8670,Braz J Infect Dis,"Adolescent,Adult,Antitubercular Agents/*pharmacology,Child,Cross-Sectional Studies,Female,Fluoroquinolones,Fluoroquinolones/*pharmacology,Humans,Male,Mdr-tb,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Middle Aged,Mycobacterium tuberculosis/*drug effects,Pakistan,Prevalence,Private,Resistance,Tuberculosis, Multidrug-Resistant/*microbiology,Young Adult",41--47,"{Resistance patterns, prevalence, and predictors of fluoroquinolones resistance in multidrug resistant tuberculosis patients}",NA,20,2016,1,"1678-4391

7762,MAYBE,Grobner2009,Article,"The spread of Gram-negative bacteria with plasmid-borne extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) has become a worldwide problem. This study analysed a total of 366 ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae strains isolated from non-selected patient specimens at the university hospital of Tubingen in the period January 2003 to December 2007. Although the overall ESBL rate was comparatively low (1.6 {\%}), the percentages of ESBL-producing Enterobacter spp. and Escherichia coli increased from 0.8 and 0.5 {\%}, respectively, in 2003 to 4.6 and 3.8 {\%} in 2007. In particular, the emergence was observed of one carbapenem-resistant ESBL-producing E. coli isolate and five carbapenem-non-susceptible ESBL-positive Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, in two of which carbapenem resistance development was documented in vivo under a meropenem-containing antibiotic regime. The possible underlying mechanism for this carbapenem resistance in three of the K. pneumoniae isolates was loss of the Klebsiella porin channel protein OmpK36 as shown by PCR analysis. The remaining two K. pneumoniae isolates exhibited increased expression of a tripartite AcrAB-TolC efflux pump as demonstrated by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry analysis of bacterial outer-membrane extracts, which, in addition to other unknown mechanisms, may contribute towards increasing the carbapenem MIC values further. Carbapenem-non-susceptible ESBL isolates may pose a new problem in the future due to possible outbreak situations and limited antibiotic treatment options. Therefore, a systematic exploration of intestinal colonization with ESBL isolates should be reconsidered, at least for haemato-oncological departments from where four of the five carbapenem-non-susceptible ESBL isolates originated.",S Grobner and D Linke and W Schutz and C Fladerer and J Madlung and I B Autenrieth and W Witte and Y Pfeifer,"0022-2615 (Print)

We analysed all 692 isolates of Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhi from cases in England, Scotland and Wales that were sent to the Laboratory of Enteric Pathogens at the Health Protection Agency, Centre for Infections, London, UK between 2000 and 2003. The country of acquisition was known for 416 isolates (60{\%}), and the majority of these (70{\%}) came from India or Pakistan. Overall, 24 countries were listed, mainly in Asia and Africa. A total of 48 phage types were detected, 41{\%} of which were Vi-phage type E1. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed that 22{\%} of isolates were multidrug resistant (MDR) (defined as resistance to chloramphenicol, ampicillin and co-trimoxazole) and 39{\%} were quinolone resistant. A significant number of isolates (n=49) were sensitive to nalidixic acid by disk test but exhibited low-level ciprofloxacin resistance, suggesting a novel mechanism of resistance and reinforcing the need for minimum inhibitory concentration determination. Overall, 13{\%} of isolates were both MDR and likely to show a poor response to a fluoroquinolone. A third-generation cephalosporin (e.g. ceftriaxone) should be considered as empirical therapy in regions of the Indian subcontinent where resistance is now at high levels as well as in patients returning from these areas.

In the present study, 198 E. coli isolates from patients with UTIs in Shanghai in 2008 were examined by susceptibility testing, with an extremely high number (153/198) showing multidrug resistance (MDR). And, the expression of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) reached 48.5{\%} (96/198). The resistance rates to penicillins, fluoroquinolone, folate pathway inhibitors and first- and second-generation cephalosporins were high. Molecular analyses showed that the CTX-M-9 group (70/96) was the most common CTX-M group among UPEC, followed by the CTX-M-1 group (27/96). Phylogenetic group D accounted for 42.4{\%} (84/198) of the isolates, exhibiting the highest ESBLs (50/84) and MDR (75/84) rates. Virulence genes were present in a significantly high proportion in the phylogenetic group B2 isolates, except for the afaBC gene. The ESBL-producing strains analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) were clustered into six groups at a cutoff of 67{\%}. Notably, the findings that afaBC was specific to phylogenetic group D and PFGE group I and was correlated with the CTX-M-9 group were different from a previous report.

Typhi circulating during the study was highly clonal, with 91{\%} of isolates belonging to a single clonal complex of the S. Typhi H58 haplogroup. The patterns of disease were consistent with the presence of an endemic haplotype H58-C and a localised outbreak of S. Typhi haplotype H58-E2 in 2004. H58-E2-associated typhoid fever cases exhibited evidence of significant geo-spatial clustering along the Song H u branch of the Mekong River. Multidrug resistance was common in the established clone H58-C but not in the outbreak clone H58-E2, however all H58 S. Typhi were nalidixic acid resistant and carried a Ser83Phe amino acid substitution in the gyrA gene. SIGNIFICANCE: the H58 haplogroup dominates S. Typhi populations in other endemic areas, but the population described here was more homogeneous than previously examined populations, and the dominant clonal complex (H58-C, -E1, -E2) observed in this study has not been detected outside Vietnam. IncHI1 plasmid-bearing S. Typhi H58-C was endemic during the study period whilst H58-E2, which rarely carried the plasmid, was only transient, suggesting a selective advantage for the plasmid. These data add insight into the outbreak dynamics and local molecular epidemiology of S. Typhi in southern Vietnam.",K E Holt and C Dolecek and T T Chau and P T Duy and T T La and N V Hoang and T V Nga and J I Campbell and B H Manh and N V {Vinh Chau} and T T Hien and J Farrar and G Dougan and S Baker,1935-2727,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,"*Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial,Adult,Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic us,Child,Child, Preschool,DNA, Bacterial/chemistry/genetics,Female,Genotype,Haplotypes,High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing,Humans,Infant,Male,Plasmids,Salmonella typhi/classification/*drug effects/*gen,Typhoid Fever/drug therapy/*epidemiology/*microbio,Vietnam/epidemiology",e929,{Temporal fluctuation of multidrug resistant salmonella typhi haplotypes in the mekong river delta region of Vietnam},NA,5,2011,1,"1935-2735

The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence of TEM- and SHV-type ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae strains in Zahedan, Southeast Iran. METHODS: A total of 170 non-repetitive K. pneumoniae strains were collected from patients referred to three teaching hospitals of Zahedan. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was determined for 17 antibiotics using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. The frequency of ESBL-producing strains was calculated, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of ESBL-producing strains were determined for cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and cefpodoxime. The presence of bla TEM and bla SHV genes was tested in all ESBL-producing strains using polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Among the 170 K. pneumoniae clinical isolates, 55 (32.4{\%}) were ESBL producers; 92.7{\%} (n=51) and 72.7{\%} (n=40) of the isolates carried the bla SHV and bla TEM genes, respectively, and 67.3{\%} (n=37) carried both genes. The sequencing results showed that all bla TEM types were bla TEM-1, except for two isolates that were bla TEM-104. The bla SHV types were bla SHV-1, bla SHV-11, bla SHV-12, bla SHV-99, bla SHV-108, and bla SHV-110. CONCLUSIONS: The percentage of bla TEM and bla SHV among ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae isolates from Zahedan is relatively high, indicating the need for further surveillance and consideration in antibiotic use. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of TEM-104-, SHV-99-, SHV-108-, and SHV-110-type ESBLs among clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae from Iran, and TEM-1, SHV-1, SHV-11, and SHV-12 appear to be the dominant ESBLs in this region.",S Shahraki-Zahedani and S Rigi and M Bokaeian and A Ansari-Moghaddam and M Moghadampour,0037-8682,Rev Soc Bras Med Trop,"Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology,Bacterial Proteins/*genetics,DNA, Bacterial/*genetics,Disk Diffusion Antimicrobial Tests,Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial/genetics,Genes, Bacterial,Genotype,Humans,Iran,Klebsiella Infections/microbiology,Klebsiella pneumoniae/*drug effects/*genetics,Phenotype,Sequence Analysis, DNA,beta-Lactamases/*biosynthesis",441--445,"{First report of TEM-104-, SHV-99-, SHV-108-, and SHV-110-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae from Iran}",NA,49,2016,4,"1678-9849

18587,MAYBE,SchimithBier2010,Article,"BACKGROUND: In the last few years, carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii isolates (CR-AB) have been identified worldwide. The first description of OXA-23-producing A baumannii in Brazil was from the city of Curitiba in 2003. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the persistence and dissemination of the first OXA-23-producing A baumannii clone isolated from patients in Hospital de Clinicas, Curitiba, Brazil. METHODS: An antimicrobial susceptibility profile of the isolates was determined by the standard agar dilution method. Molecular detection of beta-lactamase genes was done by polymerase chain reaction. The clonal relationship of the isolates was analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Epidemiologic and clinical features were evaluated as well. RESULTS: Genotypic analysis of 172 CR-AB isolates by PFGE identified 3 distinct major PFGE clusters (A, B, and C, accounting for 36, 69, and 65 isolates, respectively). All isolates carried the bla(OXA-23)-like gene and were multidrug-resistant, but were susceptible to tigecycline and polymixin B. The mortality rate related to CR-AB infection was 45.4{\%}, and ventilator-associated pneumonia and bloodstream infections were the most frequent clinical manifestations. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of 3 clones among the CR-AB isolates suggests that cross-transmission was the main mechanism responsible for dissemination of OXA-23 producers. PFGE pattern A was genotypically similar to that of the first OXA-23-producing A baumannii clone identified in Curitiba in 1999. This clone persisted in the same hospital until April 2004. The presence of the bla(OXA-)23-like gene was the main mechanism associated with carbapenem resistance among the isolates studied.",K E {Schimith Bier} and S O Luiz and M C Scheffer and A C Gales and M C Paganini and A J Nascimento and E Carignano and L M {Dalla Costa},0196-6553,Am J Infect Control,"*Bacterial Typing Techniques,*beta-Lactam Resistance,Acinetobacter Infections/*epidemiology/microbiolog,Acinetobacter baumannii/classification/*drug effec,Adolescent,Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology,Bacterial Proteins/genetics,Brazil/epidemiology,Carbapenems/*pharmacology,Child,Child, Preschool,DNA Fingerprinting,DNA, Bacterial/genetics,Female,Gene Transfer, Horizontal,Humans,Infant,Male,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Middle Aged,Molecular Epidemiology,Polymerase Chain Reaction,Young Adult,beta-Lactamases/genetics,purification",308--314,"{Temporal evolution of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii in Curitiba, southern Brazil}",NA,38,2010,4,"1527-3296

2595,YES,Brennan2014,Article,"Background. Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) are clinically challenging, threaten patient safety, and represent an emerging public health issue. CRE reporting is not mandated in Michigan. Methods. The Michigan Department of Community Health-led CRE Surveillance and Prevention Initiative enrolled 21 facilities (17 acute care and 4 long-term acute care facilities) across the state. Baseline data collection began September 1, 2012, and ended February 28, 2013 (duration, 6 months). Enrolled facilities voluntarily reported cases of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli according to the surveillance algorithm. Patient demographic characteristics, laboratory testing, microbiology, clinical, and antimicrobial information were captured via standardized data collection forms. Facilities reported admissions and patient-days each month. Results. One-hundred two cases over 957,220 patient-days were reported, resulting in a crude incidence rate of 1.07 cases per 10,000 patient-days. Eighty-nine case patients had test results positive for K. pneumoniae, whereas 13 had results positive for E. coli. CRE case patients had a mean age of 63 years, and 51{\%} were male. Urine cultures (61{\%}) were the most frequently reported specimen source. Thirtyfive percent of cases were hospital onset; sixty-five percent were community onset (CO), although 75{\%} of CO case patients reported healthcare exposure within the previous 90 days. Cardiovascular disease, renal failure, and diabetes mellitus were the most frequently reported comorbid conditions. Common ris k factors included surgery within the previous 90 days, recent infection or colonization with a multidrug-resistant organism, and recent exposures to antimicrobials, especially third- or fourth-generation cephalosporins. Conclusions. CRE are found throughout Michigan healthcare facilities. Implementing a regional, coordinated surveillance and prevention initiative may prevent CRE from becoming hyperendemic in Michigan. {\textcopyright} 2014 by The Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America.

We assessed the frequency and diversity of CTX-M enzymes among 97 ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates as well as to establish the genetic relationship among CTX-M producers collected from six hospitals in Caracas. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays identified the blaCTX-M genes in 42 isolates (43.3{\%}). The blaCTX-M-1 group was the most common in Escherichia coli (91 {\%}) and the blaCTX-M-2 in Klebsiella pneumoniae (56.6{\%}). Presence of blaCTX-M-1, blaCTX-M-2, blaCTX-M-15, and blaCTX-M-14 was revealed by sequencing analysis. The CTX-M producers were mainly isolated from urine samples (46{\%}). Antimicrobial susceptibility tests showed that a high proportion of CTX-M-producing isolates was resistant to ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Analysis of enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus PCR and repetitive extragenic palindromic PCR profiles revealed several genetic clusters between isolates carrying the blaCTX-M-1 group, while complete genotypic diversity among isolates carrying the blaCTX-M-2 group was observed. This study documented that CTX-M has achieved a citywide distribution, with the CTX-M-1 group as the most frequent (66.7{\%}). The CTX-M clusters detected suggest that patient-patient transmission may have played an important role in the widespread and high prevalence of the CTX-M-1 group.

9811,MAYBE,Jolivet2016,Article,"Background Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus raffinosus has rarely been associated with nosocomial infection and outbreaks. Aim To report the successful control of a nosocomial outbreak of vanA-type vancomycin-resistant E.¬†raffinosus in a surgical intensive care unit. Methods The investigation of the outbreak is reported with control measures taken. Molecular typing of vancomycin-resistant E.¬†raffinosus isolates was performed by repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Findings Between September and October 2014, vancomycin-resistant E.¬†raffinosus isolates were isolated from four patients. The index patient had been hospitalized previously in Portugal, and was not found to be colonized by vancomycin-resistant enterococci on screening cultures obtained at admission. However, vancomycin-resistant E.¬†raffinosus was isolated from a bile sample 19 days after hospital admission. All four isolates were resistant to both vancomycin and teicoplanin due to the presence of the vanA gene, while remaining susceptible to daptomycin and linezolid. Repetitive sequence-based PCR confirmed the spread of a single vanA-positive E.¬†raffinosus clone. Infection control measures including direct PCR screening on rectal specimens, contact precautions, and cohorting of patients and personnel led to successful control of the outbreak. Conclusion This is the first reported outbreak of vanA-type vancomycin-resistant E.¬†raffinosus in France in both clinical and screening specimens among hospitalized patients. The inability of routine selective screening media to detect the vancomycin-resistant E.¬†raffinosus in the index case likely contributed to the outbreak.",S Jolivet and M Fines-Guyon and B Nebbad and J C Merle and D {Le Pluart} and C Brun-Buisson and J W Decousser and V Cattoir,"1532-2939

12503,MAYBE,Lopes2013a,Article,"INTRODUCTION: Acinetobacter baumannii is opportunistic in debilitated hospitalised patients. Because information from some South American countries was previously lacking, this study examined the emergence of multi-resistant A. baumannii in three hospitals in Cochabamba, Bolivia, from 2008 to 2009. METHODOLOGY: Multiplex PCR was used to identify the main resistance genes in 15 multi-resistant A. baumannii isolates. RT-PCR was used to measure gene expression. The genetic environment of these genes was also analysed by PCR amplification and sequencing. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined for key antibiotics and some were determined in the presence of an efflux pump inhibitor, 1-(1-napthylmethyl) piperazine. RESULTS: Fourteen strains were found to be multi-resistant. Each strain was found to have the blaOXA-58 gene with the ISAba3-like element upstream, responsible for over-expression of the latter and subsequent carbapenem resistance. Similarly, ISAba1, upstream of the blaADC gene caused over-expression of the latter and cephalosporin resistance; mutations in the gyrA(Ser83 to Leu) and parC (Ser-80 to Phe) genes were commensurate with fluoroquinolone resistance. In addition, the adeA, adeB efflux genes were over-expressed. All 15 isolates were positive for at least two aminoglycoside resistance genes. CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the first reports analyzing the multi-drug resistance profile of A. baumannii strains isolated in Bolivia and shows that the over-expression of theblaOXA-58, blaADC and efflux genes together with aminoglycoside modifying enzymes and mutations in DNA topoisomerases are responsible for the multi-resistance of the bacteria and the subsequent difficulty in treating infections caused by them.",B S Lopes and L Gallego and S G Amyes,1972-2680,J Infect Dev Ctries,"*Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial,*Genes, Bacterial,Acinetobacter Infections/microbiology,Acinetobacter baumannii/drug effects/enzymology/*g,Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology,Bacterial Outer Membrane Proteins/genetics,Bacterial Proteins/genetics,Bolivia,DNA Gyrase/genetics,Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial,Humans,Membrane Transport Proteins/genetics,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Mutation,Piperazines/pharmacology,Porins/genetics,beta-Lactamases/genetics,purification",323--328,{Multi-drug resistance profiles and the genetic features of Acinetobacter baumannii isolates from Bolivia},NA,7,2013,4,"1972-2680

Microbiological and epidemiological data from 2009 to 2011were extracted from the laboratory information system and electronic medical records. One hundred and eleven unique patient episodes consisting of 116 anaerobic isolates were selected for clinical review and antibiotic susceptibility testing. Susceptibilities to amoxicillin-clavulanate, clindamycin, imipenem, metronidazole, moxifloxacin, penicillin and piperacillin-tazobactam were performed using Etest strips with categorical interpretations according to current CLSI breakpoints. Metronidazole-resistant and carbapenem-resistant anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli were screened for the nim and cfiA genes. Clinical data was obtained retrospectively from electronic medical records. During the 3 year period, Bacteroides fragilis group (41{\%}), Clostridium species (14{\%}), Propionibacterium species (9{\%}) and Fusobacterium species (6{\%}) were the most commonly isolated anaerobes. Patients with anaerobic bacteraemia that were included in the study were predominantly above 60 years of age, with community-acquired infections. The most commonly used empiric antibiotic therapies were beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations (44{\%}) and metronidazole (10{\%}). The crude mortality was 25{\%}, and appropriate initial antibiotic therapy was not significantly associated with improved survival. Intra-abdominal infections (39{\%}) and soft-tissue infections (33{\%}) accounted for nearly three-quarters of all bacteraemia. Antibiotics with the best anaerobic activity were imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, amoxicillin-clavulanate and metronidazole, with in-vitro susceptibility rates of 95{\%}, 95{\%}, 94{\%} and 92{\%} respectively. Susceptibilities to penicillin (31{\%}), clindamycin (60{\%}) and moxifloxacin (84{\%}) were more variable. Two multidrug-resistant isolates of Bacteroides species were positive for nim and cfiA genes respectively, while another two imipenem-resistant Fusobacterium species were negative for cfiA genes. This study demonstrated that anaerobic bacteraemia in our patient population was predominantly associated with intra-abdominal and soft-tissue infections. Overall antibiotic resistance was high for penicillin and clindamycin, and the presence of emerging resistance to carbapenems and metronidazole warrants further monitoring.",T Y Tan and L S Y Ng and L L Kwang and S Rao and L C Eng,"1095-8274

2020,MAYBE,Beutlich2013,Article,"Drug-resistant derivatives of serovar-specific virulence plasmids, such as pSLT, in clinically-relevant Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strains, represent a threat for human health. We have analysed 14 S. Typhimurium isolates recovered in Italy and the United Kingdom from swine and from cases of human infection for the presence of virulence-resistance (VR) plasmids. They were negative for the multidrug resistance (MDR) region of the Salmonella genomic island 1 (SGI1), but expressed resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin/spectinomycin, sulfamethoxazole, and tetracyclines. The isolates were characterised by XbaI pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, multilocus sequence typing, and detection of resistance and virulence determinants (PCR/sequencing). Identification of VR plasmids was accomplished by PCR detection of bla genes (encoding ampicillin resistance), class 1 integrons and the pSLT virulence gene spvC. Plasmid analyses were performed by alkaline lysis, S1-nuclease digestion, replicon typing, conjugation, restriction analyses, and Southern blot/hybridization. Two blaOXA-1 positive isolates contained pSLT-derived plasmids related to pUO-StVR2. In nine isolates, eight from swine and one from a patient, MDR-conferring-IncFII-VR plasmids were detected. They contained the blaTEM-1 gene as well as a nonconventional class 1 integron with dfrA12-aadA2 gene cassettes in its variable region, and a sul3 gene in the 3' conserved segment. Restriction analysis suggested a novel pSLT variant. The results obtained underline the role of swine as a potential reservoir for the blaTEM-1-IncFII-plasmids.

Low MIC(90) values were found for metronidazole (0.5 mg/L), vancomycin (1.0 mg/L), teicoplanin (0.125 mg/L), fusidic acid (1.0 mg/L), linezolid (2.0 mg/L), daptomycin (2.0 mg/L) and tigecycline (0.064 mg/L). Three isolates (0.5{\%}) had elevated MICs for vancomycin (4-8 mg/L); however, these isolates originated from the same patient, who was receiving long-term intravenous vancomycin treatment. High-level clindamycin resistant isolates (MIC {\textgreater}256 mg/L) peaked in 1997 with 39 of 95 (41{\%}) and out of these, 36{\%} were also highly resistant to erythromycin. beta-Lactams such as penicillin V and piperacillin displayed MIC(90)s of 8 and 32 mg/L, respectively, whereas MICs of cefuroxime were {\textgreater}256 mg/L for all isolates. Universal resistance to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin was found, and resistance to moxifloxacin increased from 4{\%} of isolates in 2004 to 23{\%} in 2007. Notably, these moxifloxacin-resistant isolates did not belong to the recent epidemic PCR ribotype 027, but to the pre-existing epidemic type 012 (82{\%}), and these isolates accounted for the majority of isolates that were resistant to clindamycin (70{\%}), tetracycline (84{\%}) and rifampicin (92{\%}) as well.

We characterized the 47 isolates of a strain cluster of ST4378, a genotype that differs in the porB sequence by only one nucleotide from ST1407, in Taiwan during April 2006 to June 2012. METHODS: We identified 47 ST4378 isolates among our 2357 total isolates from the Gonococci-National Isolate Collection for Epidemiology. The corresponding patients' medical records were collected. The 47 isolates were further typed by multilocus sequence typing. Genes involved in beta-lactam (ponA), quinolone (gyrA and parC) and multidrug (mtrR, porB1b and pilQ) resistance were sequenced. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the disc diffusion test and Etest. RESULTS: Cefixime MICs for the 47 isolates ranged from 0.016 to 0.19 mg/L and ceftriaxone MICs ranged from 0.012 to 0.094 mg/L. Forty-six of the 47 isolates had a mosaic penA allele type XXXIV and one had a new allele type XL, which appeared to be a recombinant of mosaic penA type XXXIV and non-mosaic penA type II. All of the isolates harboured nearly identical polymorphism in the ponA, gyrA, parC, mtrR, porB1b and pilQ genes. Among the 33 patients with known medical records, 25 (76{\%}) were men who have sex with men (MSM), 3 (9{\%}) were bisexual and 5 (15{\%}) were heterosexual. Fourteen (42{\%}) of the 33 patients had HIV, 8 (24{\%}) had syphilis and 7 (21{\%}) had both infections. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of a cluster of ST1407-related strains in Taiwan. ST4378 is a genotype that may develop to cause third-generation cephalosporin treatment failures. Our results showed that ST4378 strains primarily transmitted in a high-risk MSM/bisexual network.

19147,MAYBE,Shimono2013,Article,"Introduction: Klebsiella pneumoniae is a type of Gram-negative bacteria belonging to Enterobacteriaceae, which can cause severe necrotizing pneumonia, urinary tract infections, biliary tract infections, and bloodstream infections (BSIs). K. pneumoniae infection occurs not only in community but also in hospital or health care environments. Some strains of K. pneumoniae have become resistant to various kinds of antibiotics, including cephalosporins and carbapenems. Besides the number of Extended-spectrum-betalactamase (ESBL) producing strains are increasing, carbapenemase such as Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) or New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM-1) producing strains have become a threat for the treatment in several countries. Objectives: The purpose of this study is to grasp and analyze the current situation of K. pneumoniae bloodstreaminfections in a single hospital in Japan. Methods: Our hospital is a university hospital having 1,200 beds, receiving patients with emergency, patients with solid tumor, hematological malignancies, and so on. From January 2008 through December 2012, a total number of 107 strains of K. pneumoniae were isolated from blood cultures. We studied on the background of these patients retrospectively; risk factors, possible source of infection, presence of central venous catheters, possible place of infection (community or hospital acquired), prognosis, antimicrobial susceptibility, and so on. Results: Eighty percent of these patients were hospital acquired. They had malignancies as underlying diseases, especially hematological malignancies (29.9{\%}). BSIs recurred in 6.5{\%} with intervals between 31 and 153 days. ESBL producing strains were isolated in 12 cases (11.2 {\%}) and only 1 strainwas resistant against carbapenems. Conclusion: BSIs caused by K. pneumoniae occurred mainly as nosocomial infections especially in immunocompromised patients. Fortunately highly resistant strains have not been isolated in our hospital, however we should pay more careful attention on the trend of K. pneumoniae infection.",N Shimono and R Nishida and M Kadowaki and M Kiyosuke and M Murata and T Yamada and S Yasunaga and T Gondo and K Toyoda and T Hoshina and J Hayashi,0924-8579,International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents,"Asia,Enterobacteriaceae,Gram negative bacterium,Japan,Klebsiella pneumoniae,antibiotic agent,antibiotic sensitivity,biliary tract infection,blood culture,bloodstream infection,carbapenem derivative,carbapenemase,central venous catheter,cephalosporin derivative,chemotherapy,community,diseases,emergency patient,environment,extended spectrum beta lactamase,health care,hematologic malignancy,hospital,hospital infection,human,immunocompromised patient,infection,metallo beta lactamase,microbiology,patient,pneumonia,prognosis,retrospective study,risk factor,solid tumor,university hospital,urinary tract infection",S146--S147,{A retrospective study of bloodstream infections caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae in a university hospital in Japan},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L71103018 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0924-8579(13)70573-9 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=09248579{\&}id=doi:10.1016{\%}2FS0924-8579{\%}2813{\%}2970573-9{\&}atitle=A+r,42,2013,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,YES,Allison,NO,Brooke,Mushtaq,Mushtaq,YES,,

12601,MAYBE,Lu2015,Article,"The preferred drugs for the treatment of syphilis, benzathine and procaine penicillin, have not been available in Shanghai for many years, and currently, the incidence of syphilis is increasing. Alternative antibiotics for patients with syphilis during the benzathine and procaine penicillin shortage include macrolides. The failure of macrolide treatment in syphilis patients has been reported in Shanghai, but the reason for this treatment failure remains unclear. We used polymerase chain reaction technology to detect a 23S rRNA A2058G mutation in Treponema pallidum in 109 specimens from syphilis patients. The use of azithromycin/erythromycin in the syphilis patients and the physicians' prescription habits were also assessed based on two questionnaires regarding the use of macrolides. A total of 104 specimens (95.4{\%}) were positive for the A2058G mutation in both copies of the 23S rRNA gene, indicating macrolide resistance. A questionnaire provided to 122 dermatologists showed that during the penicillin shortage, they prescribed erythromycin and azithromycin for 8.24¬±13.95{\%} and 3.21¬±6.37{\%} of their patients, respectively, and in the case of penicillin allergy, erythromycin and azithromycin were prescribed 15.24¬±22.89{\%} and 7.23¬±16.60{\%} of the time, respectively. A second questionnaire provided to the syphilis patients showed that 150 (33.7{\%}), 106 (23.8{\%}) and 34 (7.6{\%}) individuals had used azithromycin, erythromycin or both, respectively, although the majority did not use the drugs for syphilis treatment. Our findings suggest that macrolide resistance in Treponema pallidum is widespread in Shanghai.

53,YES,Abebe2012,Article,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of drug resistant tuberculosis (TB) in Ethiopia in general, and Jimma area in particular, is not well documented. We conducted a study at Jimma University specialized hospital in southwest Ethiopia among new cases of smear positive TB patients to determine the pattern of resistance to first-line drugs. METHODS: A health institution based cross sectional study was conducted from November 2010 to September 2011. Any newly diagnosed smear positive TB patient 18 years and above was included in the study. Demographic and related data were collected by trained personnel using a pretested structured questionnaire. Mycobacterial drug susceptibility testing (DST) to the first line drugs isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RIF), ethambutol (EMB) and streptomycin (STM) was performed on cultures using the indirect proportion method. M. tuberculosis complex (MTBC) was identified with the Capilia TB-Neo test. RESULTS: 136 patients were enrolled in the study. Resistance to at least one drug was identified in 18.4{\%}. The highest prevalence of resistance to any drug was identified against INH (13.2{\%}) followed by STM (8.1{\%}). There was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of any resistance by sex, age, HIV status and history of being imprisoned. The highest mono resistance was observed against INH (7.4{\%}). Mono resistance to streptomycin was associated with HIV infection (crude OR 15.63, 95{\%}CI: 1.31, 187). Multidrug-resistance TB (MDR-TB) was observed in two patients (1.5{\%}). CONCLUSION: Resistance to at least one drug was 18.4{\%} (INH-13.2{\%} and STM-8.1{\%}). STM resistance was associated with HIV positivity. There was relatively low prevalence of MDR-TB yet INH resistance was common around Jimma. The capacity of laboratories for TB culture and DST should be strengthened, in order to correctly manage TB patients and avoid amplification of drug resistance.",G Abebe and K Abdissa and A Abdissa and L Apers and M Agonafir and B C De-Jong and R Colebunders,1756-0500,BMC Res Notes,"*Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial,Adolescent,Adult,Antitubercular Agents/*therapeutic use,Coinfection,Cross-Sectional Studies,Ethambutol/therapeutic use,Ethiopia/epidemiology,Female,HIV Infections/epidemiology,Humans,Isoniazid/therapeutic use,Logistic Models,Male,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Middle Aged,Mycobacterium tuberculosis/drug effects/isolation,Odds Ratio,Prevalence,Rifampin/therapeutic use,Risk Assessment,Risk Factors,Sputum/microbiology,Streptomycin/therapeutic use,Tuberculosis, Multidrug-Resistant/*diagnosis/*drug,Tuberculosis, Pulmonary/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/e,Young Adult",225,{Relatively low primary drug resistant tuberculosis in southwestern Ethiopia},NA,5,2012,NA,"1756-0500

Methods We investigated cases of azithromycin-resistant gonorrhoea detected at Public Health - Seattle and King County STD Clinic between January 2014 and February 2015. In 2012- 2013, zero of 237 MSM urethral isolates were azithromycinresistant. The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) do not define an azithromycin-resistance breakpoint. CDC uses ‚â•2 mcg/mL as an 'Alert Value' minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) (here called resistant). We used agar dilution to determine MICs. Results Of 179 urethral, 83 pharyngeal and 87 rectal isolates from MSM, 11 (6.1{\%}), 6 (7.2{\%}) and 5 (5.7{\%}) had azithromycin MIC ‚â•2 mcg/mL, respectively. We identified no cases of azithromycin- resistance among 56 heterosexuals. Overall, 19 (6.9{\%}) of 276 MSM with culture-positive gonorrhoea had an azithromycin- resistant isolate. The median azithromycin MIC was 4.0 mcg/mL (range 2 to {\textgreater}256 mcg/mL). Eight patients- isolates also demonstrated tetracycline resistance (MIC ‚â•2 mcg/mL); one was ciprofloxacin-resistant (MIC 16.0 mcg/mL). None exhibited reduced susceptibility to cefixime or ceftriaxone. Clinicians treated thirteen (68{\%}) cases with ceftriaxone and azithromycin, one (5.3{\%}) with ceftriaxone and doxycycline, two (10.6{\%}) with study drug, and three (15.8{\%}) with 2g of azithromycin. Two of three men treated with azithromycin-monotherapy had a test of cure (TOC) and both had persistent infection; their isolates demonstrated azithromycin MICs of 32 mcg/mL and 4.0 mcg/mL.

7483,YES,Gomez-Gil2009,Article,"We describe 12 cases of linezolid-resistant Enterococcus faecalis. The present study was done in 2 wards of Hospital Universitario La Paz in Madrid, Spain. The 2 wards involved were the intensive care unit (ICU) and reanimation unit. Twelve clinical strains of E. faecalis reported by the clinical laboratory as linezolid resistant based on MICs determined by E-test (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden) were collected between September 2005 and October 2006. The MIC of linezolid for all the resistant isolates was {\textgreater}128 microg/mL. The isolates were analyzed for the presence of the G2576T mutation by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and pyrosequencing. Pyrosequencing showed that the first isolate had G and T at position 2576 in a 1:1 ratio, whereas the remaining ones had a wild type to mutant ratio of 1:3. PCR-RFLP showed that the mutations were in alleles 1, 3, and 4. The 12 isolates under investigation came from different patients but were indistinguishable by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (n = 7) and repetitive extragenic palindromic sequence (REP)-PCR (n = 12). This is the first report of a clonal outbreak of linezolid-resistant E. faecalis in Spain. To prevent or minimize the emergence of resistance, we should use linezolid strictly after the therapeutic indications, courses of treatment should be kept as short as possible, and risk factors for resistance development should be considered before starting. In addition, we suggest that susceptibility testing of clinically significant Gram-positive pathogens should be done in all cases of treatment failure, and, depending on the local epidemiology of each ICU, it might be advisable to do it before starting treatment with linezolid.",R Gomez-Gil and M P Romero-Gomez and A Garcia-Arias and M G Ubeda and M S Busselo and R Cisterna and A Gutierrez-Altes and J Mingorance,0732-8893,Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis,"*Disease Outbreaks,*Drug Resistance, Bacterial,Acetamides/*pharmacology,Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology,Bacterial Typing Techniques,Cluster Analysis,Cross Infection/*epidemiology/microbiology,DNA Fingerprinting,DNA, Bacterial/genetics,DNA, Ribosomal/genetics,Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field,Enterococcus faecalis/*drug effects/isolation {\&} pu,Female,Genotype,Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections/*epidemiology/m,Hospitals,Humans,Linezolid,Male,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Middle Aged,Oxazolidinones/*pharmacology,Point Mutation,Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods,Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length,Sequence Analysis, DNA,Spain,Young Adult",175--179,{Nosocomial outbreak of linezolid-resistant Enterococcus faecalis infection in a tertiary care hospital},NA,65,2009,2,"1879-0070

11875,MAYBE,Leitner2015,Article,"OBJECTIVES: An increase of severe infections caused by Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (SDSE) similar to infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes has been reported over the last years. Little is known about infections with SDSE in Austria. Therefore, we investigated a collection of 113 SDSE invasive and non-invasive isolates from different infection sites and type of infections as well as patients' characteristics. METHODS: The isolates were phenotypically identified and emm typed using the enlarged emm database from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Additionally, 13 antimicrobial agents were tested using EUCAST guidelines and virulence genes were investigated. RESULTS: Severe SDSE infections were most common in elderly men with underlying diseases especially diabetes mellitus. With VitekMS identification of SDSE isolates was successful to the species level only. Emm typing revealed 24 different emm types, one new type and one new subtype. StG485, stG6, stC74a, stG643, and stG480 were the predominant types in this study, stC74a and stG652 in invasive infections and stG643, stC74a and stG485 in non-invasive infections. Resistance was observed to tetracycline (62{\%}), macrolides (13{\%}) with one M phenotype, and clindamycin (12{\%}) presenting 6 constitutive MLS(B) phenotypes and 8 inducible MLS(B) phenotypes. Levofloxacin resistance was detected only in one isolate. All isolates tested for virulence genes were positive for scpA, ska, saga and slo. Superantigenic genes were negative except speG(dys) (positive 17/34; 50{\%}). CONCLUSION: This paper presents the first report of SDSE infections in Austria. Severe SDSE infections were found mainly in elderly men with underlying diseases. SDSE isolates demonstrated substantial emm type diversity without association with infections site or invasiveness.

21052,YES,Traore2012,Article,"OBJECTIVE: To identify strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) circulating in Bamako and to examine the relationship between the strains and their drug susceptibility profiles. METHODS: Between 2006 and 2010, we conducted a cross-sectional study using spoligotyping to identify strains of MTC recovered from 126 tuberculosis (TB) patients under treatment in Bamako, Mali. RESULT: Three members of the MTC were isolated: M. tuberculosis (71.4{\%}), M. africanum (27.8{\%}) and M. bovis (0.8{\%}). Of these, three strains were found to be the most prevalent: M. tuberculosis T1 (MTB T1; 38.9{\%}), M. africanum F2 (MAF2; 26.2{\%}) and M. tuberculosis Latin American and Mediterranean 10 (MTB LAM 10; 10.3{\%}). MAF2 and MTB LAM 10 strains have a lower risk of multidrug resistance (MDR) than MTB T1 (respectively OR 0.1, 95{\%}CI 0.03-0.4 and OR 0.1, 95{\%}CI 0.01-0.8).

1829,MAYBE,Bele2014,Article,"Multi drug resistant bacteria are emerging world wide as a threat to the favorable outcome of common infections in society and hospital settings. Production of $\beta$-lactamase enzyme by several gram negative and gram positive strains of bacteria is perhaps the most important single mechanism of resistance to penicillin's and cephalosporins. In the earlier days of antibiotic generation it was believed that cephalosporins were relatively immune to attack by $\beta$- lactamases, but it was surprising to find cephalosporin resistant Klebsiella spp. among the clinical isolates. The mechanism of this resistance was production of extended spectrum $\beta$-lactamases (ESBLs). So study was carried out on the ESBL isolates and their relative sensitivity against various generations and types of antibiotics from ICU of tertiary care. The study showed surprising results revealing the presence of ESBL in patients' samples. The most ESBL producing bacteria were E.coli, K.pneumoniae and Enterobacter species. The patients with longer stay in hospital were more prone to these diseases. Many of these were found out to be resistant to more than two antibiotics/drugs. They were categorized as MDRO.

METHODS: Sixty one carbapenem resistant clinical isolates of a total of 212 P. aeruginosa isolates cultured during the study period were screened for the presence of NDM-1by PCR. Clinical characteristics of the NDM-1 positive isolates were studied and outcome of the patients was followed up. RESULTS: Of the 61 isolates, NDM-1 was detected in four isolates only. These were isolated from patients in the intensive care units and chest medicine ward. The source specimens were pus, sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage and endotracheal aspirate. The NDM-1 producers were susceptible only to polymyxin B. Only one patient responded to polymyxin B therapy, while the others succumbed to the infection. CONCLUSION: These findings reveal that NDM-1 is not a major mechanism mediating carbapenem resistance in P. aeruginosa in this centre.
