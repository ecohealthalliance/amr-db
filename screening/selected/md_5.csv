15553,MAYBE,Ongen2013,Article,"Introduction: Aeromonas spp. are emerging agents of gastroenteritis. Since most of the species produce inducible type chromosomal betalactamase, resistance can develop during beta-lactam therapy [1]. Objectives: It was aimed to investigate the frequency of Aeromonas spp. in stool samples of patients with gastroenteritis between January 2007 and June 2012 and to determine their antibiotic susceptibilities. Methods: Stool samples were inoculated onto 5{\%} sheep blood agar, MacConkey agar, Hektoen enteric agar, selenite F and Gram negative broth.Media were incubated aerobically at 35-37°C. Oxidase positive Gram negative rods on blood agar were investigated for Aeromonas spp. by API 32 GN and VITEK 2 systems (bioM{\'{e}}rieux). Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ampicillin-sulbactam, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefoxitine, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, imipenem, meropenem, ertapenem, aztreonam, gentamicin, amikacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, co-trimoxazole, tetracycline and chloramphenicol susceptibilities were determined by disc diffusion method according to CLSI M45-A2 criteria [2]. Results: 60 (0.6{\%}) Aeromonas spp. were isolated from 10,666 stool samples. Between 2007-2012; Aeromonas spp. was isolated at the rates of 0.4{\%}, 0.12{\%}, 0.45{\%}, 0.2{\%}, 1.1{\%} and 0.7{\%} respectively. Fortythree (72{\%}) isolates were identified as A. hydrophila/caviae, 8 (13{\%}) as A. sobria, 3 (5{\%}) as A. veronii and 6 (10{\%}) as Aeromonas spp. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes were positive for 25{\%} of the samples in which Aeromonas was isolated. Of the stool samples in which Aeromonas spp. was isolated, approximately 3/4 were watery with mucus and 6{\%} were watery with blood and mucus. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was carried out for 52 isolates and all isolates were found to be susceptible to imipenem, meropenem and cefepime. The highest resistance rate was for ampicillin- sulbactam (92{\%}) followed by amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (63{\%}) and co-trimoxazole (37{\%}). Except for tetracycline (19.2{\%}) and cefoxitin (13.5{\%}), resistance rates of other antibiotics were found to be lower than 10{\%}. Conclusion: As a result, in diarrheagenic patients, the presence of Aeromonas spp. and their antibiotic susceptiblities should be followed up.",B Ongen and M Ilktac and A Aydin and H Nazik,0924-8579,International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents,"Aeromonas,Asia,Gram negative bacterium,agar,amikacin,amoxicillin,antibiotic agent,antibiotic sensitivity,aztreonam,beta lactam,blood,cefepime,cefotaxime,cefoxitin,ceftazidime,chemotherapy,chloramphenicol,ciprofloxacin,clavulanic acid,cotrimoxazole,disk diffusion,ertapenem,feces culture,gastroenteritis,gentamicin,human,imipenem,infection,levofloxacin,meropenem,microbiology,mucus,neutrophil,oxidoreductase,patient,piperacillin,selenite,sheep,species,sultamicillin,tazobactam,tetracycline,therapy",S73--S74,{Aeromonas species isolated from stool cultures and their susceptibilities to various antibiotics},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L71102790 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0924-8579(13)70345-5 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=09248579{\&}id=doi:10.1016{\%}2FS0924-8579{\%}2813{\%}2970345-5{\&}atitle=Aer,42,2013,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,MAYBE,Jake,MAYBE,Nchedo,Nchedo,Mushtaq,YES,,

These isolates comprise two major epidemic pulsed-field electrophoresis-defined clones plus two minor clones. In addition to the ESBL-mediated resistance, all strains uniformly showed resistance to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin and tobramycin. The beta-lactamases involved in this resistance phenotype were TEM-1, SHV-1, and CTX-M-15, as demonstrated by isoelectric focusing, PCR amplification, and sequencing. TEM-1 and CTX-M-15 beta-lactamases, as well as the aminoglycoside resistance determinants, were encoded in plasmids that could be transferred to Escherichia coli by conjugation. In three of the infected patients with the predominant clone, cefoxitin resistance development (MICs {\textgreater}128 mg/L) was documented. The analysis of the outer membrane proteins of the cefoxitin-susceptible and cefoxitin-resistant isolates revealed that the former expressed only one of the two major porins, OmpK36, whereas in the latter, the expression of Ompk36 was altered or abolished. This is the first report of CTX-M-15-producing K. pneumoniae in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

3621,YES,Chen2009b,Article,"Objective: To investigate the mechanism of carbapenem resistance and the occurrence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants qnr and aac(6′)-Ib-cr in a clinical isolate of Enterobacter cloacae. Methods: An ertapenem-resistant E. cloacae ZY106, which was isolated from liquor puris of a female gastric cancer patient in a Chinese hospital, was investigated. Antibiotic susceptibilities were determined by agar dilution method. Conjugation experiments, isoelectric focusing, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and DNA sequence analyses of plasmid-mediated carbapenemases and quinolone resistance determinants were preformed to confirm the genotype. Outer membrane proteins (OMPs) were examined by urea-sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Urea-SDS-PAGE). Results: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of imipenem, meropenem, and ertapenem for ZY106 were 2, 4, and 16 $\mu$g/ml, respectively. Conjugation studies with Escherichia coli resulted in the transfer of significantly reduced carbapenem susceptibility. ZY106 produced IMP-1 metallo-$\beta$-lactamase and CTX-M-3 extended-spectrum $\beta$-lactamase, and E. coli transconjugant produced IMP-1. Plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinant qnrS1 was detected in ZY106. Transfer of the qnrS1-encoding-plasmid into E. coli by conjugation resulted in intermediate resistance to ciprofloxacin in E. coli transconjugant. Urea-SDS-PAGE analysis of OMPs showed that ZY106 lacked an OMP of approximately 38 kDa. Conclusion: It is the first IMP-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae in China and the first report of a clinical isolate that harbors both blaIMP and qnrS genes as well. The blaIMP-1, blaCTX-M-3, and qnrS1 are encoded at three different plasmids. IMP-1 combined with the loss of an OMP possibly resulted in ertapenem resistance and reduced imipenem and meropenem susceptibility in E. cloacae. {\textcopyright} Zhejiang University and Springer-Verlag GmbH 2009.",L R Chen and H W Zhou and J C Cai and R Zhang and G X Chen,"1673-1581

5811,MAYBE,Elhani2015,Article,"Tetracycline resistance has been postulated as a potential phenotypic marker of livestockassociated lineage ST398 amongst meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clinical isolates in some European hospitals. The objective of this study was to determine if this marker could also be applied to Maghrebian countries. In total, 99 MRSA isolates were collected in a Tunisian hospital during January 2011–October 2012, and 24 tetracycline-resistant MRSA isolates of this collection were characterized. All isolates were tested for antimicrobial resistance phenotypes and genotypes, molecular typing, and virulence genes. Multilocus sequence typing showed that the majority of the isolates (19/24) belonged to clonal complex CC8 (ST247, n512 isolates; ST239, n56isolates; ST241, n51 isolate). The remaining isolates belonged to CC398 (ST398, n51 isolate), CC5 (ST5 and ST641, n52 isolates), and CC80 (ST728, n52 isolates). Spa typing discriminated MRSA in eight spa types: t052 (n512 isolates), t037 (n55 isolates), t044 (n52 isolates), and t899, t129, t311, t1744 and the new t14712 (n51 isolate each). Three agr groups were found amongst the studied isolates: agr group I (n520 isolates), agr group II (n52) and agr group III (n52 isolates). We report the detection of one MRSA ST398–t899 isolate in the nasal sample of a farmer patient in Tunisia, representing the first report of ST398 in humans in Africa. Tetracycline resistance seems not to be a good phenotypic marker for MRSA ST398 strains in Tunisia, where CC8 was the most prevalent lineage.

Methods: Aliquots from residual specimens obtained from symptomatic (urethritis) and asymptomatic men at ages 18- 52 years, enrolled from seven diverse US clinical sites, including obstetrics and gynecology, family planning, public health and sexually transmitted disease clinics, were tested using a research-use-only transcription mediated amplification (TMA) assay for Mgen (Hologic, Inc.). First-catch urine or urethral swab specimens positive for Mgen by TMAwere evaluated by reverse transcription-PCR and Sanger sequencing of Mgen 23s ribosomal RNA, or mRNA from parC and gyrA genes to identify the presence of macrolide and fluoroquinolone antibiotic resistance-associated mutations (MT- 23s, MT-gyrA, MT-parC, respectively). Results: Of 50 Mgen TMA-positive subjects, 21 (42{\%}) harbored MT-23s mutations at position 2058 (A2058G, A2058C, A2058T) or position 2059 (A2059G). Of these 21, nine subjects (42.9{\%}) were symptomatic. MT-23s mutations were more prevalent in subjects co-infected with Chlamydia (3/8, 37.5{\%}) compared to subjects infected with Mgen alone (3/22, 13.6{\%}). Of 15 subjects with gryA sequencing results, three (20{\%}) had MT-gyrA, while nine of 25 (36{\%}) had MT-parC. Finally, of nine subjects with 23s, gyrA and parC sequencing results, two (22.2{\%}) had MT-23s and either MT-gyrA or MT-parC. Conclusions: Mgen strains containing macrolide and fluoroquinolone resistance markers were highly prevalent in the urogenital tracts of this cohort of male US subjects.

4379,MAYBE,Creighton2013,Article,"Staphylococcus saprophyticus is commonly observed in the clinical laboratory as a causative agent of uncomplicated urinary tract infections, most often encountered in young female patients in primary care. It is usually susceptible to antimicrobials used to treat simple cystitis, although resistance, particularly to $\beta$-lactams, has been reported internationally. However, the true resistance prevalence may be underestimated as susceptibility testing for S. saprophyticus is not recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). We report the isolation of a methicillin-and multi-resistant S. saprophyticus and a two year retrospective investigation of S. saprophyticus clinical isolates which revealed the presence of S. saprophyticus infections outside of the urogenital tract and the existence of other multi-resistant isolates.

METHODS: A 77-year-old white man with end-stage multiple myeloma was hospitalized for congestive heart failure and pneumonia. During hospitalization, the patient developed conjunctivitis. Cultures of the eye were directly plated into several media. The bacterium was tested for antibiotic minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) with the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) method. RESULTS: Culture of the affected eye grew Enterococcus faecalis resistant to vancomycin. Topical treatment with moxifloxacin 0.5{\%} (Vigamox; Alcon, Ft. Worth, TX) resulted in clinical resolution despite a MIC showing resistance. CONCLUSION: Clinical resolution of VRE conjunctivitis was shown with topical moxifloxacin therapy in this case.

10886,YES,Kohlenberg2009,Article,"A prolonged outbreak of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii in a German university medical centre in 2006 was investigated; the investigation included a descriptive epidemiological analysis, a case-control study, environmental sampling, molecular typing of A. baumannii isolates using PFGE and repetitive-sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR) typing, and detection of OXA-type carbapenemases by multiplex PCR. Thirty-two patients acquired the outbreak strain in five intensive care units (ICUs) and two regular wards at a tertiary care hospital within 10 months. The outbreak strain was resistant to penicillins, cephalosporins, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, imipenem and meropenem, and carried the blaOXA-23-like gene. Based on PFGE and rep-PCR typing, it was shown to be related to the pan-European A. baumannii clone II. The most likely mode of transmission was cross-transmission from colonized or infected patients via the hands of health-care workers, with the severity of disease and intensity of care (therapeutic intervention scoring system 28 score .median) being independently associated with acquisition of the outbreak strain (odds ratio 6.67, 95{\%} confidence interval 1.55-36.56). Control of the outbreak was achieved by enforcement of standard precautions, education of personnel, screening of ICU patients for carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii and cohorting of patients.

1449,YES,Banerjee2014b,Article,"Introduction: Stenotrophomonas multophilia is a ubiquitous organism, which has emerged as an opportunistic pathogen mainly in the immune compromised host. This organism is not a virulent pathogen, but has an amazing ability to survive in a wide range of environments. It is frequently multi resistant to antibiotics. Objectives: The main objectives of our study were to report the emergence of S. multophilia and the risk factors associated for acquiring the pathogen in adult immune compromised patients who were admitted in intensive care unit (ICU) of Apollo Gleneagles Hospital, Kolkata. Materials and Methods: Over an 18 month period of time starting from January 2012 to August 2013, 48 patients were diagnosed to have infection with S. multophilia. Most of these patients had lower respiratory tract infections and few had reported bacteremia as well with this pathogen. All these patients were treated in our ICU and the surveillance was carried out to detect possible source from medical devices (indwelling) that were used. Results: Out of 48 patients S. multophilia were detected in 29 patients from the respiratory tract (bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, ET secretion, sputum), in 9 patients from blood cultures, in 6 patients from central venous catheter, in 2 patients from wound swab and in 2 patients from ascitic fluid. Among 48 patients, 36 patients were intubated and ventilated. All these patients had a common denominator of admission in our ICU and use of common broad spectrum antibiotics.

Italy is usually considered a country characterized by a low prevalence of MDR S. pneumoniae. We describe the occurrence of bacterial meningitis sustained by a MDR S. pneumoniae strain in Italy. The first-line treatment was started with ceftriaxone and dexamethasone, but after the identification of such a resistant strain a second-line regimen was needed. The new regimen was chosen on both susceptibility and pharmacokinetic criteria. Linezolid and levofloxacin were started and a dramatic improvement was observed. A more sensitive anamnesis revealed some elements known to be associated to a MDR S. pneumoniae occurrence (immunesuppression, former antibiotic therapy). So this case should pinpoint our attention on risk factors of MDR for a careful choice of antibiotic therapy in serious pneumococcal infections. {\textcopyright} 2014 Edizioni Scientifiche per l'Informazione su Farmaci e Terapia.",G Cenderello and E Pontali and A Torresin and G Milano and F Ansaldi and M Feasi and D Usiglio and M Mori and G Icardi and G Cassola,"1973-9478

The New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) is a major problem around the world. The purpose of this article is to address the NDM-1 Klebsiella pneumoniae epidemic detected in eight cases in our hospital. METHODS: Bacteria identified in this epidemic were from patients already admitted to the intensive care unit of the Sakarya University Training and Research Hospital during efforts toward establishment of infection surveillance and control program. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of strains was performed using the VITEK 2 system (bioMerieux, France), E-test gradient strips (bioMerieux, France), and the disc diffusion test. For the metallo-beta-lactamase activity, the combined disc diffusion test and modified Hodge test as phenotypic tests were performed. To identify the resistance gene, the Xpert Carba-R kit (Cepheid Inc., USA) and an in-house multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method designed for five common carbapenemase genes (IMP, VIM, KPC, NDM-1, and OXA-48) were employed. The clonal relationship of these strains was explored by the repetitive PCR (rep-PCR, DiversiLab System, bioMerieux, France) method. RESULTS: During the December 2014 to March 2015 period, NDM-1 positive K. pneumoniae strains were detected in eight patients. All of these strains were found to produce NDM-1, while two of them also revealed the presence of OXA-48. The rep-PCR results reveal a clonal proximity of 95 {\%} for six of the eight strains. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest the tendency of NDM-1-producing strains to spread in our country as well. A carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae threat may pose a great risk to our country.

7220,MAYBE,Ghebremedhin2009,Article,"Phenotypic, genotypic, and toxin gene analyses have not yet been done all in one for the Nigerian Staphylococcus aureus population. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the molecular epidemiology and genetic diversity of S. aureus strains at the largest university clinic in Ibadan, Nigeria. From 1,300 patients' clinical samples collected at the University Teaching Hospital in Ibadan, Nigeria, during a 1-year-surveillance in 2007, 346 nonduplicate S. aureus isolates were obtained. All isolates underwent antibiotic susceptibility testing, toxin gene analysis, multilocus sequence typing, agr group typing, and spa typing. For methicillin (meticillin)-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing was also performed. Of the 346 isolates, 20.23{\%} were methicillin resistant. Thirty-three patients' isolates (47.15{\%}) fulfilled the definition criteria for community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) according to a review of the medical charts. The majority of MRSA strains analyzed were isolated from surgical or pediatric patients. The commonest types of MRSA infection identified were surgical-site infections ({\textgreater}70{\%}), whereas those for CA-MRSA were conjunctivitis and otitis (19 patients [57.6{\%}]) and accidental skin and subcutaneous tissue infections (14 patients [42.4{\%}]). The methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strains (ST1, ST5, ST15, ST7, ST8, ST25, ST30, ST72, ST80, ST121, and ST508) were heterogeneous by phenotypic and genotypic analyses. The first report of a Panton-Valentine leukocidin-positive ST88 strain (agr III, SCCmec IV) in Nigeria, as well as genetic analyses of this strain, is presented in this study. The ST88 strain was resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole as well as to penicillin and oxacillin.
