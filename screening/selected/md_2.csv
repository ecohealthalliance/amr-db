7979,MAYBE,Gurjav2016,Article,"Background Mongolia has high and rising rates of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Spatio-temporal and programmatic evidence suggests a major contribution from MDR-TB transmission, but genotypic evidence has not been assessed. Methods All MDR-TB cases identified during 2012 were examined. Demographic and bacteriological data were obtained from the National Tuberculosis Reference Laboratory. Isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from culture-confirmed category 1 treatment failures were genotyped using 24-loci mycobacterium interspersed repetitive unit (MIRU-24) analysis. Results Of the 210 MDR-TB cases identified, 115 (54.8{\%}) were treatment failures (34.8{\%} category 1; 20.0{\%} category 2). Streptomycin resistance was present in 156 (74.3{\%}) cases; including 55/73 (75.3{\%}) category 1 treatment failures who had never been exposed to streptomycin. Among category 1 treatment failures, Beijing lineage strains predominated (88.0{\%}; 59/67 of genotyped isolates). MIRU-24 clustering was documented in 62.7{\%} (42/67) of strains; 55.2{\%} (37/67) remained clustered when drug susceptibility test results were considered. In total 59.5{\%} (25/42) of clustered strains were Beijing lineage and demonstrated in-vitro resistance to all first-line drugs tested. Conclusion The MDR-TB epidemic in Mongolia appears to be driven by primary transmission of Beijing lineage strains resistant to all first-line drugs. Enhanced infection control strategies together with early MDR-TB case detection and appropriate treatment are necessary to limit escalation of the MDR-TB epidemic.",U Gurjav and B Erkhembayar and B Burneebaatar and E Narmandakh and O Tumenbayar and G A Hill-Cawthorne and B J Marais and V Sintchenko,"1873-281X

5606,MAYBE,Durante-Mangoni2014,Article,"BACKGROUND: Infective endocarditis (IE) due to gram-negative (GN) bacilli is uncommon. Although multi- and extensively-drug resistant (MDR/XDR) GN infections are emerging, very few data are available on IE due to these microrganisms. METHODS: In this study, we describe the clinical characteristics, course and outcome of five contemporary, definite, MDR/XDR GNIE cases seen at our centre. RESULTS: All patients had been admitted to a hospital during the 6months before IE onset, 2 were on hemodialysis and 3 on intravenous medications. Three of the 5 cases were hospital-acquired. Intracardiac prosthetic devices were present in all cases (3 central venous lines, 2 prosthetic heart valves, 2 pacemakers). Mean Charlson comorbidity index was 5.8. Causative pathogens were XDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2 cases), XDR Acinetobacter baumannii, MDR Burkolderia cepacia and MDR Escherichia coli (1 case each). Concomitant pathogens with a MDR/XDR phenotype were isolated in 4 patients. Both valves and intracardiac devices and left and right sides of the heart were involved. The rate of complications was high. Antibiotic treatment hinged on the use of colistin, a carbapenem or both. Cardiovascular surgical procedures were performed in 3 patients. Despite aggressive therapeutic regimens, outcomes were poor. Clearance of bacteremia was obtained in 3 patients, in-hospital death occurred in 3 patients, only 1 patient survived during follow up. CONCLUSIONS: MDR/XDR GN are emerging as a cause of IE in carriers of intracardiac prostheses with extensive healthcare contacts and multiple comorbidities. Resistant GNIE has a complicated course and shows a dismal prognosis.",E Durante-Mangoni and R Andini and F Agrusta and D Iossa and I Mattucci and M Bernardo and R Utili,"1879-0828

873,MAYBE,Antonov2015,Article,"Topical mupirocin is used widely to treat skin and soft tissue infections and to eradicate nasal carriage of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Few studies to date have characterized the rates of S. aureus mupirocin resistance in pediatric populations. We retrospectively studied 358 unique S. aureus isolates obtained from 249 children seen in a predominantly out-patient setting by the Division of Pediatric Dermatology at a major academic center in New York City between 1 May 2012 and 17 September 2013. Mupirocin resistance rates and the associated risk factors were determined using a logistic regression analysis. In our patient population, 19.3{\%} of patients had mupirocin-resistant S. aureus isolates at the time of their first culture, and 22.1{\%} of patients with S. aureus infection had a mupirocin-resistant isolate at some time during the study period. Overall, 31.3{\%} of all S. aureus isolates collected during the study period were resistant to mupirocin. Prior mupirocin use was strongly correlated (odds ratio [OR] = 26.5; P = {\textless}0.001) with mupirocin resistance. Additional risk factors for mupirocin resistance included methicillin resistance, atopic dermatitis (AD), epidermolysis bullosa (EB), immunosuppression, and residence in northern Manhattan and the Bronx. Resistance to mupirocin is widespread in children with dermatologic complaints in the New York City area, and given the strong association with mupirocin exposure, it is likely that mupirocin use contributes to the increased resistance. Routine mupirocin testing may be important for MRSA decolonization strategies or the treatment of minor skin infections in children.",N K Antonov and M C Garzon and K D Morel and S Whittier and P J Planet and C T Lauren,0066-4804,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,",Adolescent,Adult,Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology,Bacterial,Child,Drug Resistance,Female,Humans,Infant,Logistic Models,Male,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Multiple,Mupirocin/*therapeutic use,Newborn,Preschool,Prevalence,Retrospective Studies,Staphylococcal Infections/*drug therapy/*microbiol,Staphylococcus aureus,Staphylococcus aureus/drug effects/*metabolism,United States,Young Adult,adolescent,adult,antibiotic resistance,article,atopic dermatitis,bacterium culture,bacterium isolate,child,epidermolysis bullosa,female,human,immune deficiency,infant,major clinical study,male,methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus,newborn,nonhuman,priority journal,pseudomonic acid,residential area,retrospective study",3350--3356,{High prevalence of mupirocin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus isolates from a pediatric population},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L604426287 http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AAC.00079-15 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=10986596{\&}id=doi:10.1128{\%}2FAAC.00079-15{\&}atitle=High+prevalence+of+mupir,59,2015,6,"From Duplicate 1 (High prevalence of mupirocin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus isolates from a pediatric population - Antonov, N K; Garzon, M C; Morel, K D; Whittier, S; Planet, P J; Lauren, C T)

14500,YES,Mshana2011,Article,"Enterobacter hormaechei and Cronobacter sakazakii are amongst the most important causes of outbreaks of neonatal sepsis associated with powdered milk. In this study, we report for the first time an outbreak of a novel Enterobacter sp. harbouring blaCTX-M-15 in a neonatal unit in Tanzania. Seventeen Gram-negative enteric isolates from neonatal blood cultures were studied. Antibiotic susceptibility was assessed by disc diffusion testing, and the presence of the blaCTX-M-15 gene was established by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. Isolates were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Identification by biochemical profiling was followed by nucleotide sequencing of 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA), rpoB and hsp60 alleles. Environmental sampling was done and control measures were established. Isolates were initially misidentified based on their fermentation characteristics and agglutination as Salmonella enterica serotype Paratyphi. All isolates were resistant to multiple antibiotics, except for ciprofloxacin and carbapenems, and were found to harbour blaCTX-M-15 on a 291-kb narrow-range plasmid. PFGE analysis indicated the clonal outbreak of a single strain, infecting 17 neonates with a case fatality rate of 35{\%}. The same strain was isolated from a milk bucket. Phylogenetic analysis using 16S rDNA, rpoB and hsp60 sequences permitted no definitive identification, clustering the strains in the Enterobacter cloacae complex with similarities of 92-98.8{\%}. The data describe an outbreak of a novel blaCTX-M-15-positive, multiresistant Enterobacter strain in an African neonatal unit that can easily be misidentified taxonomically. These data highlight the need for constant surveillance of bacteria harbouring extended-spectrum $\beta$-lactamases as well as improvements in hygiene measures in developing countries. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V. and the International Society of Chemotherapy.",S E Mshana and L Gerwing and M Minde and T Hain and E Domann and E Lyamuya and T Chakraborty and C Imirzalioglu,"0924-8579

2587,MAYBE,Breathnach2012,Article,"BACKGROUND: Multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDR-P) expressing VIM-metallo-beta-lactamase is an emerging infection control problem. The source of many such infections is unclear, though there are reports of hospital outbreaks of P. aeruginosa related to environmental contamination, including tap water. AIM: We describe two outbreaks of MDR-P, sensitive only to colistin, in order to highlight the potential for hospital waste-water systems to harbour this organism. METHODS: The outbreaks were investigated by a combination of descriptive epidemiology, inspection and microbiological sampling of the environment, and molecular strain typing. FINDINGS: The outbreaks occurred in two English hospitals; each involved a distinct genotype of MDR-P. One outbreak was hospital-wide, involving 85 patients, and the other was limited to four cases in one specialized medical unit. Extensive environmental sampling in each outbreak yielded MDR-P only from the waste-water systems. Inspection of the environment and estates records revealed many factors that may have contributed to contamination of clinical areas, including faulty sink, shower and toilet design, clean items stored near sluices, and frequent blockages and leaks from waste pipes. Blockages were due to paper towels, patient wipes, or improper use of bedpan macerators. Control measures included replacing sinks and toilets with easier-to-clean models less prone to splashback, educating staff to reduce blockages and inappropriate storage, reviewing cleaning protocols, and reducing shower flow rates to reduce flooding. These measures were followed by significant reductions in cases. CONCLUSION: The outbreaks highlight the potential of hospital waste systems to act as a reservoir of MDR-P and other nosocomial pathogens.",A S Breathnach and M D Cubbon and R N Karunaharan and C F Pope and T D Planche,0195-6701,J Hosp Infect,"*Disease Outbreaks,*Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial,Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology,Hospitals,Humans,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Molecular Typing,Pseudomonas Infections/*epidemiology/microbiology,Pseudomonas aeruginosa/classification/*drug effect,Waste Water/*microbiology",19--24,{Multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa outbreaks in two hospitals: association with contaminated hospital waste-water systems},NA,82,2012,1,"1532-2939

Its bla{\textless}inf{\textgreater}KPC{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} determinant was carried by a ColE1 plasmid, pKBuS13, that showed the Tn4401b::bla{\textless}inf{\textgreater}KPC-2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} transposon inserted into the regulatory region of an Xer site-specific recombination locus. This interfered with the correct resolution of plasmid multimers into monomers, lowering plasmid stability and leading to overestimation of the number of plasmids harbored by a single host cell. Sequencing of the fragments adjacent to Tn4401b detected a region that did not have significant matches in databases other than the genome of a carbapenem-resistant Escherichia coli strain collected during the same year at a hospital in Boston.

22167,MAYBE,Wang2016a,Article,"The purpose of this study was to characterize mechanisms of plasmid-mediated antimicrobial resistance in Shigella boydii. S. boydii strain 2246 with resistance to ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone and azithromycin was isolated from a human case of watery diarrhea in a Chinese public hospital. Resistance in strain 2246 to ceftriaxone and azithromycin was attributable to the presence of blaCTX-M-14, and erm(B) and mph(A), respectively, which were co-located on a multidrug-resistant (MDR) plasmid p2246-CTXM. p2246-CTXM represented a novel IncFII-type MDR plasmid with a very complex chimera structure. Its master backbone was genetically closely related to the R100 plasmid, but p2246-CTXM had evolved to integrate additional R100-unrelated backbone regions as well as massive exogenous mobile elements that carried multiple resistance determinants. In p2246-CTXM, erm(B) together with its leading peptide gene erm(C), mph(A) together with its regulatory genes mrx and mphR(A), and blaCTX-M-14 were captured by three different mobile elements Tn6295, the IS26-mph(A)-mrx-mphR(A)-IS6100 unit, and a truncated ISEcp1-blaCTX-M-14-IS903D-iroN transposition unit, respectively, all of which were harbored in a large Tn3-family transposon Tn6285. p2246-CTXM still carried additional resistance determinants mer (mercury resistance), aacA4 (aminoglycoside resistance), cmlA1 (chloramphenicol resistance), and qacED1 (quaternary ammonium compound resistance).

16267,MAYBE,Peleg2007,Article,"Objectives: Tigecycline has shown in vitro activity against Acinetobacter baumannii. Yet, published clinical experience with tigecycline use outside clinical trials is lacking. We describe, for the first time, bloodstream infection caused by tigecycline-non-susceptible A. baumannii occurring in patients receiving tigecycline for other indications. The possible mechanisms of resistance and pharmacokinetic limitations of the drug are addressed. Methods: The clinical records of involved patients were systematically reviewed. Tigecycline susceptibility testing was initially performed using the Etest method and confirmed by agar dilution. Involved isolates underwent PFGE and exposure to phenyl-arginine-$\beta$-naphthylamide (PA$\beta$N), an efflux pump inhibitor. Results: Two patients developed A. baumannii bloodstream infection while receiving tigecycline. Tigecycline was administered for other indications for 9 and 16 days, respectively, before the onset of A. baumannii infection. Patient 1 died of overwhelming A. baumannii infection and Patient 2 recovered after a change in antibiotic therapy. The MICs of tigecycline were 4 and 16 mg/L, respectively. Both isolates had a multidrug-resistant phenotype and were genotypically unrelated. After exposure to PA$\beta$N, the MICs reduced to 1 and 4 mg/L, respectively. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first clinical description of bloodstream infection caused by tigecycline-non-susceptible A. baumannii. Such resistance appears to be at least partly attributable to an efflux pump mechanism. Given the reported low serum tigecycline levels, we urge caution when using this drug for treatment of A. baumannii bloodstream infection.

A novel acquired carbapenemase, New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1 (NDM-1), has recently been described in the United Kingdom and Sweden, mostly in patients who had received care on the Indian subcontinent. We conducted a survey among 29 European countries (the European Union Member States, Iceland and Norway) to gather information on the spread of NDM-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae in Europe, on public health responses and on available national guidance on detection, surveillance and control. A total of 77 cases were reported from 13 countries from 2008 to 2010. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most frequently reported species with 54{\%}. Among 55 cases with recorded travel history, 31 had previously travelled or been admitted to a hospital in India or Pakistan and five had been hospitalised in the Balkan region. Possible nosocomial acquisition accounted for 13 of 77 cases. National guidance on NDM-1 detection was available in 14 countries and on NDM-1 control in 11 countries. In conclusion, NDM-1 is spreading across Europe, where it is frequently linked to a history of healthcare abroad, but also to emerging nosocomial transmission. National guidance in response to the threat of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae is available in approximately half of the surveyed European countries.

New Delhi metallo-$\beta$-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) is among the most recently discovered carbapenemases. Aim To report the first outbreak of NDM-1 CPE in Ireland, including microbiological and epidemiological characteristics, and assessing the impact of infection prevention and control measures. Methods This was a retrospective microbiological and epidemiological review. Cases were defined as patients with a CPE-positive culture. Contacts were designated as roommates or ward mates. Findings This outbreak involved 10 patients with a median age of 71 years (range: 45–90), located in three separate but affiliated healthcare facilities. One patient was infected (the index case); the nine others were colonized. Nine NDM-1-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, an NDM-1-producing Escherichia coli and a K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Enterobacter cloacae were detected between week 24, 2014 and week 37, 2014. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis demonstrated similarity. NDM-1-positive isolates were meropenem resistant with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from 12 to 32 $\mu$g/mL. All were tigecycline susceptible (MICs ≤1 $\mu$g/mL). One isolate was colistin resistant (MIC 4.0 $\mu$g/mL; mcr-1 gene not detected). In 2015, four further NDM-1 isolates were detected. Conclusion The successful management of this outbreak was achieved via the prompt implementation of enhanced infection prevention and control practices to prevent transmission. These patients did not have a history of travel outside of Ireland, but several had frequent hospitalizations in Ireland, raising concerns regarding the possibility of increasing but unrecognized prevalence of NDM-1 and potential decline in value of travel history as a marker of colonization risk.",C O'Connor and M Cormican and T W Boo and E McGrath and B Slevin and A O'Gorman and M Commane and S Mahony and E O'Donovan and J Powell and R Monahan and C Finnegan and M G Kiernan and J C Coffey and L Power and N H O'Connell and C P Dunne,"1532-2939

The strain was isolated from a wound swab in the patient who had a surgical wound infection previously treated with meropenem. Limited choice of antibiotics that can treat infections caused by these pathogens indicates the necessity of accurate identification of multiple resistant gram-negative microorganisms and mechanisms of their resistance. Recognition of multiresistant gram-negative microorganisms emphasizes the importance of continuous microbiological monitoring of patients, especially in intensive care units. In the investigated institution there was no secondary spread of this strain.

5201,YES,Diaz2013,Article,"INTRODUCTION: Salmonella Enteritidis is recognized worldwide as one of the main agents of human gastrointestinal infection. Several reports indicate the presence of isolates with decreased sensitivity to ciprofloxacin that can lead to a delayed response or the development of resistance during treatment. OBJECTIVE: To describe and characterize isolates of Salmonella Enteritidis associated to an outbreak of food-borne diseases in Popayan, Cauca. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten Salmonella Enteritidis isolates from nine patients and one food sample (chicken sandwich) were analyzed by biochemical tests, serotyping and antimicrobial sensitivity. The minimum inhibitory concentration to ciprofloxacin was determined by E-test and the genetic profile of the isolates was tested by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) with XbaI and Blnl enzymes. RESULTS: Salmonella Enteritidis was identified in all isolates. They were resistant to nalidixic acid and had a decreased sensitivity to ciprofloxaxin between 0.25 and 0.5 mug/ml; all isolates were sensitive to all the other antimicrobials we tested. Ten isolates were grouped by PFGE with the XbaI enzyme in the COIN11.JEG.X01.0038 pattern, and seven isolates were confirmed with the BlnI enzyme using the COIN11.JEG.A26.0009 pattern. CONCLUSION: We report for the first time an outbreak of nalidixic acid-resistant Salmonella Enteritidis in Colombia and confirmed by phenotypic and genotypic analysis the association between the isolates from patients and the chicken sandwich as the source of infection.",M A Diaz and P L Diaz and E C Rodriguez and L A Montano and D M Gartner and M E Vernaza and V Eljach and M E Realpe,"0120-4157 (Print)

18401,MAYBE,Sarovich2012,Article,"Burkholderia pseudomallei, a bacterium that causes the disease melioidosis, is intrinsically resistant to many antibiotics. First-line antibiotic therapy for treating melioidosis is usually the synthetic $\beta$-lactam, ceftazidime (CAZ), as almost all B. pseudomallei strains are susceptible to this drug. However, acquired CAZ resistance can develop in vivo during treat- ment with CAZ, which can lead to mortality if therapy is not switched to a different drug in a timely manner. Serial B. pseudomallei isolates obtained from an acute Thai melioidosis patient infected by a CAZ susceptible strain, who ultimately succumbed to infection despite being on CAZ therapy for the duration of their infection, were analyzed. Isolates that developed CAZ resistance due to a proline to serine change at position 167 in the $\beta$-lactamase PenA were identi- fed. Importantly, these CAZ resistant isolates remained sensitive to the alternative melioidosis treatments; namely, amoxicillin-clavulanate, imipenem, and meropenem. Lastly, real-time polymerase chain reaction-based assays capable of rapidly identifying CAZ resistance in B. pseudomallei isolates at the position 167 mutation site were developed. The ability to rapidly identify the emergence of CAZ resistant B. pseudomallei populations in melioidosis patients will allow timely alterations in treatment strategies, thereby improving patient outcomes for this serious disease. {\textcopyright} 2012 Sarovich et al, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.",D S Sarovich and E P Price and D Limmathurotsakul and J M Cook and A T {von Schulze} and S R Wolken and P Keim and C Refidaff and T Pearson,1178-6973,Infection and Drug Resistance,"Burkholderia pseudomallei,abscess,adult,amino acid substitution,amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid,antibiotic resistance,article,bacterium isolate,beta lactamase,bioassay,case report,ceftazidime,ceftriaxone,clindamycin,clonal species,drug response,drug treatment failure,dyspnea,fever,human,hypotension,imipenem,immunofluorescence test,leg disease,male,melioidosis,meropenem,mixed infection,nonhuman,penA protein,pleura effusion,proline,real time polymerase chain reaction,recurrent disease,reinfection,sensitivity analysis,serine,thorax radiography,treatment duration,unclassified drug",129--132,{Development of ceftazidime resistance in an acute burkholderia pseudomallei infection},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L368202488 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=11786973{\&}id=doi:{\&}atitle=Development+of+ceftazidime+resistance+in+an+acute+burkholderia+pseudomallei+infection,5,2012,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,MAYBE,Brooke,MAYBE,Ayomide,Ayomide,Mushtaq_2,downloaded,,

15459,MAYBE,Oksuz2012,Article,"Background: Vibrios have been recognized as human pathogens, and they can be acquired through either ingestion of contaminated seafood or contact of traumatized skin with seawater. V.alginolyticus occasionally causes life-threatening infections in immunocompromised individuals. We describe a case of sepsis due to V. alginolyticus isolated from catheter of 19-year-old patient with hypercholesterolemyType 2a while he was 7 years old. The patient was admitted with high fever. He was applied routinally lipid aferesis. A catheter had inserted to him before one and a half years. Methods: Blood cultures were sent from the catheter and peripheral vein of the patient to the laboratory and evaluated on the BACTEC 9120 system (Becton Dickinson, USA). The same day, a positive signal was taken from the cathether while blood culture obtained from the peripheral vein remained negative. The positive blood culture bottle was cultured on sheep-blood and chocolated agar. After 24 hours, straight or curved, Gram-negative, oxidasepositive colonies were seen on blood and chocolated agar. Yellow colonies were seen on thiosulfate-citrate-bile salts-sucrose (TCBS) agar after 24 hours of incubation. The identification was confirmed with another biochemical tests. At the same time, the patient's general situation was deteriorated and went to sepsis. Blood cultures were sent again and the same bacteria was isolated again. Results: The result of blood cultures was reported as V.alginolyticus. The bacteria were identified as V. alginolyticus by the API system (bioMerieux, France) at a 95.3{\%} confidence level and by the VITEK 2 system (bioMerieux, France) at a 93{\%} confidence level. The strain was only found to be resistant to ampicillin, but susceptible to the other antibiotic classes. The patient therapy improved by early diagnosis and appropriate and discharged.

12401,MAYBE,Lo2013a,Article,"We recently isolated and discovered new Bradyrhizobiaceae microbes from the cryopreserved culture broth of blood samples from 3 patients with poorly defined illnesses using modified SP4 media and culture conditions coupled with genomic sequencing. Using a similar protocol, we studied a previously cryopreserved culture broth of blood sample from a patient who had succumbed to an acute onset of fulminant pulmonary illness. We report that two phases of microbial growth were observed in the re-initiated culture. Biochemical and genomic characterization revealed microbes isolated from the first phase of growth were new Afipia species of Bradyrhizobiaceae, tentatively named A. cberi with a ∼ 5 MB chromosome that was different from those of all previously known Afipia microbes including the newly discovered A. septicemium. The microbes isolated from the second phase of growth were prominent sugar assimilators, novel Phyllobacteriaceae, phylogenetically most closely related to Mesorhizobium and tentatively named M. hominis with a ∼ 5.5 MB chromosome. All A. cberi isolates carry a circular ∼ 140 KB plasmid. Some M. hominis isolates possess a circular ∼ 412 KB plasmid that can be lost in prolonged culture or passage. No antibiotics resistant genes could be identified in both of the A. cberi and M. hominis plasmids. Antibiotic susceptibility studies using broth culture systems revealed isolates of A. cberi could be sensitive to some antibiotics, but all isolates of M. hominis were resistant to essentially all tested antibiotics. However, the cell-free antibiotics susceptibility test results may not be applicable to clinical treatment against the microbes that are known to be capable of intracellular growth. It remains to be determined if the 2 previously unknown Rhizobiales were indeed pathogenic and played a role in the pulmonary disease process in this patient.

In blood and peritoneal fluid cultures, Enterobacter cloacae ESBL and Klebsiella pneumoniae were first isolated; then Acinetobacter baumannii was also detected. The targeted antibiotic therapy instituted did not bring the expected results. On day 5, tigecycline and imipenem were started and continued over 10 days.

In November 2010 the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) graded Ireland as only having sporadic occurrence of CPE. Aim: To describe the epidemiological and molecular typing analysis of the first outbreak of OXA-48-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae in an Irish tertiary care referral centre. Methods: Sixteen OXA-48-producing K.pneumoniae isolates were detected, from both clinical and screening specimens, and analysed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and by multi-locus sequence typing. Findings: Typing analysis revealed that two outbreak strains were circulating in the hospital, one among surgical patients and one among medical patients. The 'medical strain' ST13 had already been identified as an internationally disseminated clone, whereas the 'surgical strain' ST221 had not previously been reported as an OXA-48-carrying strain. Conclusion: Although the outbreak on surgical wards was successfully controlled by implementing strict infection control measures, intermittent detection of individual patients carrying the 'medical strain' of OXA-48 K.pneumoniae has persisted since then. The experience from this outbreak suggests that OXA-48 K.pneumoniae is endemic at low level in the healthcare setting in the Dublin region. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Healthcare Infection Society.",C Wrenn and D O'Brien and D Keating and C Roche and L Rose and A Ronayne and L Fenelon and S Fitzgerald and B Crowley and K Schaffer,"1532-2939

14509,YES,Mudzikati2015,Article,"Background: Septicaemia is the third most common cause of neonatal death after prematurity and birth asphyxia. The prevalence of neonatal sepsis and the spectrum of causative microorganisms fluctuates over time, thus facility-specific surveillance of neonatal bloodstream infections is important. Increasing levels of antimicrobial resistance documented worldwide, necessitate regular monitoring of institutional resistance patterns to ensure appropriate and effective empirical antimicrobial therapy. Method: The laboratory blood culture reports and patient records from a neonatal unit at a Botswana referral hospital were retrospectively reviewed to determine the one-year prevalence of neonatal sepsis and the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of common pathogens. Results: Of 909 neonates investigated for suspected sepsis using 1 119 blood cultures, 89 (9.8{\%}) had laboratory-confirmed episodes of bloodstream infection (septicaemia). The most prevalent pathogens included Klebsiella pneumoniae (29.4{\%}), group B streptococcus (16.3{\%}) and Escherichia coli (11.9{\%}). Blood culture contamination rates were high at 18.6{\%} (208/1 119). Gramnegative pathogens showed low susceptibility to gentamicin (40{\%}) and cefotaxime (47{\%}), but high susceptibility to amikacin (86{\%}). Streptococci and enterococci were moderately sensitive to ampicillin (79{\%}), and fully susceptible to vancomycin. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was not isolated. Exposure to maternal syphilis and previous antibiotic exposure were significantly associated with neonatal septicaemia. Conclusion: Neonatal sepsis is common, with a predominance of Gram-negative pathogens. The high rate of blood culture contamination should be addressed. Emerging antibiotic resistance may require clinicians to review currently used antibiotics for the empirical treatment of late-onset neonatal septicaemia.",L Mudzikati and A Dramowski,"2220-1084

We define the rate of pediatric MRSA carriage in the same population and characterize the associated bacterial genotypes by using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing. A prospective cohort study of MRSA carriage conducted over one month at the Angkor Hospital for Children, Siem Reap, Cambodia, identified MRSA carriage in 87 (3.5{\%}) of 2,485 children who came to the outpatient department, and 6 (4.1{\%}) of 145 inpatients, including at least two with cases of nosocomial acquisition. Genotyping of all 93 MRSA isolates resolved 5 genotypes. Most (91{\%}) isolates were assigned to sequence type 834. Only 28 (32{\%}) of 87 MRSA carriers identified in the outpatient department had no history of recent healthcare contact. The study findings have important implications for healthcare in a setting where diagnostic microbiology and access to antimicrobial drugs with efficacy against MRSA are limited.

16802,YES,Porres-Osante2014a,Article,"Objectives: To characterize the mechanisms involved in carbapenem resistance, as well as the genetic elements supporting their mobilization, in a multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli isolate. Methods: The E. coli isolate was obtained from a patient with fatal urinary sepsis. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by the disc diffusion and agar dilution methods. The E. coli molecular type and phylogroup were determined using multilocus sequence typing and the triple PCR technique, respectively. PCR and sequencing were used for virulence and resistance genotype characterization. Plasmid content and gene location were analysed by S1-PFGE, I-Ceu1-PFGE and hybridization experiments. Transformation assays were performed. Results: The E. coli strain, typed as ST448 and phylogroup B1, was resistant to all tested antibiotics except fosfomycin, tigecycline and tetracycline. The following resistance and virulence genetic structures were obtained: ISKpn7 + blaKPC-3 + ISKpn6 linked to Tn4401; tnpR + aac(6')-Ib'-9 + aadA1 + blaOXA-9 + tnpR + blaTEM-1a + tnpB + strB + strA + sul2; intI1 + blaVIM-1 + aac(6')-Ib' + aphA15 + aadA1 + catB2 + qacE$\Delta$1-sul1 + orf5; ISEcp1 + blaCMY-2; IS26 + blaSHV-12; aph(3')-I; aac(3)-IV; floR; catA; and fimA. Mutations in the ampC promoter (-18, -1 and +58) and substitutions in the GyrA (Ser-83→Leu and Asp-87→Asn) and ParC (Ser-80→Ile) proteins were observed. IncFII (ST2), IncA/C and ColETP plasmids of 145.5, 87 and {\textless}2 kb, respectively, were found. The blaVIM-1 gene was located in a non-typeable plasmid of {\textgreater}300 kb, and the blaKPC-3 gene in the 145.5 kb IncFII plasmid. Transformant strains carried the IncFII and ColETP plasmids, and the blaKPC-3, blaTEM-1a, blaOXA-9, aadA1, aac(6')-Ib'-9, aac(3)-IV and floR genes. Conclusions: This is the first report of the co-production of KPC-3, VIM-1, SHV-12, OXA-9 and CMY-2 in a unique clinical multiresistant E. coli isolate. The dissemination of these genes on mobile genetic elements is alarming and complicates antimicrobial therapies. {\textcopyright} The Author 2014.

There is rapid emergence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) Shigella spp. resulting in poor reliability of first line antibiotics like quinolones, co-trimoxazole and ampicillin. Ceftriaxone has been used as a reserved antibiotic for treatment of MDR Shigella spp. The authors report a case of ceftriaxone resistant Shigella flexneri successfully managed with meropenem. As occurrence of ceftriaxone resistant Shigella is still rare, the objective of reporting this case is to highlight the possible failure of ceftriaxone in treating shigellosis which if not detected timely can result in mortality. {\textcopyright} 2011 Dr. K C Chaudhuri Foundation.",N Goel and C Wattal and D Kaul and V K Khanna,0019-5456,Indian J Pediatr,",*Drug Resistance,Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use,Bacillary/*drug therapy,Bacterial,Ceftriaxone/*therapeutic use,Communicable Diseases,Dysentery,Emerging/*drug therapy,Female,Humans,Infant,Multiple,Shigella flexneri,Shigella/*drug effects,ampicillin,antibiotic resistance,antibiotic sensitivity,article,bacterial growth,case report,cefixime,ceftriaxone,ciprofloxacin,cotrimoxazole,dehydration,diarrhea,ertapenem,female,hemoglobin,hospital admission,hospital discharge,human,hypoglycemia,infant,infusion fluid,malnutrition,meropenem,minimum inhibitory concentration,nalidixic acid,nonhuman,seizure,shigellosis,tetracycline,twins",70--71,{Emergence of ceftriaxone resistant shigella},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L51788773 http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12098-011-0669-5 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=00195456{\&}id=doi:10.1007{\%}2Fs12098-011-0669-5{\&}atitle=Emergence+of+ce,80,2013,1,"From Duplicate 1 (Emergence of ceftriaxone resistant Shigella - Goel, N; Wattal, C; Kaul, D; Khanna, V K)

CASE: This is a 33 yo Filipino woman w/ no significant PMH except a prior+PPD in the Philippines in '99 s/p INH, rifampin and Ethionamide who presented w/ F/C, SOB and DOE after doing a marathon in Kentucky and enjoying some cave exploration. She was found to have bibasilar infiltrates w/ a cavitary mass and positive sputum for TB. She was empirically started on INH PZA EMB AMIK Cyclo Avelox but later found to be resistant to all first line drugs and eventually discharged on a regimen of PAS, Cycloserine, Ethionamide, Linezolid, Avelox and Amikacin after 3 months. Her sputum sample was sent to the CDC and National Jewish where she was further found to be resistant to Avelox and Ethionamide. In collaboration with the CDC she was eventually started on Bedaquiline as she was taken off the Amikacin after 6 months of therapy because of hearing loss and at this time is doing well as an outpatient w/ clearance of her sputum. She is doing well and will contnue on a treatment regimen for 2 years from original sputum clearance. DISCUSSION: Per the WHO in 2012, 8.6 million people fell ill with TB and 1.3 million died from TB. In 2013 Connecticut reported 62 cases of TB and only one patient who had MDR TB because of her resistance to first line agents rifampin and INH as well as ethambutol, pyrazinamide, xifloxicin. Extensively drug resistant TB (XDR TB) is a rare type of MDR TB that is resistant to isoniazid and rifampin, plus any fluoroquinolone and at least one of three injectable second-line drugs (i.e., amikacin, kanamycin, or capreomycin). MDR is a growing problem in the developing world with 450,000 cases reported in 2012 w/ 9.6 {\%} having XDR TB. The risk of MDR TB is rapidly increasing as in 2011 there were only 310,000 cases of MDR TB reported and this will present new challenges for future management of TB as more antibiotics become ineffective. Newer medications are being developed such as Bedaquiline to combat this growing threat of MDRTB with more in the pipeline as well.

13741,MAYBE,Mendes2016,Article,"Objective To report a case septic arthritis with a rare pathogen in a immunosuppressed child. Case description Male patient, 6 years old, had liver transplant 5 and half years ago due to biliary atresia. Patient was using tacrolimus 1mg q.12hours. This patient started to have pain in left foot and ankle and had one episode of fever 3 days before hospital admission. Physical Examination showed weight 17kg, height 109cm, temperature 36,4°C, with pain, swelling and heat in the left ankle, without other clinical signs. Initial tests: hemoglobin 11,7g/dL hematocrit 36.4{\%}, leukocyte count 17600/uL (7{\%} banded neutrophils, 70{\%} segmented neutrophils, 2{\%} eosinophils, basophils 1{\%}, 13{\%} lymphocytes, 7{\%} monocytes) C‐reactive protein 170,88mg/L. Joint ultrasound showed moderate effusion in the site. Patient was submitted to surgical procedure and S. multivorum was isolated from the effusion. The germ was susceptible to broad spectrum cephalosporins (ceftriaxone and cefepime) and fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin), and it was resistant to carbapenemic antibiotics and aminoglycosides. He was treated intravenously with oxacillin for 15 days and ceftriaxone for 13 days, and orally with ciprofloxacin for 15 days, with good outcome. Comments The Sphingobacterium multivorum is a gram negative bacillus that belongs to Flavobacteriaceae family and it is considered non‐pathogenic.

1361,YES,Bakour2015,Article,"AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and the mechanisms of carbapenem and colistin resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates in an Algerian hospital. RESULTS: Twelve isolates were collected between October 2013 and March 2014. All isolates were resistant to almost all antibiotics tested with a high-level resistance to imipenem (minimum inhibitory concentrations [MICs] {\textgreater}32 mg/L) with one strain showing resistance to colistin (MIC=16 mg/L). The results of the modified Hodge test and the modified Carba NP test were positive for all isolates. Besides, the activity of beta-lactamases was inhibited by EDTA in only two isolates. All the 12 isolates contained the naturally occurring blaOXA-51-like gene. Ten of them harbored the OXA beta-lactamases: blaOXA-23 (six isolates) and blaOXA-24 (four isolates) genes, while two isolates were positive for blaNDM-1 gene. The colistin-resistant isolate producing OXA-24 enzyme harbored a single mutation in the pmrB gene. Multilocus sequence typing demonstrated that the 12 isolates belonged to 2 clones: 10 to ST2 and 2 to ST85.

RESULTS: A 51-year-old man was referred with a 10-week history of ocular pain, photophobia, redness, and blurred vision. At his initial presentation, a corneal foreign body was removed and he was diagnosed with anterior uveitis, with commencement of topical corticosteroid therapy and ofloxacin. Despite treatment, he experienced ongoing foreign body sensation and glare. At presentation to our clinic, a central epithelial defect with multiple stromal infiltrates in a wreath pattern was identified and a diagnosis of infective keratitis was made. He was initially commenced on topical amikacin, oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and oral voriconazole. Corneal scraping confirmed Nocardia species. Microbiological culture revealed N. transvalensis as the causative organism, with resistance to several antibiotics, including amikacin. Clinically, there was only partial response of the keratitis to initial therapy. Treatment was changed to oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and topical ciprofloxacin, with eventual clinical improvement. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first reported case of N. transvalensis keratitis.

4047,MAYBE,Cmara2012,Article,"Objectives: The aim of this study was to characterize the first two extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant and multidrug-resistant (MDR) Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates collected from two sexually related patients (men who have sex with men) in Spain. Methods: Antimicrobial susceptibility was studied by Etest. Genes involved in quinolone, ceftriaxone and multidrug resistance were amplified by PCR and sequenced in both directions. The isolates were typed by N. gonorrhoeae multi-antigen sequence typing (NG-MAST). Results: The two isolates had the same MDR profile, showing resistance to penicillin (MIC 0.094 mg/L; $\beta$-lactamase negative), ceftriaxone (MIC 1.5 mg/L), cefixime (MIC 1.5 mg/L), cefotaxime (MIC 1 mg/L), ciprofloxacin (MIC {\textgreater}32 mg/L) and tetracycline (MIC 1.5 mg/L). NG-MAST showed that both isolates belonged to sequence type (ST) 1407 (porB-908 and tbpB-110). Ciprofloxacin resistance was due to amino acid substitutions in GyrA (S91F and D95G) and ParC (S87R). An A deletion in the promoter of the MtrCDE efflux pump (mtrR) was detected. No changes were detected in the pilQ gene. The outer membrane protein PorB showed two substitutions at G120K and A121N. An L421P substitution was observed in the PBP1A (ponA) sequence. The sequence of PBP2 (penA) showed a mosaic structure related to genotype XXXIV with a single additional amino acid substitution (A501P). This genotype was identical to a recently described French isolate (F89). Conclusions: This is the first reported case of high-level extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant N. gonorrhoeae transmission. The molecular typing and MDR genotype suggest possible European spread of this strain, highlighting the need for surveillance and the importance of testing the susceptibility of N. gonorrhoeae to extended-spectrum cephalosporins. {\textcopyright} The Author 2012.

21958,YES,VonThomsen2011,Article,"Introduction: Resistance to carbapenems in Gram-negative Bacteria is increasing worldwide. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistance can be mediated by production of metallo-$\alpha$-lactamases (MBL). MBLs are able to hydrolyse penicillins, cephalosporines, and even carbapenems, but not aztreonam. In Germany members of the Verona integron-encoded (VIM) family of MBLs have been reported most frequently. Here we report the detection of an IMP-13-type MBL (IMP for “active on imipenem”) in two clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa at a university hospital in northern Germany. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of IMP-13-producing organisms from clinical specimens in Germany. Case report: Two P. aeruginosa strains were isolated from clinical samples in February and March 2010, respectively. One Isolate was detected in the urine from a 70-year old male patient with a neurogenic disturbance of bladder and rectum. The patient was admitted to our hospital for surgical treatment of a sacral decubital ulcer. A second P. aeruginosa isolate was found in an inguinal wound swab from a 61-year old male patient who was admitted to hospital because of a type B dissection of the aorta. Both patients received multiple antibiotics before detection of the IMP-producing P. aeruginosa. More over, both patients developed Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea during their stay at hospital. Bacterial isolates were cultivated and identified by standard microbiological procedures. Susceptibility testing was done by the Vitek2 automated system. Production of MBL was confirmed by Etest and PCR from whole cell lysates. Amplified PCR-products were sequenced and analyzed using the BLAST algorithm. The MICs for both P. aeruginosa isolates were (isolate 1/isolate2, [≥g/ml]): piperacillin/tazobactam ≥ 128/≥128, ceftazidime ≥64/≥64, imipenem 8/≥16, meropenem 4/≥16. The production of an MBL was confirmed by Etest phenotypically. Sequencing of a 661 bp fragment (isolate 1) and a 622 bp fragment (isolate 2), respectively, revealed an IMP-13-type MBL in both isolates. Discussion: Although IMP-13 has been detected in isolates from other countries like Italy, Argentina or Austria, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of detection of IMP-13 in clinical isolates from Germany so far. This report underscores the sustaining spread of multidrug-resistant bacteria producing broad-spectrum beta-lactamases.

Emerging antimicrobial drug resistance among bacterial pathogens causing BSI can hinder optimal treatment and patient management decisions. In order to encourage the prudent use of appropriate antibiotics in our pediatric population at Children's Medical Center Hospital, Tehran, Iran, we studied the frequency and antibiogram patterns of blood culture isolates from January 2001 to December 2005. Of 25,223 blood cultures examined in this investigation, 2581 (10.23{\%}) were positive for bacterial growth. The frequency of gram-positive bacteria isolated was 47.5{\%} (1228 of 2581) and that for gram-negatives was 52.5{\%} (1353 of 2581). The rates of oxacillin (methicillin) resistance for S. aureus and coagulasenegative staphylococci (CoNS) were 86{\%} and 89{\%}, respectively. About 45{\%} of S. pneumoniae were resistant to trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole and approximately 73{\%} to penicillin. Among the gram-negative isolates, P. aeruginosa was most frequently isolated, representing 943 (36.7{\%}) over 5 years. In addition, this pathogen showed extremely high rates of antimicrobial resistance. There were notable differences in the sequence of the five most common organisms isolated from blood cultures, which can help set priorities for focused infection control efforts.

Preliminary in vitro studies have shown that H. pylori is highly susceptible to rifabutin. In this study resistance to rifabutin and its structurally related antibiotic, rifampin was assessed. Methods: One hundred H. pylori isolates from dyspeptic patients were recruited in this study. Bacterial suspensions (MacFarland No. 2) were surface inoculated on Brucella blood agar. Sterile blank disks were deposited on the surface of inoculated plates and 10 $\mu$L volume of rifabutin (0.06 $\mu$g/mL) and rifampin (4 $\mu$g/mL) was introduced into the blank disk. After 3-5 days of microaerobic incubation the inhibition zone diameters (IZDs) were recorded. Results: Among 100 isolates, 6 isolates exhibited IZDs {\textless}20 mm and considered resistant to rifabutin. Resistance to rifampin was found in 13 isolates. Rifabutin and rifampin were considerably effective on the susceptible strains which produced IZDs of 20-60 mm and 20-45 mm, respectively. Only one isolate was resistant to both antibiotics. There was no significant difference between resistance rates to rifabutin and rifampin (p value {\textgreater} 0.05). Discussion: Eradication of H. pylori infection is a primary goal in the management of H. pylori-related complications According to our finding, resistance of H. pylori isolates to rifabutin and rifampin is low, 6{\%} and 13{\%}, respectively.

This type of infection is usually fatal. Aeromonas infection is infrequently reported as the cause of ecthyma gangrenosum. Here we show the first case described in Italy of Aeromonas hydrophila ecthyma gangrenosum in the lower extremities in an immunocompetent diabetic without bacteraemia. A 63-year-old obese diabetic male was admitted with an ulcer on his left leg, oedema, pain and fever. Throughout his hospitalization blood cultures remained sterile, but a culture of A. hydrophila was isolated following punctures from typical leg pseudomonal-ecthyma gangrenosum lesions developed after admission. The patient, questioned again, stated that a few days before he had worked in a well near his house without taking precautions. We conclude that early diagnosis and suitable antibiotic therapy are important for the management of ecthyma gangrenosum. The typical presentation of soft tissue infection of A. hydrophila should mimic a Gram-positive infection, which may result in a delay in administration of appropriate antibiotics.

6029,YES,Ezeoke2013,Article,"Five nocardioform isolates from human clinical sources were evaluated. Analysis of the nearly full-length 16S rRNA gene showed 99.9-100 {\%} similarity among the strains. The results of a comparative phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that the isolates belonged to the genus Nocardia. Phenotypic and molecular analyses were performed on the clinical isolates. Traditional phenotypic analyses included morphological, biochemical/physiological, chemotaxonomic and antimicrobial susceptibility profiling. Molecular studies included 1441-bp 16S rRNA and 1246-bp gyrB gene sequence analyses, as well as DNA-DNA hybridizations. Biochemical analysis failed to differentiate the putative novel species from its phylogenetic neighbours; however, molecular studies were able to distinguish the patient strains and confirm them as members of a single species. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, similarity between the isolates and their closest relatives (type strains of Nocardia araoensis, N. arthritidis, N. beijingensis and N. niwae) was {\textless}/=99.3 {\%}. Analysis of partial gyrB gene sequences showed 98-99.7 {\%} relatedness among the isolates. Nocardia lijiangensis and N. xishanensis were the closest related species to the isolates based on gyrB gene sequence analysis, and their type strains showed 95.7 and 95.3 {\%} similarity, respectively, to strain W9988(T). Resistance to amikacin and molecular analyses, including DNA-DNA hybridization, distinguished the five patient strains from their phylogenetic neighbours, and the results of this polyphasic study indicated the existence of a novel species of Nocardia, for which we propose the name Nocardia amikacinitolerans sp. nov., with strain W9988(T) ( = DSM 45539(T) = CCUG 59655(T)) as the type strain.",I Ezeoke and H P Klenk and G Potter and P Schumann and B D Moser and B A Lasker and A Nicholson and J M Brown,1466-5026,Int J Syst Evol Microbiol,"*Drug Resistance, Bacterial,*Phylogeny,Amikacin/*pharmacology,Bacterial Typing Techniques,Base Composition,DNA, Bacterial/genetics,Fatty Acids/analysis,Genes, Bacterial,Humans,Molecular Sequence Data,Nocardia/*classification/drug effects/genetics/iso,Nucleic Acid Hybridization,Phospholipids/analysis,RNA, Ribosomal, 16S/genetics,Sequence Analysis, DNA,Vitamin K 2/analysis",1056--1061,"{Nocardia amikacinitolerans sp. nov., an amikacin-resistant human pathogen}",NA,63,2013,Pt 3,"1466-5034

521,YES,Ali2014,Article,"INTRODUCTION Acinetobacter baumannii is usually associated with respiratory tract, urinary tract and bloodstream infections. Recent reports suggest that it is increasingly causing skin and soft tissue infections. It is also evolving as a multidrug resistant organism that can be difficult to treat. We present a fatal case of multidrug resistant A. baumannii soft tissue infection and review of relevant literature. PRESENTATION OF CASE A 41 year old morbidly obese man, with history of alcoholic liver disease presented with left superficial pre-tibial abrasions and cellulitis caused by multidrug resistant (MDR) A. baumannii. In spite of early antibiotic administration he developed extensive myositis and fat necrosis requiring extensive and multiple surgical debridements. He deteriorated despite appropriate antibiotic therapy and multiple surgical interventions with development of multi-organ failure and died. DISCUSSION Managing Acinetobacter infections remains difficult due to the array of resistance and the pathogens ability to develop new and ongoing resistance. The early diagnosis of necrotizing soft tissue infection may be challenging, but the key to successful management of patients with necrotizing soft tissue infection are early recognition and complete surgical debridement. CONCLUSION A. baumannii is emerging as an important cause of severe, life-threatening soft tissue infections. Multidrug resistant A. baumannii soft tissue infections may carry a high mortality in spite of early and aggressive treatment. Clinicians need to consider appropriate early empirical antibiotic coverage or the use of combination therapy to include MDR A. baumannii as a cause of skin and soft tissue infections.

20713,YES,Thacker2014a,Article,"Background: Infection or colonization with multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) is associated with high mortality and morbidity. Knowledge of MDRO colonization may help in planning empirical antibiotic approach in neutropenic patients, which is known to improve patient outcomes. While routine cultures are positive and may help direct antibiotic therapy in only up to 15{\%} neutropenic patients, surveillance cultures are positive in more than 90{\%} of cancer patients. Aims: To assess the rate of MDRO carrier status at presentation and rate of conversion to MDRO during the treatment. Materials And Methods: Rectal swabs of all the outpatients presenting to pediatric oncology unit were sent within 7 days from date of registration from January 2014 to December 2014. Furthermore, stool cultures/rectal swabs of all patients who got directly admitted to the pediatric ward at presentation were sent within 24 h. Repeat rectal swabs were sent again for patients from this cohort when they got readmitted to the ward at least 15 days after last discharge or when clinically indicated. Results: Baseline surveillance rectal swabs were sent for 618 patients, which included 528 children with hematological malignancies and 90 children with solid tumors. Forty-five (7.3{\%}) showed no growth. Of the remaining 573, 197 (34.4{\%}) patients were colonized by two organisms and 30 (5.2{\%}) by three organisms. Three hundred and thirty-four (58.4{\%}) showed extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) Enterobacteriaceae, of which 165 (49.5{\%}) were ESBL sensitive to beta-lactam with beta-lactamase inhibitors combinations and 169 (50.5{\%}) were resistant to combinations. One hundred and sixteen (20.2{\%}) were carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and 65 (11.4{\%}) had vancomycin-resistant enterococci in baseline cultures. Only 63 (21{\%}) patients were colonized by a sensitive organism in their baseline surveillance cultures. Morbidity (Intensive Care Unit stay) and mortality was higher in patients colonized by MDR organisms. There was a significant correlation between the place of residence and CRE colonization status with the highest rate (60{\%}) of CRE colonization observed in children from East India. The repeat cultures showed the further conversion of sensitive isolates to MDRO in 80{\%} of these children, of which 40{\%} each converted from non-ESBL and non-CRE to ESBL and CRE, respectively. Conclusion: This is the first study illustrating the alarming high prevalence of community-acquired MDRO colonization, especially CRE, which has grave implications for therapy for children with cancer potentially compromising delivery of aggressive chemotherapy and affecting outcomes. This incidence further increases during the course of treatment. Knowing the baseline colonization also guides us for the planning of chemotherapy as well as antibiotic approach and infection control strategies. Local antibiotics stewardship including education of the healthcare workers as well as national level interventions to prevent antibiotic misuse in the community is critical to minimize this problem.",N Thacker and N Pereira and S D Banavali and G Narula and T Vora and G Chinnaswamy and M Prasad and R Kelkar and S Biswas and B Arora,"1998-4774

Here we report on the trends of R to penicillin (PEN) and macrolides (erythromycin, ERY) in Streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp), oxacillin (OXA) in Staphylococcus aureus (Sa), vancomycin (VAN) in Enterococcus faecalis (Efs) and E. faecium (Efm) as well as fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, CIP), 3rd generation cephalosporins (cefotaxime/ceftazidime, CTX/CAZ), piperacillin-tazobactam (P/T) and carbapenems (meropenem, MEM) in Escherichia coli (Ec), Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) among clinical isolates obtained from patients with healthcare-associated infections in Germany. Methods: Susceptibility data of isolates collected in 21, 20, 21, 22, 21 and 21 laboratories that participated in six surveillance studies conducted in 1995, 1998, 2001, 2004, 2007, and 2010, respectively, were analysed. MICs of antimicrobial agents were determined by the broth microdilution procedure according to the standard DIN EN ISO and interpreted by EUCAST criteria. Results: A total of 16,744 isolates primarily recovered from wounds (27{\%}), urine (21{\%}), respiratory specimens (20{\%}), and blood (9{\%}) were tested. There were 3,993 (24{\%}) ICU isolates, 10,387 (62{\%}) non-ICU isolates from hospitalised patients, 2,288 (14{\%}) isolates from outpatients, and 76 (0.04{\%}) isolates of unknown origin. Sp were included in 2001 for the first time. Reduced susceptibility to PEN and ERY among pneumococci was observed in 91.9{\%} and 84.6{\%} in 2001, 93.8{\%} and 78.9{\%} in 2004, 89.4{\%} and 84.5{\%} in 2007 and 84.3{\%} and 83.0{\%} in 2010, respectively, while the proportion of PEN-R strains was {\textless}1{\%} in all yrs. R to OXA in Sa steadily increased from 8{\%} in 1995 to 21.7{\%} in 2007, but then dropped to 17.9{\%} in 2010. R to VAN was rare ({\textless}0.5{\%}) in Efs, but increased in Efm from appr. 5{\%} (until 2001) to 12-15{\%} (after 2001). The proportion of Ec and Kp isolates with R to CTX, P/T and CIP increased from 1.2{\%}, 1.4{\%} and 6{\%} and 2.1{\%}, 2.1{\%} and 4.2{\%}, respectively, in 1995 to 18.2{\%}, 7.1{\%} and 33.1{\%}, and 17.9{\%}, 13{\%} and 19.1{\%}, respectively, in 2010. In contrast, R to MEM was lacking in Ec and also rare (max. 0.5{\%}) in Kp until 2007, but increased to 1.5{\%} in 2010. In Pa, the prevalence of R to CAZ, P/T, MEM, and CIP was 5.8{\%}, 7.7{\%}, 2.2{\%}, and 17.8{\%}, respectively, in 1995 compared to 17.1{\%}, 21{\%}, 10.5{\%}, and 21.5{\%}, respectively, in 2010. Conclusion: The data provide evidence that the occurrence of R to OXA in Sa (i.e. MRSA) and VAN in Efm seems to have stabilized, while increasing trends of R to important antimicrobial classes have been observed in major Gram-neg. pathogens. The emergence of R to carbapenems in Kp and Pa is alarming, potentially leading to a loss of this valuable treatment option.",M Kresken and B Körber-Irrgang and D Hafner,1438-4221,International Journal of Medical Microbiology,"Austria,Enterococcus faecalis,Escherichia coli,Germany,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Pseudomonas aeruginosa,Staphylococcus aureus,Streptococcus pneumoniae,Switzerland,antibiotic resistance,antiinfective agent,blood,broth dilution,carbapenem derivative,cephalosporin derivative,chemotherapy,ciprofloxacin,erythromycin,healthcare associated infection,hospital patient,human,hygiene,laboratory,macrolide,meropenem,microbiology,outpatient,oxacillin,pathogenesis,patient,penicillin G,piperacillin,prevalence,procedures,public health,quinolone derivative,society,tazobactam,urine,vancomycin,wound",136--137,"{Trends of antimicrobial resistance in major bacterial pathogens from healthcare-associated infections in Germany: Results of the antimicrobial resistance surveillance programme of the paul-ehrlich-society for chemotherapy, 1995-2010}",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L70938321 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmm.2012.08.002 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=14384221{\&}id=doi:10.1016{\%}2Fj.ijmm.2012.08.002{\&}atitle=Trends+of+ant,302,2012,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,YES,Erica,MAYBE,Allison,Allison,Mushtaq_2,no,cant find pdf,
13653,YES,Medell2014,Article,"INTRODUCTION: Enterococcus spp is currently considered as one of the most important nosocomial pathogens . The antibiotic resistance of this group of bacteria is a particularly important problem in health centers. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the antibiotic resistance of 50 Enterococcus spp strains isolated from hospitalized patients clinical samples. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional descriptive observational study in 50 clinical isolates of Enterococcus spp. Only one isolate per patient was analyzed . The identification and antibiotic susceptibility were studied by conventional and automated methods . The phenotypic analysis of glycopeptide resistance mechanisms was performed as recommended by the Spanish Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases . RESULTS: Of 50 isolates obtained from clinical samples, 30 ( 60.0{\%}) belonged to Enterococcus faecalis and 20 (40.0 {\%}) to Enterococcus faecium . The global resistance expressed by this genre was as follows: Ampicillin, 38/50 ( 76.0{\%}); high-level gentamicin, 33/50 ( 66.0{\%}); high-level streptomycin, 34/50 (68.0 {\%}) ; ciprofloxacin, 26/50 (52.0 {\%}); linezolid, 4/50 (8.0 {\%}); teicoplanin, 17/50 ( 34.0{\%}); vancomycin, 25/50 (50.0 {\%}); minocycline, 31/50 ( 62.0{\%}); tetracycline, 34/50 (68.0 {\%}); nitrofurantoin, 9/50 ( 18.0{\%}). As regards glycopeptides, 25/50 (50.0{\%}) showed a Van A mechanism and 10/50 (20.0 {\%}) a Van B mechanism . CONCLUSIONS: The isolates obtained at Hospital Hermanos Ameijeiras showed higher resistance rates than those reported in the consulted literature. The high percentage of vancomycin-resistant strains might have influenced the development of other Gram-positive bacteria resistant to this drug.

22197,MAYBE,Wang2011i,Article,"Objectives: To well understand the multilevel molecular characterization of extended-spectrum b-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae causing pneumonia. Methods: A total of 17 and 25 nonduplicate E.coli and K.pneumoniae isolated from 42 patients with pneumonia were characterized in a prospective study in eight hospitals located in seven geographical areas of China during April 2007 to May 2008. In-vitro susceptibilities of these isolates to 21 antimicrobial agents and the ESBL phenotype confirmation test as well as the genetic relationship between isolates were determined by standard method and multilocus sequence typing(MLST). blaESBL types and their genetic environment were analysed by PCR and sequencing. Applying southern blotting to locate blaESBL. Plasmids encoding blaESBL were also classified according to their incompatibility group by a PCR-based replicon-typing scheme. Results: MLST analysis showed the 42 isolates were genetically diverse, no predominant clone was identified. Fourteen strains of E.coli and fifteen strains of K. pneumoniae were confirmed as ESBL producers. The most dominant blaESBL was CTX-M-14(n = 14), followed by SHV-1, SHV-2, SHV- 11, CTX-M-15, CTX-M-65, CTXM-24, CTX-M-3, SHV-12, SHV-26, and SHV- 28.An IS element named ISEcp1, linkage with blaCTX-M-14 and blaCTX-M- 65 was detected in all strains carrying this blaESBL. It is noteworthy that ISEcp1, in one E.coli strain originated from patients with pneumonia coupled with systemic lupus erythematosus and herpes zoster from Jiangxi province was disrupted by IS10 at the middle of ISEcp1, but leaving intact promoter region, which is first found in China. In spite of identical promoter regions of blaCTX-M-14, the range of MICs to ceftazidime among those strains was significantly different, which suggested other mechanisms were involved in the different resistance levels. A truncated IS903 element was observed in six strains contained blaCTX-M-14. ISEcp1 has also been observed upstream of blaCTX-M-3. CTX-M-15 was characterized by the presence of RECF other than ISEcp1. In upstream of blaSHV the RECF which was preceded by IS26, ISEcp1 and other chromosome genes was detected. All the 13 blaSHV-producing strains were found a DEOR transcriptional regulator protein gene at downstream. Characterization of hybridization showed all the plasmids encoding CTX-M or SHV were similar in size except four strains which were also hybridized with larger or smaller plasmids. blaCTX-M were highly associated with IncFIB, IncX, IncI1, by contrast blaSHV were relevant to IncN,IncI1, IncX. Conclusion: The results reveal the high rate of blaESBL, predominantly blaCTX-M-14, located on different plasmids harboured by genotypically different E.coli and K.pneumoniae strains causing pneumonia. Gene arrangement in the blaCTX-M neighbourhood is highly conserved, but the genetic environment of blaSHV is diversity, which suggests complexity in dissemination of ESBL in E.coli and K.pneumoniae causing pneumonia, and further studies should be carried out.",X R Wang and J C Chen and Y Kang and Z C Gao,1323-7799,Respirology,"Asian,China,Escherichia coli,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Southern blotting,antiinfective agent,ceftazidime,clone,environment,extended spectrum beta lactamase,gene,herpes zoster,hospital,human,hybridization,in vitro study,molecular phylogeny,multilocus sequence typing,patient,penicillinase,phenotype,plasmid,pneumonia,promoter region,prospective study,regulator protein,replicon,society,systemic lupus erythematosus",58,{Molecular characterization of plasmid-mediated esbl and their genetic environment in escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from patients with pneumonia from china},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L70575903 http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1400-1843.2011.02071.x http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=13237799{\&}id=doi:10.1111{\%}2Fj.1400-1843.2011.02071.x{\&}atitle=M,16,2011,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,MAYBE,Allison,MAYBE,Brooke,Brooke,Mushtaq_2,no,cant find,

Both men denied further sexual activity. In the first case, treatment failure was confirmed, since the isolates before and after treatment were identical by auxotype, antibiogram, multilocus sequence type (MLST) and multi-antigen sequence type (NG-MAST). In the second case, the MLSTs before and after treatment were identical, but NG-MAST results were similar but not indistinguishable.

From the beginning of November 2001 to the end of October 2005, one hundred and four strains resistant to carbapenem antibiotics--imipenem and meropenem were cultured from clinical samples obtained from patients of the Infant Jesus Clinical Hospital Centre for Trauma Treatment in Warsaw and from patients of outpatient clinics.

Resistance to imipenem and meropenem was confirmed with a disc diffusion method. Production of metallo-beta-lactamases (MBL) was examined with the use of Etest MBL (AB Biodisk, Sweden), and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) by means of following procedures: DDST and / or DD (four variants) (Oxoid Ltd., England). MBL-positive strains (36) were cultured in cases of infections in adult patients (35 strains) and in a child (1 strain). Majority of strains belonged to the species P. aeruginosa (27), several strains - to the species P. putida (6) and remaining strains--to P. stutzeri, A. xylosoxidans, and E. cloacae (1 strain of each species). Four strains were producers of MBL-type and ESBL-type beta-lactamases. According to our knowledge and accessible literature described strains (except one paediatric strain) are the first MBL-positive strains isolated from adult hospitalized patients and adult ambulatory patients in Poland.

Methods: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by microdilution method according to CLSI guidelines. Resistance genes were characterized by PCR, DNA microarray (Check-points CT102) and sequencing. The genetic background of blaNDM-1 was analysed by PCR mapping. Transferability of beta-lactam resistance was tested by broth mating-out assays and transformation of plasmids. Typing of the Ab strain was performed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Results: A multidrug and carbapenem-resistant Ab isolate 11314 was recovered from a rectal swab specimen of a 20-year old patient in vegetative state transferred from Algeria to Belgium after severe traffic injury. The isolate was highly resistant to all beta-lactams including meropenem and imipenem (MIC ≥ 32 mg/L), aminoglycosides (gentamicin, tobramycin and amikacin), and quinolone (ciprofloxacin) but it remained susceptible to colistin (MIC = 0.5 mg/L), and tigecycline (MIC {\textless} 0.25 mg/L). PCR/sequencing and Check-points micro-array revealed the presence of blaNDM-1 only. A single not typeable plasmid of 174 kb was detected but transfer experiments failed to demonstrate the presence of any carbapenem-resistant trait, suggesting that the blaNDM-1 was located on the chromosome. PCR-mapping revealed that blaNDM-1 was located between two direct repeat of ISAba125 element in a transposon similar to the one reported in Ab 161/07 isolated in Germany (Pfeifer et al. JAC 2011; Accession Nr HQ857107). By MLST, Ab 11314 presented an allele profile 1-3-3-2-2-7-3 corresponding to sequence type (ST) 92 (Bartual et al., JCM 2005), a ST already described in many different regions of the world (mostly in association with OXA-23-producing Ab strains). Sequencing analysis of the intrinsic blaOXA-51-like and blaADC genes showed that this strain harboured the blaOXA-64 and the blaADC-26, neither of which were preceded by ISAba1 nor ISAba125. Conclusions: Here, we report for the first time an A. baumanniiproducing NDM-1 isolated in Belgium belonging to ST92.

Multiresistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter baumannii strains were isolated from a wound of a Canadian patient with a recent history of hospitalization in India. This resulted in the initiation of outbreak management that included surveillance cultures. Epidemiological and molecular investigations showed that NDM-1-producing K. pneumoniae ST16 and OXA-23-producing A. baumannii ST10 strains were transmitted to 5 other patients, resulting in the colonization of 4 patients and the death of 1 patient due to septic shock caused by the OXA-23-producing A. baumannii strain. The high rate of false positivity of the screening cultures resulted in additional workloads and increased costs for infection control and clinical laboratory work.

Sputa were obtained from three different categories of hospitals (district, regional and national) in Chad. All examined sputa were smear-positive and were investigated by culture and drug resistance testing for first-line antituberculosis drugs. From 232 sputa positive for acid-fast bacilli, 135 isolates of M. tuberculosis from different patients (46 women, 89 men, mean age 34 years) were analyzed. All the patients except one corresponded to new cases of tuberculosis. In total, 27 out of 135 isolates (20{\%}) were resistant to at least one major antituberculosis drug. Resistance to isoniazid was the most frequent resistance observed, with 18 isolates (13{\%}) presenting at least this resistance. Three isolates (2.2{\%}) were resistant to isoniazid and rifampicin (multidrug resistance MDR) including one isolate being concomitantly resistant to streptomycin and ethambutol. The resistance rate differed in relation to the category of the hospital; the most important resistance rate was observed in regional hospitals (33{\%}), while it was 16{\%} and 14{\%} in the national and district hospitals, respectively. HIV serology was performed in 81 patients, among whom 20 (25{\%}) were positive. This is the first study that shows that drug resistance of M. tuberculosis is present in Chad. Besides single drug-resistant isolates, multidrug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis could also be identified.

22035,MAYBE,Wahid2013,Article,"Background: Shigellosis is a significant public health concern and is one of the major diarrhoeal diseases in developed and developing countries including Bangladesh. Although shigellosis is generally self-limiting, patients with diarrhea frequently receive empiric ciprofloxacin treatment. We report here the serogroup distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of Shigella isolated from rural and urban areas of Bangladesh. Methods: Stool samples were collected from patients attending treatment centers of icddr,b during January 2010 to December 2012 and processed by standard methods. Shigella spp. were isolated and characterized using standard microbiological and molecular methods. Antibiotic susceptibility patter was done by disc-diffusion using the CLSI guidelines. Results: In total, 1912 (19.05{\%}) isolates were confirmed as Shigella spp. from 10,036 diarrhoeal patients in Dhaka and 478 (10.58{\%}) isolates from 4,516 patients in Mirzapur, Bangladesh. S. flexneri was the predominant in both Dhaka (47.75{\%}) and Mirzapur (50.21{\%}). S. sonnei was the second predominant serogroup and the prevalence was 25.36{\%} and 32.01{\%} in Dhaka and Mirzapur, respectively, followed by S. boydii (19.29{\%} and 14.65{\%}, respectively) and S. dysenteriae (4.65{\%} and 3.01{\%}, respectively). Only 3{\%} of strains isolated in Dhaka did not agglutinate with any commercially available anitisera but showed Shigella like biochemical reactions which are termed as Shigella-like organisms. Of the isolates, 5.87{\%} of the strains showed resistance to mecillinam irrespective of their resistance to ampicillin, co-trimoxazole, nalidixic acid, species, and location, and resistance to ciprofloxacin was 70{\%} and 35{\%} in Dhaka and Mirzapur, respectively. Resistance to ≥3 drugs was found in more than 90{\%} of the strains in both locations. The emergence of ciprofloxacin resistance was first detected in S. dysenteriae in 2003 and in S. flexneri and S. boydii were in 2007 and in 2008, respectively. Since its emergence, ciprofloxacin- resistant strains are rapidly increasing and spread out among Shigella species, commonly among S. sonnei and S. flexneri. The rapid increase of resistance may be due to indiscriminate use of antibiotics and mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer have also contributed a lot to the emergence and diffusion of multi-drug resistance in Shigella spp. Conclusions: Emergence of ciprofloxacin resistant Shigella species in both rural and urban areas of Bangladesh is disturbing as treatment options in our geographic area and is alarming and likely to emerge as a threat to public health.

This study was undertaken to identify and characterise mutations in the gyrA and parC genes of N. gonorrhoeae resistant to six different quinolone antibiotics. In total, 64 N. gonorrhoeae clinical isolates were obtained during 2007-2009 from patients attending sexually transmitted diseases clinics (New Delhi, 35; Pune, 16; Mumbai, 6; Hyderabad, 6; and Nagpur, 1). Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by Etest and mutation patterns in gyrA and parC were determined by sequencing analysis. All strains showed varying resistance to different quinolone analogues, ranging from 17.2{\%} (gatifloxacin) to 98.4{\%} (ofloxacin and norfloxacin). Sequencing of gyrA and parC revealed that 100{\%} of strains showed mutations in gyrA and 46.9{\%} showed mutations both in gyrA and parC. All strains showed single or double mutations at Ser-91--{\textgreater}Phe, Ser-91--{\textgreater}Thr and Asp-95--{\textgreater}Gly/Asn in gyrA and at Glu-91--{\textgreater}Gly in parC. Asp-95--{\textgreater}Asn mutation was the most prevalent in strains isolated from New Delhi, whilst Asp-95--{\textgreater}Gly was prevalent in strains isolated from Pune. Strains were categorised into eight different mutation patterns. Resistant strains with high minimum inhibitory concentrations ({\textgreater}/=8 mug/mL) showed mutations both in gyrA and parC. The difference in the proportion of strains showing mutations in gyrA and parC was found to be significant (P{\textless}0.001). The mutation Asp-95--{\textgreater}Asn was restricted to Pune strains only.

12287,MAYBE,Liu2011e,Article,"Aim To monitor the resistance to metronidazole, clarithromycin, Levofl oxacin, furazolidone and amoxicillin of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) strains in Jiangxi Province. Method The tissue samples were collected by gastroscope biopsy from the outpatients and inpatients with gastric diseases. 121 tissue samples cultured in microaerobic condition were identified as typical H. pylori strains by biochemical and slice checking methods. E-test method was used to measure the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of these identified H. pylori strains resistant to metronidazole, clarithromycin, Levofloxacin and amoxicillin. Drug sensitivity tests of furazolidone was performed by means of Kirby-Bane. Result Among 121 H. pylori strains, the resistance rate to metronidazole was 72.70{\%} (88/121), and the MIC ranged from 0.016 mg/L to beyond 256 mg/L; to clarithromycin, 14.88{\%} (18/121), MIC ranged from 0.016 mg/L to beyond 256 mg/L; to Levofloxacin, 14.05{\%} (17/121), MIC from 0.02 mg/L to beyond 256 mg/L; amoxicillin 0.83{\%} (1/121), MIC from 0.016 mg/L to 2 mg/L; furazolidone 0{\%} (0/121) Conclusion In Jiangxi Province, the resistance rate of H. pylori to metronidazole was the highest (72.70{\%}), and the second was to clarithromycin and Levofloxacin (14.88{\%}, 14.05{\%} respectively).

16225,YES,Pearman2006,Article,"The first hospital outbreak of a vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) in Western Australia (WA) started in the Royal Perth Hospital in July 2001 and initially involved the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and the Nephrology and Dialysis Units. The outbreak was caused by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) of the vanB genotype. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and plasmid analysis of the isolates demonstrated a single-strain outbreak. Despite the isolation of carriers and implementation of all the additional precautions recommended to control VRE, VREF spread rapidly. Two months after the index patient was detected, the epidemic strain had spread to 22 wards and units and one outpatient unit (Satellite Dialysis). Four patients were infected and 64 were colonized. A Hospital VRE Executive Group, which included the Chief Executive and Directors of Clinical Services and Nursing, was formed to eradicate the outbreak and to prevent the epidemic strain from becoming endemic in the hospital. The WA Department of Health agreed to provide substantial extra funding to enable the hospital to use expensive enhanced infection control practices, as follows.1.Cohorting of all positive and ward contact patients in separate wards with dedicated nursing staff for each cohort.2.All inpatients (ward contacts without known exposure) were screened during a one-week period to identify the total reservoir of VREF carriage. Thirty-nine previously unknown carriers were found.3.Establishment of a dedicated VRE ward-cleaning service for the duration of the outbreak.4.Environmental cultures after terminal cleaning and disinfection to check the efficacy of terminal cleaning after carriers had been discharged.5.Electronic flagging of the medical records of VREF carriers and ward contacts.6.Screening of ward contacts after discharge from hospital.7.Special arrangements for the discharge of geriatric VREF carriers and ward contacts to residential care facilities. Control was handicapped by the slowness of conventional laboratory methods, which took four to five days to identify VRE and allowed environmental contamination and nosocomial transmission to occur before carriers were detected and isolated. A laboratory procedure to make rapid provisional identification of VRE within 30-48 h was developed by performing multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for vanA and vanB genes directly on 24-h selective enrichment broth cultures. On average, four rectal swabs, each collected on separate days, were needed to detect {\textgreater}90{\%} of carriers. In total, 1977 ward contacts were screened after discharge from hospital and 54 (2.73{\%}) were found to be carrying VREF. The electronic labelling and active follow-up of ward contacts resulted in a significant number of carriers being detected who otherwise posed a risk of initiating further outbreaks in hospital if they were re-admitted. The outbreak was terminated after five months and the cost of the enhanced infection control practices was AUD{\$} 2 700 000 ({\pounds}1 000 000). Ongoing control has been facilitated by targeted active surveillance cultures: on admission to high-risk units (ICU, Burns, Nephrology, Haematology, Bone Marrow Transplant Unit), on transfer out of the ICU to other hospital units, by monthly screening of patients regularly attending Dialysis Units, and by opportunistic laboratory screening of inpatient faecal specimens submitted for Clostridium difficile culture and toxin. Vigilance needs to be maintained as the epidemic strain of VREF remains in the Perth community. Ward contacts of the first outbreak have caused small outbreaks in two hospitals, and seven to 19 sporadic new carriers have been detected annually since the first outbreak. The key elements of the VRE control programme are as follows:1.Targeted active surveillance cultures of patients on high-risk hospital units.2.Rapid provisional laboratory identification of VRE by multiplex PCR directly on 24-h selective enrichment broth cultures.3.Contact isolation of known carriers and unscreened ward contacts of outbreaks.4.Electronic flaggi g of medical records of known carriers and unscreened ward contacts of outbreaks.5.Eradication of single-strain (epidemic strain) outbreaks in hospitals by enhanced infection control practices.6.Surveillance typing of VRE isolates from all new carriers in WA to identify epidemic strains and trace their epidemiology.

19120,MAYBE,Shibl2013a,Article,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the emergence of NDM-, OXA-48-, and VIM-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: From June to December 2011, we obtained K. pneumoniae isolates with reduced sensitivity to carbapenem identified in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Only non-duplicate clinical and surveillance isolates obtained from inpatients were included. PCR amplification was carried out for the detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase genes (blaCTX-M, blaTEM, blaSHV) and carbapenemase genes (blaKPC, blaVIM, blaIMP, blaNDM, and blaOXA-48). Susceptibility to imipenem, meropenem, amikacin, gentamicin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and colistin was determined. RESULTS: Of the 60K. pneumoniae isolates studied, 45 were from patients in the intensive care unit. Forty-seven isolates harbored blaOXA-48, 12 were positive for blaNDM, and one for blaVIM. No isolate harbored a combination of these resistance genes. No isolate harbored blaKPC or blaIMP. All 37 blaCTX-M-positive isolates belonged to CTX-M group 1, and 29 were positive for a combination of blaCTX-M and blaOXA-48. blaTEM and blaSHV genes were found in 17 and 39 isolates, respectively. All isolates were imipenem- and meropenem-resistant, with a high rate of co-resistance to the other antibiotics. Three blaOXA-48-positive isolates with colistin resistance were detected.

21988,YES,Vu-Thien2010,Article,"Background. Staphylococcus aureus infection in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) is frequent and may be due to colonization by a few pathogenic lineages. Systematic genotyping of all isolates, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) as well as methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is necessary to identify such lineages and follow their evolution in patients. Multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA/VNTR) was used to survey S. aureus clinical isolates in a French paediatric CF centre. Results. During a 30 months period, 108 patients, aged 2 to 21 years, regularly followed up at the centre, provided sputum for culture. From 79 patients, a total of 278 isolates were genotyped by MLVA, resolving into 110 genotypes and 19 clonal complexes (CC) composed of similar or closely related isolates. 71{\%} of the strains were distributed into four main CCs, in term of number of isolates and number of genotypes. Spa (Staphylococcus protein A) typing was performed on representative samples, showing an excellent concordance with MLVA. In 17 patients, strains from two to four different CCs were recovered over time. On six occasions, S. aureus isolates with the same genotype were shared by 2 different patients and they belonged to one of the four main clusters. Methicillin-resistance was observed in 60{\%} of the isolates, 90{\%} of which belonged to the main clonal complexes CC8, CC45 and CC5. In 5 patients, methicillin-resistance of S. aureus isolates was not associated with the mecA gene: for four patients, it was due to overproduction of -lactamase, leading to BOR-SA (borderline S. aureus) isolates, while a strain showing probably a new modified penicillin-binding capacity (MOD-SA) was observed from one patient. Conclusion. Systematic genotyping of S. aureus isolates recovered from sputum of CF children allows a thorough analysis of the strains responsible for sporadic as well as chronic colonization and the follow up of their evolution over time. We show here that more than 70{\%} of these strains belong to 4 major CCs. MSSA as well as MRSA, BOR-SA and MOD-SA isolates can persist over several years, despite antibiotic treatments. {\textcopyright} 2010 Vu-Thien et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",H Vu-Thien and K Hormigos and G Corbineau and B Fauroux and H Corvol and D Moissenet and G Vergnaud and C Pourcel,1471-2180,BMC Microbiol,",Adolescent,Bacterial Typing Techniques,Bacterial/genetics,Child,Cluster Analysis,Cystic Fibrosis/*microbiology,DNA,France,Genotype,Humans,Infant,Longitudinal Studies,Minisatellite Repeats,Preschool,Staphylococcal Infections/*microbiology,Staphylococcus aureus,Staphylococcus aureus/classification/*genetics/iso,Young Adult,adolescent,adult,article,bacterial strain,bacterium isolate,beta lactamase,child,clonal variation,cystic fibrosis,enzyme synthesis,gene cluster,gene locus,genotype,health survey,human,longitudinal study,major clinical study,methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus,meticillin,multiple locus variable number tandem repeat analy,pediatric hospital,penicillin binding protein,penicillin binding protein 2a,penicillin resistance,preschool child,school child,sputum culture,staphylococcus protein A,tandem repeat",24,{Longitudinal survey of Staphylococcus aureus in cystic fibrosis patients using a multiple-locus variable-number of tandem-repeats analysis method},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L358348440 http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2180-10-24 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=14712180{\&}id=doi:10.1186{\%}2F1471-2180-10-24{\&}atitle=Longitudinal+surve,10,2010,NA,"From Duplicate 1 (Longitudinal survey of Staphylococcus aureus in cystic fibrosis patients using a multiple-locus variable-number of tandem-repeats analysis method - Vu-Thien, H; Hormigos, K; Corbineau, G; Fauroux, B; Corvol, H; Moissenet, D; Vergnaud, G; Pourcel, C)

9508,MAYBE,Jain2014a,Article,"Objectives: Gram-negative bacteria with diverse carbapenemases, including New Delhi metallo-$\beta$-lactamase (NDM) enzymes, have been increasingly recorded in the UK since 2007. We analysed patient data for NDM-positive isolates confirmed by the national reference laboratory from UK laboratories from February 2008 to July 2013. Methods: Isolates resistant to carbapenems and with imipenem MICs reduced ≥8-fold by EDTA were tested by PCR for genes encoding acquired class B carbapenemases. MICs were determined by BSAC agar dilution methodology. When requested by the sender, or when they were members of apparent clusters, NDM-positive isolates were typed by variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) analysis or PFGE. Data provided by the sending laboratories were collated and reviewed. Results: From February 2008 to July 2013 the reference laboratory confirmed 326 NDM-positive isolates from 250 patients, submitted by 83 laboratories. Most (85{\%}, 213/250) patients were already hospitalized when the NDM-positive bacteria were detected, were male (61{\%}, 152/250) and were aged {\textgreater}60 years (58{\%}, 145/250). Travel history was available for only 40{\%} of patients, but 52{\%} (53/101) of these had documented healthcare contact within or travel to the Indian subcontinent. Most NDM-positive isolates (94{\%}, 306/326) were Enterobacteriaceae with just 6{\%} (20/326) non-fermenters; the predominant hosts were Klebsiella spp. (55{\%}, 180/326) and Escherichia coli (25{\%}, 80/326). Almost all NDM-positive isolates were resistant to multiple antibiotic classes, but 90{\%} remained susceptible to colistin. Conclusions: Gram-negative bacteria with NDM carbapenemases are a growing challenge, especially for elderly hospitalized patients, including those with healthcare contact in the Indian subcontinent, and leave few therapeutic options. UK outbreaks remain rare and contained. {\textcopyright} 2014.",A Jain and K L Hopkins and J Turton and M Doumith and R Hill and R Loy and D Meunier and R Pike and D M Livermore and N Woodford,"1460-2091
