491,MAYBE,Alenton2013,Article,"Introduction: Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) are an emerging global threat. Most outbreaks have been NDM-1 or KPC. We describe an outbreak of OXA-181-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae in a 275 bedded acute general hospital in Singapore. Methods: A patient who was managed in a 24 bedded, Male, Geriatric, Transition {\&} Rehabilitation unit had a blood culture positive for Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to Imipenem and Meropenem (MIC 6.000mg/L and 24.000mg/L ) on 24 January 2013. Contact tracing with rectal swabs was done for all patients in the same cubicle and then ward. The ward and adjacent gym were closed, CRE patients were isolated in single rooms, patient areas and bathroom facilities were cleaned and disinfected. Hand hygiene and isolation education were reinforced to all healthcare staff. All patients were swabbed during outpatient follow up and during readmission. The unit was reopened after 12 days when no new cases of CRE were identified from remaining patient contacts. All positive CRE isolates were sent to a reference laboratory for further typing. Results: Two of five (40{\%}) patients who had stayed in the same 6- bedded cubicle as the index case were found to have CRE. Three of 9 (33{\%}) of the rest of the ward patients were CRE positive. A further two contacts had CRE detected in urine specimens 4 days and a week later. Overall, the attack rate for patients in the same cubicle was 3/6 (50{\%}) and ward was 3/9 (33{\%}). A screen of the adjacent ward did not identify any CRE patients among 18 screened. All isolates were identical by Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis bearing blaOXA-181. Conclusion: This strain of OXA-181-producing Klebsiella pneumonia has clear outbreak potential. Prompt action with strong multidisciplinary support and the ability to close the affected ward enabled us to contain this outbreak.

512,MAYBE,Alghoribi2015,Article,"OBJECTIVES: We investigated the molecular epidemiology of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) from a tertiary care hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, revealing, for the first time, the population structure of UPEC in the region. METHODS: A total of 202 UPEC isolates were recovered from hospital and community patients with urinary tract infection in December 2012 and January 2013. Strains were characterized by MLST, antibiotic susceptibility determination and virulence gene detection. RESULTS: The most common lineages were ST131 (17.3{\%}), ST73 (11.4{\%}), ST38 (7.4{\%}), ST69 (7.4{\%}), ST10 (6.4{\%}), ST127 (5.9{\%}), ST95 (5.4{\%}), ST12 (3.5{\%}), ST998 (3.5{\%}) and ST405 (3{\%}). ST131 and ST405 isolates were significantly associated with high levels of antibiotic resistance (60{\%} of ST131 carried CTX-M-14 or CTX-M-15 and 66.7{\%} of ST405 isolates carried CTX-M-15). ST131, CTX-M-15-positive isolates were predominantly of the fimH30/clade C group, resistant to fluoroquinolones; members of this sub-group were more likely to carry a high number of genes encoding selected virulence determinants. The relatively high proportion of ST38 was notable and four of these isolates harboured aggR. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the presence of MDR, CTX-M-positive ST38, ST131 and ST405 UPEC in Saudi Arabia. The high proportion of isolates with CTX-M is a particular concern.

Methods: A 37-year-old woman was hospitalised in May of 2009 for an open fracture grade III of the right tibial pilon. External fixator were placed and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin (SARM) were isolated from the wound. The patient got better and two months later, the patient was discharged with a treatment consisting on levofloxacin+rifampin due to a new isolation of SARM in the wound. In March of 2010, the patient returned to the hospital with an acute clinical pictures of suppuration through an ankle fistula. A surgery resection of the distal end of the tibia, affected by osteomyelitis, was done. The wound and surgical bone tissue specimens were processed. Results: Gram-negative bacillus was isolated from both, wound exudates and bone samples. The isolate was identified as A. hydrophila by both phenotypic and genotyopic methods. The isolate showed resistance to ampicillin, cefazolin, cefotaxime, cefepime, gentamicin, tobramycin and ciprofloxacin; decreased susceptibility to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ceftazidime and aztreonam; and susceptibility to cotrimoxazole, amikacin, piperacillin/tazobactam and carbapenems. Clavulanic acid recovered the activity of cefotaxime and ceftazidime. The patient was successfully treated with meropenem+amikacin. Standard PCR conditions were used to amplify the genes blaTEM, blaSHV, blaCTX-M and blaOXA; sequence analysis of PCR products obtained identified TEM-1 and CTX-M-15 ESBL, no PCR products were obtained using the remaining primers. This isolate had also the aac(6′)-Ib-cr and the aac(3)-IIa aminoglycoside resistance genes. Conclusions: 1. We present the first known case of osteomyelitis associated to a CTXM- 15-producing A. hydrophila isolate carrying also the blaTEM-1 gene, as well as genes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides, aac(3)-IIa, and to aminoglycosides and ciprofloxacin, aac(6′)-Ib-cr. 2.

Methods: The outbreak occured during the period 15 to 29 March,2005. A newborn infected with S. typhimurium was defined as a case. Newborns who were hospitalized during the outbreak period with no diagnosis of S. typhimurium infections (n=50) constituted the control group I (CG I). The matched patients of the control group II (CG II) (n=20) were selected from neonates without S. typhimurium infections during the period. Results: Of 22 infants who were affected two died. Cases developed diarrhea (n=20), septicemia (n=5) and meningtis (n=1). The strain was resistant to ampicillin, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, amikacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxasole and chloromphenicol, susceptible to meropenem. All of the infected neonates were treated with meropenem. The surveillance cultures were negative. The outbreak was controlled by approprite therapy and institution of effective control measures. The cases were more exposed to mechanical ventilation than CG I (p{\textless}0.05).

Multivariate regression analysis indicated that obesity (OR= 7.98; p= 0.013), central venous catheterization (OR= 6.65; p= 0.005), nasogastric tube (OR= 16.58; p{\textless} 0.001) and use of H2 receptor blockers (OR= 4.41; p= 0.010) were independent risk factors. The number of patient given at least one antibiotic (92 in case group, 51 in control group) was statistically higher than those who were not (48 in case group, 7 in control group) (OR= 14.86; p{\textless} 0.001). Use of antibiotics [ampicillin-sulbactam and/or amoxicillin-clavulanate, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, piperacillin-tazobactam (TZP), meropenem (MEM), imipenem (IPM), vancomycin (VAN), cephalosporins and teicoplanin (TEC)] were found to be statistically significantly higher in the case group by univariate analysis (p{\textless} 0.05). In multivariate analysis, it was determined that TZP (OR= 6.82; p{\textless} 0.001), IPM (OR= 3.97; p= 0.023) and VAN (OR= 8.46; p= 0.001) use were independent risk factors in MRSA bacteremia. The duration of MEM (p= 0.037) and cephalosporin use (p{\textless} 0.001) were significantly longer in the case group, however there was no statistically significant difference between the duration of use of other antibiotics (p{\textgreater} 0.05). All MRSA isolates were mecA gene positive (n= 99), the resistance rates for ciprofloxacin, rifampin, gentamicin, tetracyclin, cefoxitin, erythromycin and clindamycin were 95{\%}, 95{\%}, 94{\%}, 96{\%}, 98{\%}, 71{\%} and 36{\%}, respectively. All of the isolates were found to be susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, VAN, TEC, tigecycline, linezolid and daptomycin. Mortality rates in patients who were infected with MRSA strains exhibiting vancomycin MIC value of {\textless}/= 1.0 microg/ml (n= 49) and with MRSA strains exhibiting MIC {\textgreater} 1.0 microg/ml (n= 50) were 34.6{\%} (17/49) and 60{\%} (30/50), respectively. This difference was found to be statistically significant (p= 0.012). Thus it was concluded that the mortality rate increased in patients infected with MRSA with high ({\textgreater} 1.0 microg/ml) vancomycin MIC value. The results of this study indicated that obesity, presence of central venous catheter and nasogastric tube, and the use of H2 receptor blockers, IPM, TZP and VAN were independent risk factors for MRSA bacteremia. This was the first study showing the relationship between increasing mortality and high vancomycin MIC values in MRSA bacteremia in Turkey.",O Atmaca and P Zarakolu and C Karahan and B Cakir and S Unal,"0374-9096 (Print)

1165,MAYBE,Aung2015,Article,"BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the most serious health problems in Myanmar. Because TB drug resistance is associated with genetic mutation(s) relevant to responses to each drug, genotypic methods for detecting these mutations have been proposed to overcome the limitations of classic phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST). We explored the current estimates of drug-resistant TB and evaluated the usefulness of genotypic DST in Myanmar. METHODS: We determined the drug susceptibility of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated from sputum smear-positive patients with newly diagnosed pulmonary TB at two main TB centers in Myanmar during 2013 by using conventional phenotypic DST and the GenoType MTBDRplus assay (Hain Lifescience, Germany). Discrepant results were confirmed by sequencing the genes relevant to each type of resistance (rpoB for rifampicin; katG and inhA for isoniazid). RESULTS: Of 191 isolates, phenotypic DST showed that 27.7{\%} (n=53) were resistant to at least one first-line drug and 20.9{\%} (n=40) were resistant to two or more, including 18.3{\%} (n=35) multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) strains. Monoresistant strains accounted for 6.8{\%} (n=13) of the samples. Genotypic assay of 189 isolates showed 17.5{\%} (n=33) MDR-TB and 5.3{\%} (n=10) isoniazid-monoresistant strains. Genotypic susceptibility results were 99.5{\%} (n=188) concordant and agreed almost perfectly with phenotypic DST (kappa=0.99; 95{\%} confidence interval 0.96-1.01).

1354,YES,Baker2015,Article,"BACKGROUND: Shigellosis is an acute, severe bacterial colitis that, in high-income countries, is typically associated with travel to high-risk regions (Africa, Asia, and Latin America). Since the 1970s, shigellosis has also been reported as a sexually transmitted infection in men who have sex with men (MSM), in whom transmission is an important component of shigellosis epidemiology in high-income nations. We aimed to use sophisticated subtyping and international sampling to determine factors driving shigellosis emergence in MSM linked to an outbreak in the UK. METHODS: We did a large-scale, cross-sectional genomic epidemiological study of shigellosis cases collected from 29 countries between December, 1995, and June 8, 2014. Focusing on an ongoing epidemic in the UK, we collected and whole-genome sequenced clinical isolates of Shigella flexneri serotype 3a from high-risk and low-risk regions, including cases associated with travel and sex between men. We examined relationships between geographical, demographic, and clinical patient data with the isolate antimicrobial susceptibility, genetic data, and inferred evolutionary relationships. FINDINGS: We obtained 331 clinical isolates of S flexneri serotype 3a, including 275 from low-risk regions (44 from individuals who travelled to high-risk regions), 52 from high-risk regions, and four outgroup samples (ie, closely related, but genetically distinct isolates used to determine the root of the phylogenetic tree). We identified a recently emerged lineage of S flexneri 3a that has spread intercontinentally in less than 20 years throughout regions traditionally at low risk for shigellosis via sexual transmission in MSM. The lineage had acquired multiple antimicrobial resistance determinants, and prevailing sublineages were strongly associated with resistance to the macrolide azithromycin. Eight (4{\%}) of 206 isolates from the MSM-associated lineage were obtained from patients who had previously provided an isolate; these serial isolations indicated atypical infection patterns (eg, reinfection). INTERPRETATION: We identified transmission-facilitating behaviours and atypical course(s) of infection as precipitating factors in shigellosis-affected MSM. The intercontinental spread of antimicrobial-resistant shigella through established transmission routes emphasises the need for new approaches to tackle the public health challenge of sexually transmitted infections in MSM.

1362,YES,Bakour2014a,Article,"PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to characterize the molecular support of resistance to carbapenems, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones in carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates recovered between January 2011 and April 2013 from Algerian hospitals. METHODS: Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed using disk diffusion and Etest methods. Carbapenemase activity was detected using both MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry assay and via microbiological tests. Carbapenem, aminoglycoside and fluoroquinolone resistance determinants were studied by PCR and sequencing. Clonal relationships between strains were determined using Multi Locus Sequence Typing (MLST). RESULTS: A total of 47 imipenem-resistant A. baumannii were isolated and identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. All imipenem-resistant strains were positive in the modified Hodge test, and EDTA inhibited the activity of metallo-beta-lactamases enzymes in 11 strains. The blaOXA-23 gene was detected in 33 strains and the blaOXA-24 gene in 10 strains. The metallo-beta-lactamase blaNDM-1 gene was detected in 11 isolates (23.4{\%}) from Algiers and Setif, including 7 that co-expressed a blaOXA-23 gene. Resistance to aminoglycosides was due to the production of aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes, AAC(3)-Ia, AADA, ANT(2'')-I, APH(3')-VI, and 16S rRNA methylases, ArmA. The fluoroquinolone resistance was mainly associated with mutations at Ser83Leu and Ser80Leu of the gyrA and parC genes, respectively. MLST revealed five sequence types (STs), 1, 2, 19, 25, and 85. The imipenem-resistant A. baumannii ST2 was the predominant clone (35/47).

However , emergence of multidrug resistance has made the selection of antimicrobials complicated. Resistance to fluo-roquinolones has been in rise especially in Asia. Objective: Present study was undertaken to de-termine any change in isolation and serotype switching of Shigella and monitor their antimi-crobial resistance over a 5 year period( 2006-2011) .and compare with our previous study .( 2001-2006). A total of 2100 faecal samples from patients with diarrhea were processed ( 2006- 2011). Isolates identified by standard microbiological techniques as Shigella spp .Disk diffusion meth-od for antimicrobial susceptibility performed using CLSI guidelines. Of the 2100 samples , 77(3.66{\%}) were Shigella spp. Further predominance of Shigella flexnerii was noted over the other serogroups . 3 out of 77 Shigella were S sonnei and one S dysen-triae1. 100{\%} resistance was noted against Nali-dixic acid and significant increase in resistance seen with Ampicillin(100{\%}),,Co-trimoxazole( 89.6{\%}), Tetracycline( 84.4{\%}), Ciprofloxacin( 87{\%})and Norfloxacin ( 83.1{\%}). Decrease in re-sistance noted against aminoglycosides. Howev-er Shigellae were susceptible to third generation cephalosporins. Isolation of Shigella species in our study was less (3.66{\%}) in comparision to previous study ( 2001-2006) (5.7{\%}) . Shigella flexneri was the predominant serogroup (94.8{\%}) and Shigella flexneri 2a the frequently isolated in our study .This was in synchrony with our previous study and studies elsewhere. Two isolates were re-sistant to cephalosporins and this is an alarm ,signaling the emergence of cephalosporin resis-tance in this region of the country. Antibiotic treatment is recommended for shigello-sis as it reduces the duration,severity ,excretion of organisms and prevents lethal complications.

Invasive NTS is now being established as having a new and emerging pathogenic role. There is not sufficient data on the prevalence of NTS serovars and their antibiotic susceptibility pattern from India. Faecal specimens collected from patients with acute gastroenteritis were processed to isolate Salmonella according to the standard protocol for a period from January 2011–December 2014. Salmonella isolates were serotyped and tested for antibiotic susceptibility. Of the total 320 (10.04{\%}) bacterial enteric pathogens isolated, 64 (20{\%}) were non-typhoidal Salmonella.

2667,MAYBE,Brooke2012,Article,"Summary: Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is an emerging multidrug-resistant global opportunistic pathogen. The increasing incidence of nosocomial and community-acquired S. maltophilia infections is of particular concern for immunocompromised individuals, as this bacterial pathogen is associated with a significant fatality/case ratio. S. maltophilia is an environmental bacterium found in aqueous habitats, including plant rhizospheres, animals, foods, and water sources. Infections of S. maltophilia can occur in a range of organs and tissues; the organism is commonly found in respiratory tract infections. This review summarizes the current literature and presents S. maltophilia as an organism with various molecular mechanisms used for colonization and infection. S. maltophilia can be recovered from polymicrobial infections, most notably from the respiratory tract of cystic fibrosis patients, as a cocolonizer with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Recent evidence of cell-cell communication between these pathogens has implications for the development of novel pharmacological therapies. Animal models of S. maltophilia infection have provided useful information about the type of host immune response induced by this opportunistic pathogen. Current and emerging treatments for patients infected with S. maltophilia are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2012, American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved.",J S Brooke,"0893-8512

2697,YES,Brown2007,Article,"OBJECTIVES: In this study, we assessed the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns and prevalence of methicillin resistance among Staphylococcus aureus isolates from hospital and community sources in southern Jamaica. METHODS: Eighty isolates of S. aureus obtained from hospital and community-based patients with staphylococcal infections were collected, and antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined by disk diffusion. RESULTS: While all specimens yielded isolates, multidrug-resistant isolates were obtained only from urine, high vaginal swab, abscess aspirate, and catheter tip samples. The overall prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was 23{\%}. The proportions of MRSA isolated from hospital sources (18/39) and community sources were 46{\%} and 0{\%}, respectively (p{\textless}0.05). The pattern of antibiotic susceptibility of S. aureus differed significantly between MRSA and methicillin-susceptible (MSSA) isolates. For MRSA isolates, multiple-drug resistance was common and only few antibiotics were active against these isolates. However, no MRSA was resistant to vancomycin. Except for penicillin and to some extent co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), most MSSA isolates were susceptible to nearly all antimicrobial agents used in this study. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of MRSA from this region of Jamaica. Because methicillin resistance is associated with multiple-drug resistance in S. aureus, it is imperative that surveillance initiatives be focused on both the hospital and community in order to monitor and limit the spread of this organism.",P D Brown and C Ngeno,"1201-9712 (Print)

This study investigated the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns, conjugative transferability, and molecular characterization of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae in the Philippines. METHODS: ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae were collected from patients at the Philippine General Hospital from June 2000 to August 2001. The antimicrobial susceptibility patterns were determined using the standard disk diffusion assay. ESBL production was confirmed using the double-disk synergy assay and the E-test, while the ESBLs were characterized for type using polymerase chain reaction, sequencing, and isoelectric focusing. Conjugation studies were conducted in vitro on solid medium. RESULTS: All of the ESBL-producing isolates were also resistant to most other classes of antimicrobials studied. The ESBL genes on conjugative and non-conjugative plasmids were bla(SHV-12). Fifteen isolates also carried bla(TEM-1). None of the isolates were positive for the CTX-M type of ESBL. Plasmids from cefoxitin-resistant isolates did not produce amplified products using CMY primers for the AmpC gene. CONCLUSIONS: SHV-12 is the dominating ESBL among the Enterobacteriaceae studied. The gene bla(SHV-12) is carried together with genes for multiple resistance to other classes of antimicrobials in conjugative and nonconjugative plasmids.",E C Cabrera and R D Rodriguez,1684-1182,J Microbiol Immunol Infect,"Conjugation, Genetic,Drug Resistance, Bacterial/*genetics,Enterobacteriaceae Infections/*microbiology,Enterobacteriaceae/*enzymology/genetics,Humans,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Philippines,beta-Lactamases/*genetics",74--85,{First report on the occurrence of SHV-12 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in the Philippines},NA,42,2009,1,"1995-9133

3225,YES,Cassir2013,Article,"Introduction. Nocardial infections, although rare, are challenging for clinicians to treat. Recent contradictory reports of sulfonamide resistance have raised concerns about using this drug to treat nocardial infections. Case presentation. A 62-year-old immunocompetent Caucasian woman showed disseminated pulmonary nodules and a brain abscess by chest computed tomography and brain magnetic resonance imaging, respectively. Multidrug-resistant Nocardia wallacei was cultured from a stereotactic brain biopsy and confirmed by 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid gene sequencing. After the first-line treatment failed, a long course of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was prescribed with no evidence of recurrence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a Nocardia wallacei disseminated infection in an immunocompetent patient, and it is the first detailed description of successful treatment with trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole despite the resistance observed in vitro. Conclusion: Species identification of clinical isolates is critical for diagnosis, a prediction of antimicrobial susceptibility and epidemiological tracking. In the case of Nocardia wallacei, the clinical outcome suggests that sulfonamides can be used for treatment despite ambiguous results from in vitro susceptibility tests. {\textcopyright} 2013 Cassir et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",N Cassir and M Million and R Noudel and M Drancourt and P Brouqui,1752-1947,Journal of Medical Case Reports,"C reactive protein,Caucasian,Nocardia,Nocardia wallacei,RNA 16S,RNA sequence,adult,ambient air,amikacin,antibiotic resistance,antibiotic sensitivity,antibiotic therapy,article,ataxic aphasia,bacterium culture,bacterium identification,bacterium isolate,bacterium isolation,blood toxicity,brain abscess,brain biopsy,broth dilution,case report,ceftriaxone,ciprofloxacin,computer assisted tomography,contrast enhancement,cotrimoxazole,craniotomy,diffusion weighted imaging,drug eruption,drug substitution,drug treatment failure,drug withdrawal,dyspnea,female,fiberoptic bronchoscopy,follow up,frontal lobe,headache,human,human tissue,imipenem,immunocompetence,in vitro study,linezolid,long term care,lung lavage,lung nodule,minimum inhibitory concentration,moxifloxacin,multidrug resistance,neuroimaging,neutropenia,nocardiosis,nuclear magnetic resonance imaging,nucleotide sequence,parietal lobe,pleura effusion,pleurisy,pneumonia,prescription,priority journal,recurrent infection,stereotactic biopsy,sulfonamide,surgical drainage,thorax pain,thorax radiography,treatment duration,treatment withdrawal,urban area",NA,{Sulfonamide resistance in a disseminated infection caused by Nocardia wallacei: A case report},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L52538162 http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1752-1947-7-103 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=17521947{\&}id=doi:10.1186{\%}2F1752-1947-7-103{\&}atitle=Sulfonamide+resista,7,2013,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,YES,Allison,YES,Nchedo,Nchedo,Zach,yes,,

In this report, a rifampicin-resistant M.bovis BCG strain isolated from an infant with NEMO defect was presented. An 8-month-old male infant with NEMO defect admitted to the pediatric outpatient clinic of our hospital with fever, generalized lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly. Microscopic examination of the smears prepared from lymph node and liver biopsy specimens revealed abundant amount (3+) of acid-fast bacilli (AFB). Rifampicin-susceptible Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) was detected by real-time PCR (GeneXpert MTB/RIF; Cepheid, USA) in the samples. The growth of mycobacteria was determined on the 20th day of culture performed in MGIT960 system (Becton Dickinson, USA). The isolate was identified as M.bovis BCG by GenoType MTBC kit (Hain Lifescience, Germany) and defined as M.bovis BCG [SIT 482 (BOV{\_}1)] by spoligotyping. In the primary anti-tuberculosis drug susceptibility test performed by MGIT960 system, the isolate was found susceptible to rifampicin (RIF), isoniazid (INH), streptomycin (STM) and ethambutol (EMB). Then anti-tuberculosis treatment was started to the patient. However, the patient at the age of 2 years, re-admitted to the hospital with the complaint of hepatosplenomegaly. Smear of spontaneously draining abscess material obtained from subcutaneous nodules revealed intensive AFB positivity (3+) once again. In the present instance RIF-resistant MTC was detected with GeneXpert system in the specimen. The growth of mycobacteria was determined on the 13th day of culture and isolate was identified as M.bovis BCG. The present isolate was found susceptible to INH, STM and EMB but resistant to RIF. A mutation in the rpoB gene (codon 531, S531L) associated with RIF resistance was detected by using the partial sequencing of the rpoB gene. Patient died due to disseminated bovis BCG infection and multiple organ failure. To our knowledge, there are only six RIF-resistant M.bovis BCG strains isolated from patients in the literature.

3651,MAYBE,Chen2016f,Article,"OBJECTIVES: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a major public health concern worldwide. This is the first nationwide study, performed within the China Gonococcal Antimicrobial Susceptibility Programme (China-GASP), regarding AMR, including ceftriaxone genetic resistance determinants, and molecular epidemiology of gonococci in China. METHODS: Gonococcal isolates (n = 1257) from consecutive patients were collected at 11 sentinel sites distributed across China during 2012-13. Susceptibility to ceftriaxone, spectinomycin, ciprofloxacin and tetracycline was determined using the agar dilution method. Ceftriaxone resistance determinants penA and penB were examined using sequencing. N. gonorrhoeae multiantigen sequence typing (NG-MAST) was performed for molecular epidemiology. RESULTS: Among isolates, 0.2{\%} were resistant to spectinomycin, 4.4{\%} to ceftriaxone, 42.9{\%} to tetracyclines (high-level resistance) and 99.8{\%} to ciprofloxacin. Among 890 sequenced isolates, 16 (1.8{\%}) possessed a penA mosaic allele; 4 of these isolates belonged to the MDR internationally spread NG-MAST genogroup G1407 (first description in China). Non-mosaic penA alleles with an A501T mutation and an A102D alteration in porB1b were statistically associated with decreased susceptibility/resistance to ceftriaxone. NG-MAST G10339, G1424 and G1053 were associated with decreased susceptibility/resistance to ceftriaxone. CONCLUSIONS: In China, ceftriaxone and spectinomycin can continue to be recommended for gonorrhoea treatment, with the possible exception of Hainan and Sichuan provinces where ceftriaxone resistance exceeded 5{\%} and AMR surveillance needs to be strengthened. Molecular approaches including genotyping and AMR determinant analysis can be valuable to supplement and enhance conventional surveillance of gonococcal AMR in China.",S C Chen and Y P Yin and X Q Dai and M Unemo and X S Chen,0305-7453,J Antimicrob Chemother,"*beta-Lactam Resistance,Adolescent,Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology,Ceftriaxone/*pharmacology,China/epidemiology,DNA, Bacterial/chemistry/genetics,Female,Genes, Bacterial,Genotype,Gonorrhea/*epidemiology/microbiology,Humans,Male,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Middle Aged,Molecular Epidemiology,Multilocus Sequence Typing,Neisseria gonorrhoeae/*classification/*drug effect,Sequence Analysis, DNA,Young Adult,purification",92--99,{First nationwide study regarding ceftriaxone resistance and molecular epidemiology of Neisseria gonorrhoeae in China},NA,71,2016,1,"1460-2091

Methods Eight cases of infection with gonococci exhibiting azithromycin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ≥256 €..mg/L were identified from patients in Leeds as part of the routine service provided by the Sexually Transmitted Bacteria Reference Unit. All patient records were reviewed to collate epidemiological and clinical information including evaluation of patient management. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on seven gonococcal isolates to determine Neisseria gonorrhoeae multiantigen sequence type (NG-MAST), WGS comparison and mutations in the 23S rRNA genes. Results All patients were heterosexual (five male, three female) from a range of ethnic backgrounds and from the Leeds area. Three patients were linked by partner notification. All patients were infected at genital sites and two women had pharyngeal infection also. Six patients received the recommended first-line therapy for uncomplicated gonorrhoea, one was treated for pelvic inflammatory disease and one received spectinomycin followed later by ciprofloxacin. Test of cure was achieved in seven patients and confirmed successful eradication. All seven isolates sequenced were identical by NG-MAST and WGS comparison, and contained an A2143G mutation in all four 23S rRNA alleles. Conclusions Epidemiological and microbiological investigations confirm that an outbreak of a gonococcal strain showing HL-AziR is ongoing in the North of England.

After the index case was detected in an 18-bed medical intermediate care unit, a number of interventions was implemented, including targeted active surveillance for VRE, strict contact precautions, enhanced standard precautions, dedicated units for VRE cases, extensive cleaning of the environment and the restricted use of antibiotics. VRE isolates were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) testing. A prevalence case-control study was conducted. Among 3,699 culture samples from 2,671 patients screened, 74 patients (2.8{\%}) had VRE. The positivity rate declined from 15.1{\%} during week 1 to 8.2{\%} during week 2 and then 1.4{\%} during week 3. By weeks 4-9, the prevalences were 0-2.7{\%}. However, the prevalence rose to 9.4{\%} during week 10 and then subsequently declined. All VRE isolates were Enterococcus faecium and had the vanA gene. RAPD analysis revealed a single predominant clone. Multivariate analysis showed mechanical ventilation for ≥ 7 days was a predictive factor for VRE colonization [odds ratio (OR) 11.47; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 1.75-75.35; p = 0.011]. This experience demonstrates VRE can easily spread and result in an outbreak in multiple-bed units. Active surveillance, early infection control interventions and rapid patient cohorting were important tools for control of this outbreak.

3910,MAYBE,Chrisment2012,Article,"OBJECTIVES: Mycoplasma genitalium is a sexually transmitted organism associated with non-gonococcal urethritis in men and several inflammatory reproductive tract syndromes in women. Resistance to macrolides has been recently associated with point mutations in the 23S rRNA gene. The aim of this study was to detect these mutations using a large French collection of M. genitalium-positive specimens. We evaluated whether these mutations were related to azithromycin treatment failure and whether macrolide-resistant M. genitalium may be spreading. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study conducted in France between 2003 and 2010 included 156 urogenital clinical specimens from 136 patients that were positive for M. genitalium. Mutations in domain V of M. genitalium 23S rRNA were detected using amplification and sequencing. The mutated strains were genotyped by studying single nucleotide polymorphisms in the mgpB gene. RESULTS: We have detected macrolide resistance-associated mutations in M. genitalium since 2006 at a rate of 13.2{\%}, ranging from 10{\%} to 15.4{\%} of patients per year. Nine mutations at position 2059 as well as two A2058G substitutions, one A2062T substitution and one C2038T substitution (Escherichia coli numbering) were identified in M. genitalium. These patients had treatment failure with azithromycin in 75{\%} (6/8) of cases. For one patient, genotyping showed selection for the mutation during treatment with azithromycin. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, we describe macrolide resistance for M. genitalium in France and demonstrate that its detection has increased since 2006.

4775,MAYBE,DeFrancesco2014,Article,"Primary clarithromycin resistance is the main factor affecting the efficacy of Helicobacter pylori therapy. This study aimed: (i) to assess the concordance between phenotypic (culture) and genotypic (real-time PCR) tests in resistant strains; (ii) to search, in the case of disagreement between the methods, for point mutations other than those reported as the most frequent in Europe; and (iii) to compare the MICs associated with the single point mutations. In order to perform real-time PCR, we retrieved biopsies from patients in whom H. pylori infection was successful diagnosed by bacterial culture and clarithromycin resistance was assessed using the Etest. Only patients who had never been previously treated, and with H. pylori strains that were either resistant exclusively to clarithromycin or without any resistance, were included. Biopsies from 82 infected patients were analysed, including 42 strains that were clarithromycin resistant and 40 that were clarithromycin susceptible on culture. On genotypic analysis, at least one of the three most frequently reported point mutations (A2142C, A2142G and A2143G) was detected in only 23 cases (54.8{\%}), with a concordance between the two methods of 0.67. Novel point mutations (A2115G, G2141A and A2144T) were detected in a further 14 out of 19 discordant cases, increasing the resistance detection rate of PCR to 88{\%} (P{\textless}0.001; odds ratio 6.1, 95{\%} confidence interval 218.6) and the concordance to 0.81. No significant differences in MIC values among different point mutations were observed. This study suggests that: (i) the prevalence of the usually reported point mutations may be decreasing, with a concomitant emergence of new mutations; (ii) PCR-based methods should search for at least six point mutations to achieve good accuracy in detecting clarithromycin resistance; and (iii) none of the tested point mutations is associated with significantly higher MIC values than the others. {\textcopyright} 2014 SGM.",V {De Francesco} and A Zullo and F Giorgio and I Saracino and C Zaccaro and C Hassan and E Ierardi and A {Di Leo} and G Fiorini and V Castelli and G {Lo Re} and D Vaira and G L Re and D Vaira,0022-2615,Journal of Medical Microbiology,",*Point Mutation,Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology,Bacterial/genetics,Clarithromycin/*pharmacology,DNA,Drug Resistance,Genotype,Helicobacter Infections/epidemiology/*microbiology,Helicobacter infection,Helicobacter pylori,Helicobacter pylori/drug effects/*genetics,Humans,Italy,Italy/epidemiology,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Phenotype,RNA,Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction,Ribosomal/*genetics,Ribosomal/genetics,antibiotic resistance,antibiotic sensitivity,article,bacterial gene,bacterial mutation,bacterial strain,bacterium culture,clarithromycin,controlled study,epsilometer test,genotype,human,human tissue,major clinical study,minimum inhibitory concentration,phenotype,point mutation,priority journal,real time polymerase chain reaction,ribosome RNA",453--457,{Change of point mutations in Helicobacter pylori rRNA associated with clarithromycin resistance in Italy},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L372479110 http://dx.doi.org/10.1099/jmm.0.067942-0 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=00222615{\&}id=doi:10.1099{\%}2Fjmm.0.067942-0{\&}atitle=Change+of+point+muta,63,2014,Pt 3,"From Duplicate 2 (Change of point mutations in Helicobacter pylori rRNA associated with clarithromycin resistance in Italy - De Francesco, V; Zullo, A; Giorgio, F; Saracino, I; Zaccaro, C; Hassan, C; Ierardi, E; Di Leo, A; Fiorini, G; Castelli, V; Lo Re, G; Vaira, D)

4990,MAYBE,DeMartini2016,Article,"Learning Objectives: Kytococcus schroeteri is a new genus separate from, but similar to, Micrococcus. It is a Gram-positive, non-encapsulated organism. Culture isolates may be dismissed as contaminants; however, Kytococcus is highly virulent in immunocompromised patients. In this report we discuss the first pediatric immunocompromised patient with Kytococcus schroeteri. Methods: Our patient was a 17 year old male with Myelodysplastic Syndrome who developed fever, hypoxia, hypotension and acute kidney injury. A blood culture grew Grampositive cocci in clusters which were identified as Micrococcus species and but later speciated as Kytococcus. Antibiotics were changed from a fourth generation cephalosporin to a glycopeptide and carbapenem. Despite high frequency oscillation and aggressive resuscitation of shock, he progressed to multiple organ failure and death. Kytococcus is usually regarded as a skin or mucosal contaminant. Recently, Kytococcus has become recognized as pathogen in immunocompromised adults and patients with prosthetics. Patients with immunosuppression overwhelmingly succumb to the infection; however those with indwelling prosthetics tend to survive. Kytococcus is often suspected when Micrococcus is found to be resistant to penicillin and oxacillin. Kytococcus has been shown to be resistant to beta-lactams and macrolides; sensitive to vancomycin, teicoplanin, rifampicin, imipenem, tetracycline, gentamicin, and linezolid; and variably resistant to quinolones. Results: In this report we discuss the first pediatric immunocompromised patient with a recently identified organism, Kytococcus schroeteri. Clinicians who encounter pediatric patients with immunocompromise or prosthetics should be cognizant that a culture with “Micrococcus” may be life threating infections secondary to Kytococcus. Ideal antibiotic coverage is not yet known. Kytococcus is resistant to penicillins, a characteristic which differs from Micrococcus.

A 28-year-old HIV-positive male presented with a high fever, non-productive cough, right subcostal pain, splenomegaly, a very low CD4 count, elevated C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and a normal white blood cell count. The suspicion of tuberculosis (TB) was very high, and sputum samples were positive for acid-fast bacilli. Standard quadruple anti-TB therapy was initiated, but once culture of the sample revealed Mycobacterium kansasii, pyrazinamide was withdrawn. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was initiated soon after, consisting of abacavir/lamivudine and efavirenz. The patient's general condition deteriorated 2 weeks after HAART initiation, which could have been due to the development of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS).

5251,MAYBE,Dimitrov2006,Article,"Objective: To present the first documented case of acute infectious gastroenteritis caused by high-level ceftriaxone-resistant Salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium in Kuwait. Subject and Methods: Isolation from stool specimen and species identification of current enteric pathogen was carried out according to standard methods. Susceptibility to antibiotics was determined by the disc diffusion method on Mueller-Hinton agar. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were measured with E-test strips. The production of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) was studied by the double disc synergy method and E-test ESBL strips. Plasmid DNA isolation was performed by the rapid alkaline lysis method. Plasmid DNA was transferred by conjugation to a recipient strain of Escherichia coli. Results: The isolate of S. enterica serotype typhimurium was resistant to ceftriaxone (MIC {\textgreater}256 mg/l), cefotaxime and ceftazidime, and produced ESBL. Ceftriaxone and cefotaxime resistance were co-transferred on a 3.2-kb plasmid to the E. coli recipient strain. Loss of the 3.2-kb plasmid from the transconjugant resulted in the co-loss of ceftriaxone and cefotaxime resistance confirming the carriage of ceftriazone resistance on the 3.2-kb plasmid. Conclusion: Plasmid-mediated high-level resistance to ceftriaxone and ESBL production in Salmonella serotype typhimurium is an emerging problem among Salmonella that requires closer monitoring of antimicrobial resistance among these bacterial species.

We observed mutations in vraS and graR during non-susceptibly development and novel stop codons in the reverted strain.

5361,MAYBE,Dolejska2012,Article,"Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular epidemiology of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae in a children oncological clinic in the Czech Republic. Methods: From June 2009 to January 2010 a total of 51 ESBLproducing isolates were obtained from rectal swab samples of thirty patients. Further characterization with regard to ESBL enzymes, plasmid-mediated quinolone-resistance genes (PMQR), multilocus sequence types (MLST) and plasmids was performed. Results: ESBL-producing strains were identified as Klebsiella pneumoniae (36), Escherichia coli (7), K. oxytoca (3), Enterobacter cloacae (3) and Citrobacter freundii (2). K. pneumoniae isolates belonged to seven MLST: 280, 321, 323, 419 and novel types 626, 627, 628. The multiresistant highly virulent epidemic E. coli O25b-ST131 clone was detected in one patient. The gene blaCTX-M-15 was found on large conjugative FIIK plasmids, considered as virulence plasmids specific for Klebsiella spp., along with blaTEM-1b, blaOXA-1, qnrB1, aac(6)-Ib-cr, strA, sul2, aac(3)-II and tetA in most isolates including the O25b-ST131 clone. Sequences of copA gene of all FIIK plasmids were identical and showed the allele type 6. Conclusion: Spreading of particular clones among patients and dissemination of FIIK plasmids among bacterial species were considered to be likely involved in the ESBL bacteria infections in the clinic.

5879,MAYBE,Endimiani2011,Article,"Linezolid (LZD)-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (LRSA) isolates were monitored from 2000 to 2009 in Cleveland, OH. LRSA first emerged in 2004 only in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, with 11 LRSA-infected CF patients being identified by 2009. LRSA was isolated from 8 of 77 CF patients with S. aureus respiratory tract infection treated with LZD from 2000 to 2006. Analysis of clinical data showed that the 8 CF patients with LRSA received more LZD courses (18.8 versus 5.9; P = 0.001) for a longer duration (546.5 versus 211.9 days; P {\textless} 0.001) and had extended periods of exposure to LZD (83.1 versus 30.1 days/year; P {\textless} 0.001) than the 69 with LZD-susceptible isolates. Five LRSA isolates included in the clinical analysis (2000 to 2006) and three collected in 2009 were available for molecular studies. Genotyping by repetitive extrapalindromic PCR and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed that seven of these eight LRSA strains from unique patients were genetically similar. By multilocus sequence typing, all LRSA isolates were included in clonal complex 5 (seven of sequence type 5 [ST5] and one of ST1788, a new single-locus variant of ST5). However, seven different variants were identified by spa typing. According to the Escherichia coli numbering system, seven LRSA isolates contained a G2576T mutation (G2603T, S. aureus numbering) in one to four of the five copies of domain V of the 23S rRNA genes. One strain also contained a mutation (C2461T, E. coli numbering) not previously reported. Two strains, including one without domain V mutations, possessed single amino acid substitutions (Gly152Asp or Gly139Arg) in the ribosomal protein L3 of the peptidyltransferase center, substitutions not previously reported in clinical isolates. Emergence of LRSA is a serious concern for CF patients who undergo prolonged courses of LZD therapy. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2011, American Society for Microbiology.

6058,MAYBE,Fakih2014,Article,"INTRODUCTION: Mycobacterium fortuitumsternal wound infection following cardiac surgery is a rare occurrence but has considerable morbidity because of emergence of resistant strains. We present a patient who was successfully treated for sternal wound infection caused by a Clarithromycin resistant M. fortuitum (CRMF). CASE PRESENTATION: A 62-year-old male with history of dyslipidemia, hypertension, asthma, and nicotine dependence underwent coronary artery bypass grafting and left ventricular aneurysmorrhaphy after having myocardial infarction. He developed a small wound at the cephalic end of the sternotomy scar draining thick, brown, odorless discharge three weeks postoperatively. He was immediately taken to the operating room for debridement of a track which was noticed extending from the cephalic end. No organisms were seen on direct staining but after two days, many acid fast bacilli were identified in the aerobic culture. Patient's empirical antibiotics were switched to clarithromycin, levofloxacin and linezolid. Two weeks after discharge, the organism was identified as Mycobacterium fortuitum by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) with resistance to clarithromycin and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (TMP/SMZ). With a six month course of levofloxacin and doxycycline, the patient had an excellent recovery including wound closure. No recurrence was noted during two years of follow-up. DISCUSSION: Infection due to M. fortuitum is often resistant to all the standard anti-tuberculosis drugs, but clarithromycin, TMP/SMZ, doxycycline, and ciprofloxacin are usually recommended in combination according to in the vitro sensitivity data. Many M. fortuitum used to be susceptible to clarithromycin, but studies have shown that all isolates of M. fortuitum contain an erythromycin methylase gene, erm, which may induce macrolide resistance and contribute in an emergence of clarithromycin resistant strains. Consequently combination therapy is recommended for M. fortuitum with at least two susceptible medications in the era of emerging CRMF. CONCLUSIONS: A high index of suspicion based on clinical presentation is essential to diagnose Clarithromycin resistant M. fortuitum (CRMF) post cardiac surgery sternal infection for proper long term therapy. Beside surgical debridement appropriate blend of antibiotics based on sensitivity will ensure complete healing and prevent recurrence.",H A M Fakih and S Ahmad and E Elueze,0012-3692,Chest,"Mycobacterium,Mycobacterium fortuitum,acid fast bacterium,antibiotic agent,asthma,ciprofloxacin,clarithromycin,coronary artery bypass graft,cotrimoxazole,debridement,doxycycline,drug therapy,dyslipidemia,erythromycin,follow up,gene,healing,heart infarction,heart surgery,high performance liquid chromatography,human,hypertension,infection,levofloxacin,linezolid,long term care,macrolide,male,methyltransferase,morbidity,operating room,organisms,patient,scar,staining,sternotomy,therapy,tobacco dependence,tuberculosis,wound,wound closure,wound infection",NA,{Emerging clarithromycin resistant mycobacterium fortuitum in post cardiac surgery sternal wound infection},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L71780482 http://dx.doi.org/10.1378/chest.1993853 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=00123692{\&}id=doi:10.1378{\%}2Fchest.1993853{\&}atitle=Emerging+clarithromycin,146,2014,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,YES,Erica,NO,Mushtaq,Ayomide,Zach,no,could not find full-text,

To eradicate this micro-organism, numerous regimens containing various antimicrobial agents have been suggested. However, H pylori antimicrobial resistance is a leading factor to treatment failure and recurrence of the disease. The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of H pylori resistance to metronidazole, clarithromycin, tetracycline, amoxicillin, erythromycin and furazolidone in authors pediatric patients. METHODS: Antral biopsy of all pediatric patients with negative history of receiving anti-H pylori regimen and endoscopic findings of nodular gastritis or peptic ulcer without previous history of NSAID consumption, burning and trauma were performed for H pylori histology, urease test and culture. All positive cultures were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility. RESULTS: Twenty four patients (14 male and 10 female) between 3.5 and 14 years of age were culture positive. 54.16{\%} of the isolates were resistant to metronidazole, 8.33{\%} to amoxicillin, 4.16{\%} to erythromycin and 4.16{\%} to clarithromycin. None of authors patients were resistant to tetracycline and furazolidone. CONCLUSION: H. pylori antimicrobial resistance could be a major contributor to failure of H pylori eradication.

This study determined the antibiotic resistance and molecular epidemiology of CNSAb isolates from a referral burn center in Tehran, Iran. Sixty-nine CNSAb isolates were tested for susceptibility to antimicrobial agents using the E test methodology. Multiple locus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA), Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and multiplex PCR were performed. PCR assays tested for ambler classes A, B, and D $\beta$-lactamases. Detection of ISAba1, characterization of integrons, and biofilm formation were investigated. Fifty-three (77{\%}) isolates revealed XDR phenotypes. High prevalence of blaOXA-23-like (88{\%}) and blaPER-1 (54{\%}) were detected. ISAba1 was detected upstream of blaADC, blaOXA-23-like and blaOXA51-like genes in, 97, 42, and 26{\%} of isolates, respectively. Thirty-one (45{\%}) isolates were assigned to international clone (IC) variants. MLVA identified 56 distinct types with six clusters and 53 singleton genotypes. Forty previously known MLST sequence types forming 5 clonal complexes were identified. The Class 1 integron (class 1 integrons) gene was identified in 84{\%} of the isolates. The most prevalent (33{\%}) cassette combination was aacA4-catB8-aadA1. The IC variants were predominant in the A. baumannii lineage with the ability to form strong biofilms.

The aim of this study was to describe the first nosocomial bloodstream infection outbreak caused by Enterobacter ludwigii co-harbouring CTX-M-8, SHV-12 and TEM-15 in a NICU in a Venezuelan hospital. Initial bacterial identification was achieved by VITEK{\textregistered}2 system and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (VITEK{\textregistered} MS) and was subsequently confirmed by nucleotide sequencing of the 16S rDNA gene and hsp60 genotyping. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was determined by AST-GN-299 VITEK{\textregistered}2 system cards and Etest strips. Isolates were typed by repetitive element sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR). Detection of blaESBL genes was carried out by molecular methods. Plasmid analysis included Southern blot and restriction pattern analysis, with transferability of resistance genes being assessed by conjugation. ESBL-producing E. ludwigii isolates were recovered from three neonates with bloodstream infection from the NICU in a 21-day period. rep-PCR fingerprints were indistinguishable among all of the isolates, strongly suggesting spread of a clonal strain. All isolates carried an ca. 56 kb conjugative plasmid harbouring the blaCTX-M-8, blaSHV-12 and blaTEM-15 genes. Considering that isolation of ESBL-producing E. ludwigii remains an unusual phenomenon, not previously reported in Venezuela, the results of this study reveal the potential role of E. ludwigii as an emerging pathogen and highlight the importance of microbiological surveillance and judicious antibiotic use as measures to curb the emergence and spread of ESBL-producing bacteria.",A Flores-Carrero and I Labrador and A Paniz-Mondolfi and D R Peaper and D Towle and M Araque,"2213-7173

7014,MAYBE,Gartner2012,Article,"During routine microbiological analysis of various clinical specimen from 20 outpatients and inpatients at the University of Saarland Medical Center, two species of Acinetobacter baumannii complex were isolated, and confirmed using conventional microbiology and mass spectrometry. Antimicrobial resistance testing revealed resistance to all betalactams tested including carbapenems. Between mid-April and mid-June, 2012, positive specimens were identified either sporadically, or in temporal clusters. Apart from two control specimen (rectal swabs for surveillance of neonates), all other patients either revealed one or several negative microbiologic controls of the same sample site, or were lost for follow-up due to dismissal. None of the patients had signs or symptoms indicative for infection. They were treated in various departments and clinics, including orthopedics, pediatrics, intensive care, gynecology, ENT, urology, and internal medicine. A large spectrum of age, clinical specimen, and underlying disease was observed. Molecular fingerprinting of the isolates using arbitrarily primed PCR revealed identical band patterns, and the additional typing of select isolates at the National Reference Center confirmed species ID, antimicrobial resistance, and presence of a metallobetalactamase of GIM-1 genotype. Patients were isolated, and infection control measures were reinforced according to standard principles for carbapenemase producing gramnegative bacilli. Extended epidemiologic workup, however, did not reveal any factors for transmission, previous hospitalizations, nor common places of residence. Extensive analysis of specimen workup in the microbiologic laboratory rendered a laboratory associated pseudooutbreak highly unlikely. The University of Saarland Medical Center provides of one of the largest subterranean PTS systems in Europe linking all clinical buildings in a tube system of approximately 15 km in length, and providing {\textgreater}300.000 specimen transports to the various laboratories in addition to numerous nonlaboratory transports. Extensive environmental investigations revealed positive results for Acinetobacter spp (GIM-1) of identical AP-PCR type on 8/13 patient data sheets which accompanied the initial positive specimen, as well as PTS cartridges prospectively analyzed. Positive microbiological results were associated with humidity in the cartridges whose origin appears to be the result of extensive condensation of warm ambient pressure air in the PTS tubes, and water collection in lower tube segments. Fluid contamination of cartridges and specimen containers appears a plausible explanation for specimen positivity as well as for the periodicity of the pseudooutbreak manifestations. Upon identification of the cause for this large pseudooutbreak, all clinical infection control measures were lifted, yet, rigorous measures for hygienic handling of PTS stations, cartridges, and transported specimens were introduced. Currently, extensive measures are underway to decontaminate the PTS. In conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the worldwide first description of a large-scale contamination of a-hospital PTS. In absence of established environmental hygiene standards, bacterial contamination of PTS may occur for extended time periods prior to recognition, and may be the cause not only for pseudooutbreaks but also for transmission of nosocomial pathogens with yet unknown consequences. This experience suggests that establishment of standards is necessary for the particular challenge which PTS may represent for hospital hygiene.",B Gärtner and A Dawson and S Gatermann and A Halfmann and M Kaase and M Klotz and P Lüttchens and C Petit and R Veith and L {Von Müller} and M Herrmann,1438-4221,International Journal of Medical Microbiology,"Acinetobacter,Acinetobacter baumannii,Bacilli,Europe,antibiotic resistance,bacterium contamination,carbapenem derivative,carbapenemase,contamination,environmental sanitation,follow up,genotype,gynecology,hospital,hospital hygiene,hospital patient,hospitalization,human,humidity,hygiene,infection,infection control,intensive care,internal medicine,laboratory,liquid,mass spectrometry,microbiology,newborn,orthopedics,otorhinolaryngology,outpatient,pathogenesis,patient,patient coding,pediatrics,periodicity,species,tube,university,university hospital,urology,water",119,{A pseudooutbreak due to Acinetobacter spp. (GIM-1) contamination of a pneumatic transport system (PTS) of a large university hospital},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L70938258 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmm.2012.08.002 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=14384221{\&}id=doi:10.1016{\%}2Fj.ijmm.2012.08.002{\&}atitle=A+pseudooutbr,302,2012,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,MAYBE,Brooke,MAYBE,Mushtaq,Mushtaq,Zach,yes,,

The source of Company A brand chicken consumed by case-patients was traced back to 3 California production establishments from which 6 of 7 outbreak strains were isolated. Conclusions: Epidemiologic, laboratory, traceback, and environmental investigations conducted by local, state, and federal public health and regulatory officials indicated that consumption of Company A chicken was the cause of this outbreak. The outbreak involved multiple PFGE patterns, a variety of chicken products, and 3 production establishments, suggesting a reservoir for contamination upstream from the production establishments. Sources of bacteria and genes responsible for resistance, such as farms providing birds for slaughter or environmental reservoir on farms that raise chickens, might explain how multiple PFGE patterns were linked to chicken from 3 separate production establishments and many different poultry products.",L Gieraltowski and J Higa and V Peralta and A Green and C Schwensohn and H Rosen and T Libby and B Kissler and N Marsden-Haug and H Booth and A Kimura and J Grass and A Bicknese and B Tolar and S Defibaugh-Chávez and I Williams and M Wise and C Braden and A C Brown and L Burnworth and A Crawley and A Douris and S Frink and D Goldman and M Hung-Fan and D Kiang and S Lew and J Nakao and M Needham and R Tauxe and M Wong and L Allen and R Atkinson and C B Behravesh and K Becker and A Blackstock and J Folster and D Gilliss and K Holt and R Leifert and J Lidgard and A Poe and J Pringle and W Probert and M Rickard and K Robertson and E Trees and D Vetter and D Vugia,1932-6203,PLoS ONE,"Salmonella enterica serovar Heidelberg,United States,adolescent,adult,aged,ampicillin,antibiotic resistance,article,bacterial load,bacterial strain,bacterium contamination,bacterium isolate,child,chloramphenicol,controlled study,epidemic,female,gentamicin,human,infant,infection control,kanamycin,major clinical study,male,nonhuman,poultry product,pulsed field gel electrophoresis,questionnaire,salmonellosis,streptomycin,sulfafurazole,tetracycline",NA,{National outbreak of multidrug resistant Salmonella Heidelberg infections linked to a single poultry company},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L612857004 http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0162369 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=19326203{\&}id=doi:10.1371{\%}2Fjournal.pone.0162369{\&}atitle=National,11,2016,9,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,MAYBE,Cale,MAYBE,Zach,Zach,Zach,yes,,

OBJECTIVE: To describe an outbreak of CRKP in Puerto Rico, determine risk factors for CRKP acquisition, and detail the successful measures taken to control the outbreak. DESIGN: Two case-control studies. SETTING: A 328-bed tertiary care teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Twenty-six CRKP case patients identified during the outbreak period of February through September 2008, 26 randomly selected uninfected control patients, and 26 randomly selected control patients with carbapenem-susceptible K. pneumoniae (CSKP) hospitalized during the same period. METHODS: We performed active case finding, including retrospective review of the hospital's microbiology database and prospective perirectal surveillance culture sampling in high-risk units. Case patients were compared with each control group while controlling for time at risk. We sequenced the bla(KPC) gene with polymerase chain reaction for 7 outbreak isolates and subtyped these isolates with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: In matched, multivariable analysis, the presence of wounds (hazard ratio, 19.0 [95{\%} confidence interval {\{}CI{\}}, 2.5-142.0]) was associated with CRKP compared with no K. pneumoniae. Transfer between units (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 7.5 [95{\%} CI, 1.8-31.1]), surgery (adjusted OR, 4.0 [95{\%} CI, 1.0-15.7]), and wounds (adjusted OR, 4.9 [95{\%} CI, 1.1-21.8]) were independent risk factors for CRKP compared to CSKP. A novel K. pneumoniae carbapenemase variant (KPC-8) was present in 5 isolates. Implementation of active surveillance for CRKP colonization and cohorting of CRKP patients rapidly controlled the outbreak.

Methods: Three ESC resistant N. gonorrhoeae isolates were cultured from the urethral discharge of three men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM), two residing in Johannesburg and one in Cape Town. One of the MSM reported a persistent urethral discharge which had failed to respond to previous therapy with oral cefixime. Agar dilution minimum inhibitory concentration assays were performed for eight antibiotics. The Johannesburg patients' isolates were further characterised by identification of key $\beta$-lactam-associated resistance mutations in penA, mtrR and its promoter, porB1b, ponA, and pilQ through PCR-based amplification and DNA sequencing. For molecular epidemiological characterisation, all three isolates were typed by N. gonorrhoeae multi-antigen sequencing typing (NG-MAST); additionally, full-length porB gene sequencing and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) were performed for the Johannesburg isolates. Results: All three isolates were resistant to cefixime, ciprofloxacin, penicillin and tetracycline, intermediate/resistant to azithromycin but susceptible to ceftriaxone and gentamicin. The Johannesburg isolates had the type XXXIV penAmosaic allele in addition to previously described resistance mutations in the mtrR promoter (A deletion), porB1b (penB) (G101K, A102N) and ponA1 (L421P). All three isolates had an identical N. gonorrhoeae multi-antigen sequence type (ST4822). The two Johannesburg isolates had an identical multi-locus sequence type (ST1901). Conclusions All three strains were resistant to cefixime and were epidemiologically linked with identical NG-MAST sequence types. The Johannesburg isolates possessed a number of key $\beta$-lactam-associated resistance mutations and the type XXXIV penAmosaic allele.

7985,MAYBE,Guschin2015,Article,"BACKGROUND: Azithromycin has been widely used for Mycoplasma genitalium treatment internationally. However, the eradication efficacy has substantially declined recent decade. In Russia, josamycin (another macrolide) is the recommended first-line treatment for M. genitalium infections, however, no data regarding treatment efficacy with josamycin and resistance in M. genitalium infections have been internationally published. We examined the M. genitalium prevalence in males attending an STI clinic in Moscow, Russia from December 2006 to January 2008, investigated treatment efficacy with josamycin in male urethritis, and monitored the M. genitalium DNA eradication dynamics and selection of macrolide resistance in M. genitalium during this treatment. METHODS: Microscopy and real-time PCRs were used to diagnose urethritis and non-viral STIs, respectively, in males (n = 320). M. genitalium positive patients were treated with recommended josamycin regimen and treatment efficacy was monitored using quantitative real-time PCR. Macrolide resistance mutations were identified using sequencing of the 23S rRNA gene. RESULTS: Forty-seven (14.7{\%}) males were positive for M. genitalium only and most (85.1{\%}) of these had symptoms and signs of urethritis. Forty-six (97.9{\%}) males agreed to participate in the treatment efficacy monitoring. All the pre-treatment M. genitalium specimens had wild-type 23S rRNA. The elimination of M. genitalium DNA was substantially faster in patients with lower pre-treatment M. genitalium load, and the total eradication rate was 43/46 (93.5{\%}). Of the six patients with high pre-treatment M. genitalium load, three (50{\%}) remained positive post-treatment and these positive specimens contained macrolide resistance mutations in the 23S rRNA gene, i.e., A2059G (n = 2) and A2062G (n = 1). CONCLUSIONS: M. genitalium was a frequent cause of male urethritis in Moscow, Russia. The pre-treatment M. genitalium load might be an effective predictor of eradication efficacy with macrolides (and possibly additional antimicrobials) and selection of macrolide resistance. Additional in vivo and in vitro data are crucial to support the recommendation of using josamycin as first-line treatment for M. genitalium infections in Russia. It would be valuable to develop international M. genitalium management guidelines, and quantitative diagnostic PCRs determining also M. genitalium load and resistance mutations (for macrolides and ideally also moxifloxacin) should ideally be recommended.",A Guschin and P Ryzhikh and T Rumyantseva and M Gomberg and M Unemo,1471-2334,BMC Infectious Diseases,",*Bacterial Load/drug effects/genetics,Adolescent,Adult,Aged,AmpliSens,Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology,Bacterial/*drug effects,Bacterial/analysis/genetics,Chlamydia trachomatis,DNA,Drug Resistance,Herpes simplex virus 2,Humans,Josamycin/pharmacology/*therapeutic use,Macrolides/*pharmacology/therapeutic use,Male,Middle Aged,Mycoplasma Infections/*drug therapy/epidemiology/m,Mycoplasma genitalium,Mycoplasma genitalium/drug effects/genetics/*isola,Neisseria gonorrhoeae,Polymerase Chain Reaction,Prevalence,RNA 23S,RNA sequence,Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction,Russia/epidemiology,Russian Federation,Treatment Failure,Treatment Outcome,Trichomonas vaginalis,Urethritis/*drug therapy/epidemiology/microbiology,Young Adult,adult,aged,antibiotic resistance,article,azithromycin,bacterial DNA,bacterial clearance,bacterial load,bacterium detection,clinical feature,drug efficacy,drug monitoring,drug treatment failure,gene mutation,human,josamycin,macrolide,major clinical study,male,microscopy,micturition,minimum inhibitory concentration,moxifloxacin,mutational analysis,nonhuman,patient compliance,polymerase chain reaction system,prevalence,pristinamycin,quantitative analysis,real time polymerase chain reaction,sexually transmitted disease,treatment duration,urethritis",40,"{Treatment efficacy, treatment failures and selection of macrolide resistance in patients with high load of Mycoplasma genitalium during treatment of male urethritis with josamycin}",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L602614386 http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12879-015-0781-7 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=14712334{\&}id=doi:10.1186{\%}2Fs12879-015-0781-7{\&}atitle=Treatment+effi,15,2015,1,"From Duplicate 1 (Treatment efficacy, treatment failures and selection of macrolide resistance in patients with high load of Mycoplasma genitalium during treatment of male urethritis with josamycin - Guschin, A; Ryzhikh, P; Rumyantseva, T; Gomberg, M; Unemo, M)

8616,YES,Higgins2010,Article,"The mechanism of stepwise acquired multidrug resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii isolates from a hospitalized patient was investigated. Thirteen consecutive multidrug-resistant isolates were recovered from the same patient over a 2-month period. The Vitek 2 system identified the isolates as meropenem-sensitive Acinetobacter lwoffii; however, molecular identification showed that the isolates were A. baumannii. Etest revealed that the isolates were meropenem resistant. The presence of oxacillinase (OXA)-type enzymes were investigated by sequencing. The clonal relatedness of isolates was assessed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Expression of the genes encoding the efflux pumps AdeB and AdeJ was performed by semiquantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR). The adeRS two-component system was sequenced. All isolates had identical PFGE fingerprints, suggesting clonal identity. The first six isolates were positive for the novel blaOXA-164 gene. The following seven isolates, recovered after treatment with a combination of meropenem, amikacin, ciprofloxacin, and co-trimoxazole showed an increase of {\textgreater}7-fold in adeB mRNA transcripts and a missense mutation in bla OXA-164, converting it to blaOXA-58. Sequencing revealed a novel mutation in adeR. These data illustrate how A. baumannii can adapt during antimicrobial therapy, leading to increased antimicrobial resistance.

8862,MAYBE,Hopkins2007a,Article,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of qnr genes in selected Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli isolated in the UK. METHODS: One hundred and eighteen S. enterica and 103 E. coli were screened for qnrA, qnrB and qnrS by PCR. Transferability of qnr plasmids was assessed and isolated plasmids compared with previously identified qnr plasmids by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and hybridization experiments. PCRs and sequencing identified co-transferred beta-lactamase genes and mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining region of gyrA. RESULTS: Only six S. enterica strains belonging to four serotypes (Stanley, Typhimurium, Virchow and Virginia) were positive for qnrS1. qnrS1 was present on plasmids of 13.5 kb (TPqnrS-1a and -1b) in Typhimurium and Virginia isolates, 44 kb (TPqnrS-2) in two Virchow isolates and {\textgreater}148 kb (TPqnrS-3a and -3b) in two Stanley isolates. bla(TEM-1) and a group 9 bla(CTX-M) were co-transferred on TPqnrS-2 and TPqnrS-3b. Hybridization of a qnrS1 probe to digested qnrS1 plasmids suggested qnrS1 on TPqnrS-2 may be located in a similar genetic environment to Shigella qnrS plasmid pAH0376, but in a different environment in the other plasmids. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance in a Salmonella isolate from the UK; five isolates were associated with foreign travel to, or food imported from, the Far East. The presence of qnrS1 on different plasmid backbones in several Salmonella serotypes suggests successful dissemination of plasmids or qnrS1. It is of concern that qnrS1 is being identified in Salmonella serotypes that are commonly implicated in human infection in the UK. Coupled with beta-lactam resistance, it may compromise treatment of vulnerable patient groups.",K L Hopkins and L Wootton and M R Day and E J Threlfall,"0305-7453 (Print)

8916,YES,Hottes2013,Article,"BACKGROUND: Widespread resistance of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to penicillin, tetracycline, and fluoroquinolones has challenged effective treatment and control; recent international case reports of cefixime, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin resistance suggest that the remaining treatment options are now additionally threatened. To explore trends in antimicrobial susceptibility of N. gonorrhoeae, we reviewed provincial laboratory data from British Columbia, 2006 to 2011. METHODS: Susceptibility testing was performed for all N. gonorrhoeae isolates detected in-house or forwarded to the reference laboratory. Resistance or intermediate resistance (nonsusceptibility) was defined by standard breakpoints for penicillin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, and spectinomycin. Elevated minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) at serial dilutions of 0.064 $\mu$g/mL or greater were explored for cefixime/ceftriaxone and 0.5 $\mu$g/mL or greater for azithromycin. Nonsusceptibility/elevated MIC was compared by year, site of infection, sex, and age. RESULTS: A total of 1837 isolates representing 22{\%} of all reported gonorrhea cases were analyzed. Nonsusceptibility to penicillin was established at baseline. Nonsusceptibility to tetracycline and ciprofloxacin increased over the study period, reaching 96{\%} and 36{\%}, respectively, in 2011. Sixteen isolates (1{\%}) had a cefixime MIC of 0.25 $\mu$g/mL (none ≥0.5), none had a ceftriaxone MIC of 0.25 $\mu$g/mL or greater, and 15 (1{\%}) had an azithromycin MIC of 2.0 $\mu$g/mL or greater. Elevated MIC of these agents showed an increasing trend over time. Nonsusceptibility and elevated MIC were consistently highest at the rectal and pharyngeal sites and higher in isolates from males, including when stratified to the pharyngeal site. INTERPRETATION: Increases in elevated MIC of cefixime/ceftriaxone/azithromycin were superimposed on a background of established resistance to penicillin, tetracycline, and ciprofloxacin and may signal impending gonococcal resistance to first-line treatments. Ongoing surveillance will inform timely shifts in treatment recommendations.

METHODS: The eight isolates were recovered from clinical specimens or rectal swabs. Antibiotic susceptibilities were determined using standard agar diffusion and dilution methods including synergy tests. PFGE was used to study the relatedness of isolates. Genes encoding beta-lactamases were characterized by transfer assays, specific amplification and cloning. RESULTS: The eight isolates were closely related by PFGE analysis and highly related to a K. pneumoniae strain from Greece. They were highly resistant to beta-lactams, including aztreonam and imipenem (MIC {\textgreater} or =32 mg/L), and were positive by the imipenem-EDTA disc synergy test. Isolates were also resistant to aminoglycosides, newer quinolones and sulfamethoxazole, and showed an intermediate level of resistance to tetracycline. VIM-1 and SHV-5 beta-lactamases were revealed in all isolates by PCR. The analysis of plasmid contents of Escherichia coli DH10B electroporants expressing the VIM-1 beta-lactamase or the SHV-5 beta-lactamase confirmed that the two enzymes were coded by two different plasmids.

10648,MAYBE,Kim2013h,Article,"INTRODUCTION: The standard triple therapy which was combined with proton pump inhibitor (PPI), amoxicillin and clarithromycin was widely used for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection in Korea. However, the recent trend of the eradication rates in H. pylori using first-line triple therapy has been infrequently reported. AIMS{\&}METHODS: The aims of this study were to evaluate the trend of the H. pylori eradication rates in single center during recent six years and to identify the risk factors relating the failure of eradication therapy. From January 2007 to December 2012, H. pylori eradication rates in 1168 patients who diagnosed with H. pylori infection and received 7 days triple therapy were investigated according to years, demographic and clinical factors retrospectively. H. pylori eradication was confirmed by 13C-urea breath test, rapid urease test or histopathological examination at least 4 weeks after the completion of triple therapy. RESULTS: The overall H. pylori eradication rate was 84.5{\%}. The annual eradication rates from the year 2007 to 2012 were 91.9{\%}, 89.1{\%}, 85.5{\%}, 84.3{\%}, 84.5{\%} and 79.0{\%} consecutively by per-protocol analysis. The eradication rate in first-line triple therapy was decreased during the recent six years (p = 0.024). Multivariate analysis showed that female (OR 1.55; 95{\%} CI 1.02-2.36) and smoking (OR 1.60; 95{\%} CI 1.03-2.48) were associated with the failure of H. pylori eradication therapy. CONCLUSION: The effect of first-line triple therapy for H. pylori infection has decreased during recent six years, which suggests that the antibiotic resistant H. pylori has increased against the therapy based on the combination of PPI, amoxicillin and clarithromycin. Therefore, other variable first-line therapies might be considered for H. pylori eradication in the near future.",S E Kim and M I Park and S J Park and W Moon and Y J Choi and J H Cheon and H J Kwon and K H Ku and C H Yoo,2050-6406,United European Gastroenterology Journal,"European,Helicobacter infection,Helicobacter pylori,Korea,amoxicillin,antibiotic agent,clarithromycin,eradication therapy,examination,female,gastroenterology,human,infection,multivariate analysis,patient,proton pump inhibitor,pylorus,rapid urease test,risk factor,smoking,therapy,urea breath test,urea c 13",A424,{The trend of eradication rate of first-line the trend in the eradication rates of first-line therapy for helicobacter pylori infection and risk factors of eradication therapy},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L72264259 http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2050640613502900 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=20506406{\&}id=doi:10.1177{\%}2F2050640613502900{\&}atitle=The+trend+of+erad,1,2013,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,MAYBE,Erica,MAYBE,Mushtaq,Mushtaq,Zach,no,could not get full-text in English,

Because of the difficulty in accurate species identification of C. gilardii, there are few case reports of infection caused by this organism. In previous reports, C. gilardii has been characterized as an organism with low pathogenicity that causes opportunistic infections. Case presentation: We encountered a case of pacemaker-associated bloodstream infection caused by C. gilardii in a 90-year old woman without obvious immunodeficiency. We identified the isolates as C. gilardii by sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The patient was treated with removal of the lead and administration of antimicrobial agents. Because of the acquisition of antibiotic resistance during antibiotic treatment, the antimicrobial agent was changed during the course of treatment. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first report of an infection caused by this organism in a patient without obvious immunodeficiency. Although the true pathogenicity of C. gilardii is unclear, the possibility that it exerts pathogenicity not only in persons with immunodeficiency but also in immunocompetent persons is suggested.",T Kobayashi and I Nakamura and H Fujita and A Tsukimori and A Sato and S Fukushima and K Ohkusu and T Matsumoto,1471-2334,BMC Infectious Diseases,"Cupriavidus,Cupriavidus gilardii,Gram negative infection,RNA 16S,RNA gene,add on therapy,aged,amikacin,antibiotic resistance,antibiotic therapy,antiinfective agent,article,aztreonam,bacterial virulence,bacterium identification,bacterium isolate,bloodstream infection,case report,cefepime,ceftazidime,cilastatin plus imipenem,ciprofloxacin,cotrimoxazole,device infection,drug substitution,female,gene sequence,gentamicin,human,immunocompetence,implanted heart pacemaker,levofloxacin,meropenem,minocycline,piperacillin,piperacillin plus tazobactam,sultamicillin,very elderly,virus gene",NA,{First case report of infection due to Cupriavidus gilardii in a patient without immunodeficiency: A case report},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L612249194 http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12879-016-1838-y http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=14712334{\&}id=doi:10.1186{\%}2Fs12879-016-1838-y{\&}atitle=First+case+rep,16,2016,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NO,Erica,MAYBE,Mushtaq,Ayomide,Zach,yes,,
11163,MAYBE,Kuan2015,Article,"The outbreak of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) has become an increasing problem in many TB-burdened countries. The underlying drug resistance mechanisms, including the genetic variation favored by selective pressure in the resistant population, are partially understood. Recently, the first case of XDR-TB was reported in Malaysia. However, the detailed genotype family and mechanisms of the formation of multiple drugs resistance are unknown. We sequenced the whole genome of the UM 1072388579 strain with a 2-kb insert-size library and combined with that from previously sequenced 500-bp-insert paired-end reads to produce an improved sequence with maximal sequencing coverage across the genome. In silico spoligotyping and phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that UM 1072388579 strain belongs to an ancestral-like, non-Beijing clade of East Asia lineage. This is supported by the presence of a number of lineage-specific markers, including fadD28, embA, nuoD and pks7. Polymorphism analysis showed that the drug-susceptibility profile is correlated with the pattern of resistance mutations. Mutations in drug-efflux pumps and the cell wall biogenesis pathway such as mmpL, pks and fadD genes may play an important role in survival and adaptation of this strain to its surrounding environment. In this work, fifty-seven putative promoter SNPs were identified. Among them, we identified a novel SNP located at -4 T allele of TetR/acrR promoter as an informative marker to recognize strains of East Asian lineage. Our work indicates that the UM 1072388579 harbors both classical and uncommon SNPs that allow it to escape from inhibition by many antibiotics.

11179,MAYBE,Kudinha2013,Article,"The recent emergence of multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli sequence type 131 (ST131) has coincided with an increase in general antibiotic resistance of E. coli, suggesting that ST131 has a contributing role in resistance. However, there is little information about the contribution of ST131 to different clinical syndromes or the basis for its impressive emergence and epidemic spread. To investigate this, we studied 953 E. coli isolates from women of reproductive age in the central west region of New South Wales, Australia, including 623 urinary isolates from patients with cystitis (cystitis isolates) (n = 322) or pyelonephritis (pyelonephritis isolates) (n = 301) and 330 fecal isolates from healthy controls. The characteristics studied included ST131 clonal group status, resistance to different antibiotics, presence of virulence factor (VF) genes, and biofilm production. As expected, fecal isolates differed significantly from urinary (cystitis and pyelonephritis) isolates in most of the studied characteristics. Antibiotic resistance was significantly more common in ST131 than in non-ST131 isolates. Both antibiotic resistance and ST131 were more common in pyelonephritis than cystitis isolates and least so among fecal isolates. Within each source group, individual VF genes were more prevalent and VF scores were higher for ST131 than for non-ST131 isolates. For ST131 only, the prevalences of most individual VF genes and VF scores were the lowest in the fecal isolates, higher in the cystitis isolates, and highest in the pyelonephritis isolates. Biofilm production was strongly associated with ST131 status and antibiotic resistance. These results clarify the distribution of the ST131 clonal group and its epidemiological associations in our region and suggest that it exhibits both enhanced virulence and increased antibiotic resistance compared with those of other urinary tract infection (UTI) and fecal E. coli isolates from women of reproductive age.",T Kudinha and J R Johnson and S D Andrew and F Kong and P Anderson and G L Gilbert,0095-1137,J Clin Microbiol,"*Drug Resistance, Bacterial,Adolescent,Adult,Biofilms/growth {\&} development,Escherichia coli Infections/epidemiology/*microbio,Escherichia coli/classification/*drug effects/gene,Female,Genotype,Humans,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Middle Aged,Molecular Epidemiology,Molecular Typing,New South Wales/epidemiology,Prevalence,Prospective Studies,Urinary Tract Infections/*microbiology,Virulence Factors/genetics,Young Adult",3270--3276,{Escherichia coli sequence type 131 as a prominent cause of antibiotic resistance among urinary Escherichia coli isolates from reproductive-age women},NA,51,2013,10,"1098-660x

11465,YES,Lambiase2006,Article,"BACKGROUND: Recent reports document an increasing incidence of new Gram-negative pathogens such as Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Alcaligenes xylosoxidans isolated from patients with Cystic Fibrosis, along with an increase in common Gram-negative pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia complex. Furthermore, the increase in multidrug-resistance of such organisms makes the therapeutic management of these patients more problematic. Therefore, careful isolation and identification, and accurate studies of susceptibility to antibiotics are critical for predicting the spread of strains, improving therapeutic measures and facilitating our understanding of the epidemiology of emerging pathogens. The first aim of this study was to determine the incidence and the prevalence of colonization by Gram-negative organisms isolated from respiratory samples of Cystic Fibrosis patients in the Regional Referral Cystic Fibrosis Centre of Naples; the second was to evaluate the spectrum of multidrug-resistance of these organisms. METHODS: Patients (n = 300) attending the Regional Cystic Fibrosis Unit were enrolled in this study over 3 years. Sputum was processed for microscopic tests and culture. An automated system, Phoenix (Becton Dickinson, Sparks, Maryland, USA), was used for phenotypic identification of all strains; the API 20 NE identification system (bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) was used when the identification with the Phoenix system was inaccurate. A PCR-RFLP method was used to characterize the organisms in the Burkholderia cepacia complex. A chemosusceptibility test on microbroth dilutions (Phoenix) was used. Primary outcomes such as FEV1 were correlate with different pathogens. RESULTS: During the period of study, 40{\%} of patients was infected by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 7{\%} by Burkholderia cepacia complex, 11{\%} by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and 7{\%} by Alcaligenes xylosoxidans. Of the strains isolated, 460 were multidrug-resistant. Multiresistant were Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia complex. CONCLUSION: The results confirm previously reported data; in particular, they show an increase the isolation of non-fermentative Gram-negative bacteria in Cystic Fibrosis patients. They also demonstrate increased resistance to antibiotics. Beta-lactams are rarely effective, with exception of ceftazidime, which is the most efficacious agent against multiresistant strains.

12446,YES,Logan2016a,Article,"Metallo-$\beta$-lactamases (MBLs) are emerging as the most notable resistance determinants in Enterobacteriaceae. In many cases, the genes encoding MBLs are part of complex, mobile genetic elements that carry other resistance determinants. In the United States, there are increasing reports of MBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, with New Delhi MBLs (NDMs) accounting for the majority of transmissible MBL infections. Many infections caused by NDM-producing bacteria are associated with international travel and medical tourism. However, little recognition of the introduction of MBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae into the pediatric community has followed. Reports suggest that this occurred as early as 2002. Here, we reflect on the unwelcome emergence of MBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in US children and the available clinical and molecular data associated with spread. Since 2002, there have been disturbing reports that include the most readily transmissible MBLs, blaIMP, blaVIM, and blaNDM types.

We describe a cluster of colistin-resistant, carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae infection cases involving three institutions in Detroit, MI. A cluster of five cases of colistin-resistant, carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae was identified at Detroit Medical Center (DMC) from 27 July to 22 August 2009. Epidemiologic data were collected, and transmission opportunities were analyzed. Isolates were genotyped by using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and repetitive extragenic palindromic PCR. Data regarding the use of colistin were obtained from pharmacy records. The index case of colistin-resistant, carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae was followed 20 days later by four additional cases occurring in a 6-day interval. All of the patients, at some point, had stayed at one particular institution. The mean number of opportunities for transmission between patients was 2.3 +/- 0.5, and each patient had at least one opportunity for transmission with one of the other patients. Compared to 60 colistin-susceptible, carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae controls isolated in the previous year at DMC, case patients were significantly older (P = 0.05) and the carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae organisms isolated from them displayed much higher MICs to imipenem (P {\textless} 0.001). Colistin use was not enhanced in the months preceding the outbreak. Genotyping revealed two closely related clones.

13216,MAYBE,Marlow2014,Article,"Low-income communities, health care professionals, and adults in frequent contact with children are all populations known to be at higher risk for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonization. The objective of our investigation was to determine risk factors for colonization with MRSA as well as staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) genotypes among pediatric health care workers from a public hospital in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. We collected nasal swabs and data on potential risk factors from 178 health care workers from all pediatric sectors from January to December 2012. Swab cultures were evaluated for antimicrobial resistance against Cefoxitin and Oxacillin, and resistance was confirmed by identifying the mecA gene by PCR. MRSA colonization was 5.1{\%} (n=9/178). Logistic regression analysis showed being a nurse and working in an inpatient unit as potential risk factors for MRSA colonization (adjusted OR= 11.6, 95{\%} CI 1.2 - 110.7 and 2.7, 95{\%} CI 0.3 - 23.7, respectively). No non-work related risk factors were identified. Four of the nine isolates were found to be SCCmec type IV, the genotype most commonly associated with community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA). Five isolates were observed to be SCCmec type III, with four collected from nurses of various pediatric sectors in August/September alone. We then compared these isolates with nasal MRSA isolates sampled from children within 48 hours of being admitted to the pediatric ward from December 2011 to July 2012. Of 11 CA-MRSA isolates from 92 children sampled (12.0{\%}), ten were found to be SCCmec IV, including two which preceded those collected from nurses in the same sector. Given SCCmec type III isolates appear to have circulated among various pediatric sectors, the introduction of the more virulent CA-MRSA genotype to the pediatric inpatient ward is of high concern.

Both isolates showed susceptibility patterns suggestive of harbouring a plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase (pACBL) and a plasmid-encoded quinolone resistance (PMQR). PCR-based replicon, MOB typing, plasmid profile and Southern hybridization analyses revealed that both isolates coharboured bla(DHA-1) and qnrB genes on the same IncL/M-MOB(P13) plasmid approximately 70 kb in size. Together with the fact that both plasmids were conjugative in the laboratory, these results strongly suggest that a horizontal transfer event could take place in vivo. This is the first report of an isolate of S. marcescens harbouring a pACBL. The only phenotypic method that suggests the presence of a pACBL in an isolate harbouring an inducible chromosomal AmpC enzyme is the observation of scattered colonies near the edge of the inhibition zones of some beta-lactams.

Of these, oxacillin and levofloxacin resistances are chromosomally encoded. Plasmid-mediated clindamycin, mupirocin, and/or tetracycline resistance has been observed among USA300 isolates, but these descriptions were limited to specific patient populations or isolated occurrences. We examined the antimicrobial susceptibilities of invasive MRSA isolates from a national surveillance population in order to identify USA300 isolates with unusual, possibly emerging, plasmid-mediated antimicrobial resistance. DNA from these isolates was assayed for the presence of resistance determinants and the presence of a pSK41-like conjugative plasmid. Of 823 USA300 isolates, 72 (9{\%}) were tetracycline resistant; 69 of these were doxycycline susceptible and tetK positive, and 3 were doxycycline resistant and tetM positive. Fifty-one (6.2{\%}) isolates were clindamycin resistant and ermC positive; 22 (2.7{\%}) isolates were high-level mupirocin resistant (mupA positive); 5 (0.6{\%}) isolates were trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) resistant, of which 4 were dfrA positive; and 7 (0.9{\%}) isolates were gentamicin resistant and aac6′-aph2″ positive. Isolates with pSK41-like plasmids (n = 24) were positive for mupA (n = 19), dfrA (n = 6), aac6′-aph2″ (n = 6), tetM (n = 2), and ermC (n = 8); 20 pSK41-positive isolates were positive for two or more resistance genes. Conjugative transfer of resistance was demonstrated between four gentamicin- and mupirocin-resistant and three gentamicin- and TMP-SMZ-resistant USA300 isolates; transconjugants harbored a single pSK41-like plasmid, which was PCR positive for aac6′-aph2″ and either mupA and/or dfrA. USA300 and USA100 isolates from the same state with identical resistance profiles contained pSK41-like plasmids with indistinguishable restriction and Southern blot profiles, suggesting horizontal plasmid transfer between USA100 and USA300 isolates.

14105,YES,Miyamoto2013a,Article,"Purpose: We report a case of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) keratitis after Descemet's stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK). Case Report: An 87-year-old woman who had undergone a DSAEK 4 months previously was referred to Tokushima University Hospital with a diagnosis of infectious keratitis after DSAEK. A white abscess and infiltration in the inferior cornea of the right eye were observed. We started an empiric therapy using topical levofloxacin and chloramphenicol on the basis of the microscopic findings of the corneal scraping concurrently with cultivation of the cornea. Results: A strain of MRSA was isolated from the corneal sample. Although the strain was susceptible to chloramphenicol, it was resistant to quinolone. The keratitis improved rapidly due to empiric therapy, and topical steroids could be resumed 6 days after initiation of the empiric therapy. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first case of MRSA keratitis, and the second case of bacterial keratitis, after DSAEK. MRSA keratitis can occur following uneventful DSAEK. The empiric therapy on the basis of results from a light microscopic examination of a Gram-stained corneal scraping and restarting topical steroids in the early stages of medication contributed to the good clinical course of this case. {\textcopyright} 2013 S.

This study compared the antimicrobial susceptibilities of 153 P. aeruginosa isolates from the United Kingdom (UK) (n = 58), Belgium (n = 44), and Germany (n=51) collected from 118 patients during routine visits over the period from 2006 to 2012. MICs were measured by broth microdilution. Genes encoding extended-spectrum $\beta$-lactamases (ESBL), metallo-$\beta$-lactamases, and carbapenemases were detected by PCR. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing were performed on isolates resistant to≥3 antibiotic classes among the penicillins/cephalosporins, carbapenems, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, and polymyxins. Based on EUCAST/CLSI breakpoints, susceptibility rates were≥30{\%}/≥40{\%} (penicillins, ceftazidime, amikacin, and ciprofloxacin), 44 to 48{\%}/48 to 63{\%} (carbapenems), 72{\%}/72{\%} (tobramycin), and 92{\%}/78{\%} (colistin) independent of patient age.

The Liverpool epidemic strain (LES) was prevalent in UK isolates only (75{\%} of MDR isolates). Four MDR sequence type 958 (ST958) isolates were found to be spread over the three countries. The other MDR clones were evidenced in≥3 isolates and localized in a single country. A new sequence type (ST2254) was discovered in one MDR isolate in Germany.

Since 2012, in Central Greece an increase of colistin/pan- resistant A. baumannii has occurred, indicating the need for further analysis. METHODS: A total of 86 colistin-resistant/carbapenem-resistant out of 1228 A. baumannii clinical isolates, consecutively collected between 2012 and 2014 in a tertiary Greek hospital of Central Greece, as well as one environmental isolate from surveillance cultures were studied. Molecular typing and mechanisms of resistance to colistin and to carbapenems were assessed, whereas, epidemiological and clinical data of the patients were reviewed. RESULTS: During the study period, the rate of colistin resistance gradually increased and reached 21.1 {\%} in 2014. All colistin-resistant/carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii belonged to 3LST ST101 clone that corresponds to the international clonal lineage II. Carbapenem resistance was associated with the presence of bla oxa-23-like, while resistance to colistin probably correlated with G54E and R109H amino acid substitutions in PmrA and PmrC, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Epidemiological data of the patients indicated that the first detection of colistin-resistant/carbapenem-resistant ST101 clone in the University Hospital of Larissa (UHL) was associated with a patient who previously had received colistin, while, the movement of the infected patients into the hospital probably resulted to its spread.",O Oikonomou and S Sarrou and C C Papagiannitsis and S Georgiadou and K Mantzarlis and E Zakynthinos and G N Dalekos and E Petinaki,1471-2334,BMC Infectious Diseases,",Acinetobacter Infections/epidemiology/microbiology,Acinetobacter baumannii,Acinetobacter baumannii/*drug effects/isolation {\&},Acinetobacter infection,Aged,Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology,Bacterial/drug effects,Carbapenems/*pharmacology,Colistin/*pharmacology,DNA extraction,Drug Resistance,Electrophoresis,Female,Gel,Greece,Greece/epidemiology,Hospitals,Humans,IpxA gene,IpxD gene,Male,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Middle Aged,Molecular Typing,Multiple,Pulsed-Field,aged,amino acid substitution,aminoglycoside antibiotic agent,antibiotic resistance,antibiotic sensitivity,article,bacterial gene,bacterial protein,bacterial strain,bacterium identification,bacterium isolate,blood culture,bloodstream infection,brain ventriculitis,carbapenem,chronic kidney failure,chronic liver disease,chronic lung disease,colistin,comorbidity,controlled study,daptomycin,diabetes mellitus,disease surveillance,epidemic,female,fever,fosfomycin,gene mutation,heart disease,human,major clinical study,male,minimum inhibitory concentration,molecular typing,neurologic disease,pmrCAB gene,pneumonia,polymerase chain reaction,prevalence,protein PmrA,protein PmrC,pyelonephritis,quinoline derived antiinfective agent,tigecycline,unclassified drug,ventilator associated pneumonia",559,"{Rapid dissemination of colistin and carbapenem resistant Acinetobacter baumannii in Central Greece: mechanisms of resistance, molecular identification and epidemiological data}",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L607201359 http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12879-015-1297-x http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=14712334{\&}id=doi:10.1186{\%}2Fs12879-015-1297-x{\&}atitle=Rapid+dissemin,15,2015,1,"From Duplicate 2 (Rapid dissemination of colistin and carbapenem resistant Acinetobacter baumannii in Central Greece: mechanisms of resistance, molecular identification and epidemiological data - Oikonomou, O; Sarrou, S; Papagiannitsis, C C; Georgiadou, S; Mantzarlis, K; Zakynthinos, E; Dalekos, G N; Petinaki, E)

METHODS: The Steroids for Corneal Ulcers Trial (SCUT) was a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled trial assessing outcomes in patients with culture positive bacterial corneal ulcers randomized to receive prednisolone phosphate or placebo. All patients received moxifloxacin, and susceptibility to moxifloxacin was measured at baseline using Etest. We investigated trends in moxifloxacin susceptibility of P. aeruginosa during 2007, 2008, and 2009 isolated in SCUT in South India. RESULTS: There were 89 P. aeruginosa isolates during 2007, 2008, and 2009 in SCUT that were eligible for this study. There was an increase in the proportion of resistant isolates from 19{\%} in 2007 to 52{\%} in 2009 (p = 0.02, chi(2) test for trend). Logistic regression showed that there was a 2-fold increase in odds of resistance per 1 year increase during the study period (odds ratio 2.16, 95{\%} confidence interval 1.09-4.26, p = 0.027).

Stenotrophomonas maltophila (SM) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) are two pathogens capable of developing multiple drug-resistance (MDR) mechanisms. We report the case of a 56-year-old female patient with a permanent percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD), who was admitted to our hospital with a cholangitis due to a MDR Escherichia coli strain. Upon admission, culture-guided antimicrobial therapy was conducted and the biliary catheter was replaced, with poor clinical response. Subsequently, SM and PA were detected. Treatment with fosfomycin and colistine was initiated, again without adequate response. Systemic colistine and tigecycline along with an intrabiliary infusion of colistine for 5 days was then used, followed by parenteral fosfomycin and tigecycline for 7 days. The patient was then successfully discharged. This is the first case report we are aware of on the use of intrabiliary colistine.

The parC and gyrA QRDRs (quinolone-resistance-determining region) of 11 isolates with ciprofloxacin MICs from 1 to 256 mg/l were analysed by DNA sequencing. In ParC one kind of amino acid substitution (of Ser-85 to Ile) in 9 E. faecalis strains with MICs from 16 to 256 mg/l was observed. In GyrA Ser-84 was changed to one of four different amino acids: Arg, Ile, Cys or Tyr, however no association between the amino acid type and MIC value was found.

Recently, changing in types of pathogens and their antibiotic resistance were reported as important emerging problems. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed medical records of patients with spontaneous ascitic fluid infection in Chiang Mai University Hospital from January 2001 to December 2002 and from January 2008 to September 2009. The isolated pathogens and their antibiotic susceptibility were described and compared. Results: There were 49 episodes of spontaneous ascitic fluid infection from January 2001 to December 2002 and 82 episodes from January 2008 to September 2009. The pathogens were identified in 36.7{\%} and 48.8{\%} respectively. When compared, the ratio of gram negative bacilli (GNB) infection in both periods were similar (p = 0.769) but the pathogens in the second period were significantly more diverse than the first period (p = 0.008 for GNB and p = 0.029 for gram positive cocci) (table 1). Accordingly, there were more types of bacteria that were resistant to the recommended empirical antibiotics in the second period, including ESBL E. coli, Acinetobacter spp., Pseudomonas spp., Streptococcus gr D and Enterococci. (Table Presented) Conclusions: Although the ratios of GNB infection in SBP did not changed in recent year, there were significantly more new types of resistant pathogens which may affect outcomes of treatment.

17038,MAYBE,Qin2014,Article,"The emergence and spread of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1 (NDM-1)-producing carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) present an urgent threat to human health. In China, the bla(NDM-1 gene has been reported mostly in Acinetobacter spp. but is rarely found in Enterobacteriaceae. Here, we report a high incidence and endemic spread of NDM-1-producing CRE in Henan Province in China. Sixteen (33.3{\%}) of the 48 CRE isolates obtained from patients during June 2011 to July 2012 were positive for bla(NDM-1), and the gene was found to be carried on plasmids of various sizes ( approximately 55 to approximately 360 kb). These plasmids were readily transferrable to recipient Escherichia coli by conjugation, conferred resistance to multiple antibiotics, and belonged to multiple replicon types. The bla(NDM-1)-positive CRE isolates were genetically diverse, and six new multilocus sequence typing (MLST) sequence types were linked to the carriage of NDM-1. Five of the isolates were classified as extensively drug-resistant (XDR) isolates, four of which also carried the fosA3 gene conferring resistance to fosfomycin, an alternative drug for treating infections by CRE. In each bla(NDM-1)-positive CRE isolate, the bla(NDM-1) gene was downstream of an intact ISAba125 element and upstream of the bleMBL gene. Furthermore, gene environment analysis suggested the possible transmission of bla(NDM-1)-containing sequences from Acinetobacter spp. to Klebsiella pneumoniae and Klebsiella oxytoca. These findings reveal the emergence and active transmission of NDM-1-positive CRE in China and underscore the need for heightened measures to control their further spread.",S Qin and Y Fu and Q Zhang and H Qi and J G Wen and H Xu and L Xu and L Zeng and H Tian and L Rong and Y Li and L Shan and H Xu and Y Yu and X Feng and H M Liu,0066-4804,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,"Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology,Carbapenems/pharmacology,China/epidemiology,Conjugation, Genetic,DNA, Bacterial/*genetics,Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial/*genetics,Enterobacteriaceae Infections/drug,Enterobacteriaceae/drug effects/enzymology/*geneti,Epidemiological Monitoring,Fosfomycin/pharmacology,Genotype,Humans,Incidence,Multilocus Sequence Typing,Plasmids/*chemistry/metabolism,beta-Lactamases/*genetics,therapy/*epidemiology/microbiology/transmission",4275--4282,"{High incidence and endemic spread of NDM-1-positive Enterobacteriaceae in Henan Province, China}",NA,58,2014,8,"1098-6596

17087,YES,Qureshi2015,Article,"BACKGROUND: With an increase in the use of colistin methansulfonate (CMS) to treat carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii infections, colistin resistance is emerging. METHODS: Patients with infection or colonization due to colistin-resistant A. baumannii were identified at a hospital system in Pennsylvania. Clinical data were collected from electronic medical records. Susceptibility testing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) were performed. To investigate the mechanism of colistin resistance, lipid A was subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Twenty patients with colistin-resistant A. baumannii were identified. Ventilator-associated pneumonia was the most common type of infection. Nineteen patients had received intravenous and/or inhaled CMS for treatment of carbapenem-resistant, colistin-susceptible A. baumannii infection prior to identification of colistin-resistant isolates. The 30-day all-cause mortality rate was 30{\%}. The treatment regimen for colistin-resistant A. baumannii infection associated with the lowest mortality rate was a combination of CMS, a carbapenem, and ampicillin-sulbactam. The colistin-susceptible and -resistant isolates from the same patients were highly related by PFGE, but isolates from different patients were not, suggesting evolution of resistance during CMS therapy. By MLST, all isolates belonged to the international clone II, the lineage that is epidemic worldwide. Phosphoethanolamine modification of lipid A was present in all colistin-resistant A. baumannii isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Colistin-resistant A. baumannii occurred almost exclusively among patients who had received CMS for treatment of carbapenem-resistant, colistin-susceptible A. baumannii infection. Lipid A modification by the addition of phosphoethanolamine accounted for colistin resistance. Susceptibility testing for colistin should be considered for A. baumannii identified from CMS-experienced patients.",Z A Qureshi and L E Hittle and J A O'Hara and J I Rivera and A Syed and R K Shields and A W Pasculle and R K Ernst and Y Doi,1058-4838,Clin Infect Dis,"*Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial,Acinetobacter Infections/complications/*drug thera,Acinetobacter baumannii,Acinetobacter baumannii/*drug effects/genetics/*is,Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Ampicillin/therapeutic use,Carbapenems/*pharmacology/therapeutic use,Colistin/*pharmacology/therapeutic use,Electronic Health Records,Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field,Ethanolamines/chemistry,Female,Humans,Lipid A/chemistry,Male,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Middle Aged,Multilocus Sequence Typing,Pneumonia, Ventilator-Associated/drug therapy/micr,Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorpti,Sulbactam/therapeutic use,carbapenem resistance,colistin resistance,lipid A,molecular typing,purification/pathogenicity",1295--1303,{Colistin-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii: beyond carbapenem resistance},NA,60,2015,9,"1537-6591

17299,MAYBE,Rasheed2014,Article,"BACKGROUND: Antibiotic resistance in Helicobacter pylori contributes to failure in eradicating the infection and is most often due to point and missense mutations in a few key genes. METHODS: The antibiotic susceptibility profiles of H. pylori isolates from 46 Pakistani patients were determined by Etest. Resistance and pathogenicity genes were amplified, and sequences were analyzed to determine the presence of mutations. RESULTS: A high percentage of isolates (73.9{\%}) were resistant to metronidazole (MTZ), with considerable resistance to clarithromycin (CLR; 47.8{\%}) and amoxicillin (AML; 54.3{\%}) also observed. Relatively few isolates were resistant to tetracycline (TET; 4.3{\%}) or to ciprofloxacin (CIP; 13{\%}). However, most isolates (n = 43) exhibited resistance to one or more antibiotics. MTZ-resistant isolates contained missense mutations in oxygen-independent NADPH nitroreductase (RdxA; 8 mutations found) and NADH flavin oxidoreductase (FrxA; 4 mutations found). In the 23S rRNA gene, responsible for CLR resistance, a new point mutation (A2181G) and 4 previously reported mutations were identified. Pathogenicity genes cagA, dupA, and vacA s1a/m1 were detected frequently in isolates which were also found to be resistant to MTZ, CLR, and AML. A high percentage of CagA and VacA seropositivity was also observed in these patients. Phylogenetic analysis of partial sequences showed uniform distribution of the 3' region of cagA throughout the tree. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified H. pylori isolates in Pakistan which harbor pathogenicity genes and worrying antibiotic resistance profiles as a result of having acquired multiple point and missense mutations.

The susceptibility to meticillin of Staphylococcus aureus was investigated directly from one blood culture bottle using GenomEra MRSA/SA (Abacus Diagnostica Oy) test. This test identified S. aureus but the presence of the mecA gene result was negative, and the isolate was reported as meticillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). Susceptibility studies were done using VITEK 2 AST-P588 susceptibility cards (bioMerieux). The strain was identified as MRSA by the VITEK 2 system, although oxacillin MIC was low (0.5 microg ml(-1)). In view of these results, the isolate was tested for the presence of the mecC gene by a specific PCR and was verified as MRSA carrying mecC. The emergence of this new mecA homologue could have important consequences for the detection of MRSA when routine PCR methods are used as an identification method or provisional detection of MRSA, as in the case reported in this article, because S. aureus carrying the mecC gene will be wrongly diagnosed as meticillin susceptible.

However, their effectiveness is being compromised by the emergence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). The genetic determinants encoding ESBL in Salmonella spp. isolated from patients in Kuwait and United Arab Emirates (UAE) were studied over a 2 year period. Out of a total of 407 isolates, 116 isolates possessed the resistance phenotypes consistent with possible ESBL production. Of these, 69 (59.5 {\%}) were ESBL positive. PCR and sequencing were used to determine the genetic determinant(s) responsible for ESBL phenotypes. A total of 14 (12.1 {\%}) and 29 (24.6 {\%}) isolates were CTX-M-15 ESBL producers and TEM producers, respectively. Ten CTX-M-15 producers carried the insertion sequence ISEcpI gene.

This study reports the presence of the bla(CTX-M-15) gene in Salmonella spp. and Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi from Kuwait and UAE for what is believed to be the first time.

METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on the microbiological profiles and antibiotic susceptibilities in 754 strains of pathogens isolated from 519 patients with diabetic foot ulcers at our hospital from January 2010 to August 2013. The inter-group data were compared by Chi-square test. RESULTS: There were 322 (62.0{\%}) males and 197 (38.0{\%}) females. Their mean age was (67.7 +/- 12.3) (30-93) years, duration of diabetes 10 (0-40) years, duration of lower-limb lesion 1.0 (0.0-72.0) months and HbA1c (9.09{\%} +/- 2.28{\%}). Among 444 (85.5{\%}) cases, a total of 754 strains of pathogens were isolated. Gram-positive aerobes were the most frequently isolated (47.3{\%}, 357 strains) and followed by gram-negative aerobes and fungus (40.3{\%} vs 12.3{\%}, 304 vs 93 strains respectively). With rising Wagner's grades, bacterial floras transformed from Gram-positive cocci to Gram-negative rods while fungus and composite infections increased. And 122 strains were of multi drug resistant organisms (MDRO). Among 357 strains of Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis were dominating floras. Staphylococcus was highly resistant to penicillin G, erythromycin, and oxacillin while vancomycin and linezolid were the most effective agents against gram-positive bacteria. Among 304 strains of gram-negative bacteria, enterobacteria were the most prevalent, including 48 strains of Escherichia coli, 34 strains of Proteus mirabilis and 31 strains of Proteus vulgaris. And there were 29 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Enterobacteria were highly resistant to ampicillin, followed by bactrim and furadantin while meropenem, imipenem, piperacillin/sulbactam, sulperazone and cefepime were the most effective agents. The predominant fungus was Blastomyces albicans. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with severe diabetic foot ulcers, Gram-negative rods predominate while the prevalence of fungus and composite infections increases. Vancomycin and imipenem maintain highly antibacterial activity.

19093,MAYBE,Sherwood2011,Article,"This report summarizes the case of a 23 year-old otherwise healthy male that was injured in an improvised explosive device (IED) blast in support of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). He sustained bilateral open tibia and fibula fractures in the setting of being exposed to water contaminated with raw sewage. Despite long-term carbapenem therapy, the patient's wounds were repeatedly noted to have purulent drainage during surgical debridement and cultures from these wounds were persistently positive for Bacteroides fragilis. Apparent clinical failure persisted despite the addition of metronidazole to his regimen and an eventual trial of tigecycline. Susceptibility testing of the B. fragilis isolate was performed and resistance to penicillin, clindamycin,metronidazole, cefoxitin, meropenem, imipenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, and tigecycline was confirmed. The presence of a nimE gene on a potentially transferrable plasmid was also confirmed by plasmid sequencing. The only antibiotics that displayed in vitro susceptibility were moxifloxacin and linezolid. These antibiotics were initiated in combination with aggressive irrigation and serial surgical debridement. Conversion to left-sided internal fixation became feasible and his left lower extremity was salvaged without residual evidence of infection. The patient completed an eight week course of combination moxifloxacin and linezolid therapy without adverse event. This B. fragilis isolate displayed simultaneous high-level resistance to multiple antibiotics routinely utilized in anaerobic infections. This was evidenced by clinical failure, in vitro susceptibility testing, and demonstration of genes associated with resistance mechanisms. This case warrants review not only due to the rarity of this event but also the potential implications regarding anaerobic infections in traumatic wounds and the success of a novel treatment regimen utilizing combination therapy with moxifloxacin and linezolid.",J E Sherwood and S Fraser and D M Citron and H Wexler and G Blakely and K Jobling and S Patrick,1075-9964,Anaerobe,",Afghan Campaign 2001-,Afghanistan,Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology,Bacterial,Bacterial Proteins/genetics,Bacteroides Infections/blood/*microbiology,Bacteroides fragilis,Bacteroides fragilis/*drug effects/genetics/isolat,Bacteroides infection,Blast Injuries/blood/*microbiology,Drug Resistance,Escherichia coli,Genes,Humans,Leg Injuries/*microbiology,Male,Microbial Sensitivity Tests/methods,Multiple,Young Adult,absence of side effects,adult,antibiotic resistance,antibiotic sensitivity,article,bacterium culture,bacterium isolate,blast injury,blood culture,carbapenem,case report,cefoxitin,cervical spine fracture,clindamycin,debridement,fibula fracture,fracture fixation,human,imipenem,leg injury,linezolid,male,meropenem,metronidazole,moxifloxacin,multidrug resistance,nonhuman,penicillin G,piperacillin plus tazobactam,plasmid,priority journal,tibia fracture,tigecycline,tobramycin,vancomycin,water contamination,wound infection,wound irrigation",152--155,{Multi-drug resistant Bacteroides fragilis recovered from blood and severe leg wounds caused by an improvised explosive device (IED) in Afghanistan},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L51330121 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anaerobe.2011.02.007 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=10759964{\&}id=doi:10.1016{\%}2Fj.anaerobe.2011.02.007{\&}atitle=Multi,17,2011,4,"From Duplicate 1 (Multi-drug resistant Bacteroides fragilis recovered from blood and severe leg wounds caused by an improvised explosive device (IED) in Afghanistan - Sherwood, J E; Fraser, S; Citron, D M; Wexler, H; Blakely, G; Jobling, K; Patrick, S)

A combination of biochemical and molecular methods was used to identify the resistance mechanism of this isolate. Carbapenemase production was mediated by Verona integron-encoded metallo-$\beta$-lactamase (VIM)-2. Colistin resistance was not due to plasmid- borne mcr-1 gene, but we found an integration of IS. 5-like sequence in the mgrB gene of K. oxytoca. This gene is known to be an important regulator of the PhoPQ two-component system, and the disruption of this gene is most likely the cause of lipid A modification resulting in colistin resistance of our isolate.

19396,MAYBE,Sinha2012,Article,"Background: The high incidence of ESBL producing strains with scarce prior documentation of the prevalent ESBL genes in Mangalore propulgated this study. It was carried out to evaluate the existence of the CTX-M type genes in ESBL producing strains of Gram negative clinical isolates from Government tertiary care hospital, Mangalore, Karnataka (India). Methods: A total of 116 samples (129 isolates) were collected from patients hospitalised in various wards of Government tertiary care hospital, Mangalore from August 2008 to August 2009. The isolates obtained were identified and confirmed using standard microbiological and biochemical tests. Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 700603 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 were the control strains used. Production of ESBL was tested for all isolates by phenotypic confirmatory test using combination disk containing third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic disk alone (Ceftazidime 30$\mu$g) and in combination with clavulanic acid (Ceftazidime + Clavulanic acid 30/10$\mu$g). A total of 75 isolates from the family Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonas spp which were phenotypically confirmed ESBL producers were evaluated for CTX-M type genes by performingconventional PCR. Results: 58.1{\%} of the clinical isolates were ESBL producers. In our study ESBL production ranged from 40{\%} in Escherichia coli, 34.7{\%} in Klebsiella spp, 16{\%} in Pseudomonas spp, 4{\%} to 1.3{\%} each in Citrobacter spp and Proteus spp. In addition to resistance to third generation cephalosporins, most of these isolates showed resistance to sulfonamides, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin and aztreonam. The ESBL producing strains when subjected to conventional PCR using standard primers showed that out of the 75 isolates tested 51 were positive for blaCTX-M. Conclusion: From the above results, it can be concluded that there is a high prevalence of ESBL producing isolates with CTX-M genes among patients in Government tertiary care hospital, Mangalore. These findings show that in our setting, hospitals provide a favourable environment for the resistant organisms to emerge and disseminate.

We analyzed clinical strains of 16S rRNA methylase-producing Acinetobactor baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa obtained from clinical isolates in medical settings in Vietnam. METHODS: From 2008 to 2011, 101 clinical strains of A. baumannii and 15 of P. aeruginosa were isolated from patients in intensive care units (ICUs) in two medical settings in Vietnam. Antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined using the microdilution method and epidemiological analysis was performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and MLST. Genes encoding the 16S rRNA methylases, OXAs and CTX-Ms were analyzed by PCR and sequence analysis. RESULTS: 16S rRNA methylase-producing Gram-negative pathogens were detected in two hospitals in Vietnam. Of the 101 clinical isolates of A. baumannii and the 15 of P. aeruginosa isolated from two ICUs in these hospitals, 72 (71.3{\%}) were highly resistant to amikacin, arbekacin and gentamicin, with MICs greater than 1,024 mg/L.

Of E. coli strains, 8.4 {\%} were resistant to ceftazidime (CAZ) and 26.3 {\%} to ciprofloxacin (CPFX). No P. aeruginosa strains produced metallo-$\beta$-lactamase. In P. aeruginosa, the resistance rates were 7.4 {\%} to tazobactam/piperacillin (TAZ/PIPC), 10.2 {\%} to imipenem (IPM), 2.8 {\%} to meropenem, cefepime, and CPFX, and 0 {\%} to gentamicin. In the B. fragilis group, the rates were 28.6 {\%} to clindamycin, 5.7 {\%} to cefmetazole, 2.9 {\%} to TAZ/PIPC and IPM, and 0 {\%} to metronidazole (Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron; 59.1, 36.4, 0, 0, 0 {\%}). MIC90 of P. aeruginosa isolated 15 days or later after surgery rose in TAZ/PIPC, CAZ, IPM, and CPFX. In patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score ≥3, the resistance rates of P. aeruginosa to TAZ/PIPC and CAZ were higher than in patients with ASA ≤2. The data obtained in this study revealed the trend of the spread of resistance among common species that cause SSI.

20443,MAYBE,Tamang2007,Article,"A total of 121 Salmonella enterica serovars Typhi and Paratyphi A isolated from enteric fever patients at a university hospital in Nepal between February 2004 and January 2006 were tested for their antimicrobial susceptibility. The occurrence and cassette content of integrons as well as the molecular mechanisms of resistance among the multidrug-resistant (MDR) S. Typhi were evaluated. Thirty-nine percent of the isolates were susceptible to all the antimicrobial agents tested. Seven of the S. Typhi strains were MDR. None of the 121 S. enterica isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin, cefazolin, rifampicin or kanamycin. All MDR S. Typhi isolates contained a class 1 integron with a single cassette, dfrA7, conferring resistance to trimethoprim. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of XbaI-generated genomic restriction fragments yielded 12 different patterns. Five of the seven MDR isolates containing class 1 integrons had an identical PFGE pattern. Resistance to sulfamethoxazole, streptomycin, ampicillin, tetracycline and chloramphenicol was mediated by sul1, strA-strB, blaTEM-like, tetB and catA genes, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of integron-associated multidrug resistance as well as the first molecular characterisation of the mechanism of resistance of S. Typhi isolated from Nepal. This study indicates the spread of integron-associated multidrug resistance in S.

S.putrefaciens is a gram-negative, facultative anaerobic and non-fermentative rod that rarely causes infections in humans. First, the authors reported that antibotic sensitivity tests of S.putrefaciens in the presented case were performed by Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. However, there is no recommendation about the antibiotic susceptibility testing by disc diffusion test for this bacteria in Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI), European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST), and British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC) guidelines. According to CLSI criteria, antibiotic susceptibility tests for S.putrefaciens should be done by a method which detects minimal inhibitory concentration. Second, this paper reported that S.putrefaciens was sensitive to third generation cephalosporins and penicillins. Besides, the authors suggested that susceptibility of these bacteria to these antibiotics was helpful for the differential diagnosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and S.putrefaciens. However, in the literature, S.putrefaciens had been reported as resistant to penicillin.

Thus, periodic monitoring of the susceptibility patterns of anaerobic bacteria is advisable. The aim of this study was to update on resistance of Bacteroides fragilis group in our Institution with special attention to carbapenems reporting metallo-beta-lactamase producing strains for the first time in Spain, and to compare fingerprinting analysis results obtained by using automated rep-PCR (DiversiLab System) and MALDI-TOF MS. A total of 830 non-duplicated clinical isolates of the B. fragilis group recovered from the years 2006 to 2010 were studied. B. fragilis was the most prevalent species (59.5{\%}). The total susceptibility of B. fragilis group isolates were: penicillin, 13.3{\%}; amoxicillin/clavulanic, 89.6{\%}; piperacillin-tazobactam, 91.8{\%}; cefoxitin, 65.8{\%}; ertapenem, 95.9{\%}; imipenem, 98.2{\%}; clindamycin, 53.4{\%} and metronidazole, 96.4{\%}. The percentage of sensitive isolates did not change significantly over time for amoxicillin/clavulanic, cefoxitin, clindamycin and metronidazole. A slight increase in the rate of resistance to ertapenem and imipenem was observed. Imipenem resistance and carbapenemase production were detected for the first time in our laboratory in the year 2007. No other report of carbapenemase-producing B. fragilis in our country has been previously published. Six imipenem-resistant isolates were MBL-producing and PCR positive for cfiA gene. Four of them were PCR positive for IS-like immediately upstream cfiA gene and two of them were negative. Both, automated rep-PCR (DiversiLab) and MALDI-TOF MS, revealed a great genetic diversity among carbapenem-producing strains suggesting the acquisition of novel resistance genes more than clonal dissemination of them. Both methods seem to be useful tools for fast and accurate identification and strain typing of B. fragilis group in the daily laboratory routine.

21150,MAYBE,Tsakris2009,Article,"During a 3-year period (May 2005 to April 2008), a series of 45 outpatients presented with community-onset urinary tract infections due to carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. Forty of them had a history of previous hospitalization or exposure to healthcare facilities, while the remaining five had not been previously admitted to our healthcare facilities or elsewhere within the preceding 12 months. In 18 outpatients, the carbapenem-resistant organisms caused recurrent community-onset urinary tract infections, while in three outpatients the organisms were also implicated in bacteremic episodes. All 45 single-patient P. aeruginosa isolates harbored the blaVIM-2 metallo-$\beta$-lactamase (MBL) gene in a common class 1 integron structure. They belonged to one predominant pulsed-field gel electrophoresis type and three sporadically detected types; two of the sporadic clonal types were identified among outpatients without previous exposure to healthcare facilities, while the predominant clonal type was also identified to cause infections in hospitalized patients. This is the first study documenting that MBL-producing P. aeruginosa isolates cause community-onset infections that are related or not with exposure to healthcare facilities. Community-onset infections in our patients most likely resulted from the nosocomial acquisition of MBL producers, followed by a prolonged digestive carriage. The high rate of recurrent infections in the community underlies the difficulty of constraining infections caused by such microorganisms in the extrahospital setting.

Methods: We characterized vancomycin-resistant E. faecium isolates from 10 infected and 40 colonized inpatients from a single hospital by PFGE, multiple-locus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Genes encoding antibiotic resistance (ampicillin, aminoglycosides, macrolides, quinupristin/dalfopristin, quinolones, tetracycline) and putative virulence traits were analysed. Results: All isolates showed highly similar PFGE profiles and were assigned to the type MT1 by MLVA and to ST17 (CC17) by MLST. The Tn 5382 type identified in all isolates was linked to pbp5 and contained a 5 bp deletion and 10 point mutations within the intergenic vanSB -vanYB region. Other resistance genes identified were erm (B), mef (E), tet (M), ant(6′)-Ia, aph(3′)-IIIa and aac(6′)-Ie-aph(2″)-Ia. All isolates carried the unexpressed tet (M) gene. The high level of ciprofloxacin resistance was attributable to the first described Gly-61 and Ile-80 mutations in ParC and the Tyr-83 or Arg-83 mutations in GyrA. All isolates contained esp. The presence of hyl was variable. Conclusions: A large clonal outbreak caused by multidrug-resistant CC17 E. faecium containing pbp5-Tn 5382 is described. The persistence of this clone, which has been recovered from both hospital and community settings since 2005, and the possibility of transferring this Tn 5382 to other epidemic ampicillin-resistant clonal types currently circulating in Spain might contribute to increasing the prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in our area. This study constitutes the first description of mef (E) in E. faecium. {\textcopyright} The Author 2008.

21835,MAYBE,Vicente2010,Article,"Objectives: Isolation of catalase-negative Staphylococcus aureus (CNSA) from cases of human infection has occasionally been reported. We report a case of endocarditis and meningitis in which methicillin- resistant CNSA was isolated from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood and, probably, from the prosthetic aortic valve. Methods: Case report and review of the English and Spanish medical literature. Results: On 7 September 2009, a 67-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for fever, chills, vomiting, rigor and confusion. She had underwent mitral and aortic valves replacement two months before. For suspected central nervous system infection a lumbar puncture was performed. CSF showed 92 leucocites/mm3 (74{\%} PMN), proteins 0.85 g/L and glucose 98 mg/dL. She was started on vancomycin and meropenem therapy. On hospital day 3, she began with signs of heart failure. Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showed multiple vegetations on mitral valve, periprosthetic abscess and severe periprosthetic mitral regurgitation. At this time, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was isolated from blood and CSF cultures, so treatment was changed to vancomycin, gentamicin and rifampin. She underwent aortic and mitral prosthetic valves replacement. An external laboratory reported us the isolation of MRSA from the prosthetic aortic valve. She presented multiorganic failure with renal insufficiency and vancomycin was changed to linezolid. After six weeks with antibiotics, a new TEE showed new vegetations and periprosthetic mitral valve regurgitation, so new cardiac surgery was performed. S. aureus isolated from blood and CSF was repeatedly catalase negative. Reference laboratory reported that both strains belonged to the same mixed phage group. We have found other 25 documented cases of CNSA human infection or colonization. Most cases came from Europe (13/26). Patients were predominantly male (15/25), with a mean age of 53 years (range, 1-80) and frecuently had underlying conditions. Six out of 16 reported autcomes were fatal. The most frecuent culture sources were blood (12/25) and wound or soft tissue samples (10/25). Seven out of20 strains were methicillin-resistant. Conclusion: This is the first report of CNSA meningitis and the first report of methicillin-resistant CNSA human infection in Spain.

22218,MAYBE,Wang2012m,Article,"Eighteen out of 45 children were reported to have a respiratory illness during an outbreak at a temporary dormitory in a nursery school in China in 2011. To study the outbreak and to determine the risk factors for infection, an epidemiological investigation was performed. A standardized questionnaire was completed for a total of 45 children with the help of their guardians and parents. In addition, acute- and convalescent-phase serum samples and throat swabs from the children were taken for laboratory diagnosis. The diagnosis of a Mycoplasma-like illness was based on the following clinical criteria. The criteria were onset of illness after 31 May 2011, characterized by a cough, fever({\textgreater}37.5 degrees C), or at least 3 of the following symptoms: fever, sore throat, cough or expectoration, and runny or stuffy nose. PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), determination of MICs, and sequencing were performed to determine the genotype, antibiotic resistance, and sequence polymorphisms of the isolated strains, respectively. The paired sera revealed that 15 patients were infected with Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Epidemiology confirmed that this was a point source outbreak, characterized by a short incubation period, a high secondary attack rate, and a long period of hospitalization. PCR-RFLP analysis revealed that the 12 isolated strains of M. pneumoniae shared the same subtype P1 gene, and 23S rRNA sequence analysis showed that these strains harbored two macrolide-resistant gene-related point mutations at position 2063 and 2617. In this outbreak, the major risk factor was the distance between the bed of the first patient and the beds of close contacts (beds less than three meters apart). The strains isolated in this study were found to harbor two point mutations conferring macrolide resistance, indicating the importance of pathogen and drug resistance surveillance systems.",Y Wang and S Qiu and G Yang and L Song and W Su and Y Xu and L Jia and L Wang and R Hao and C Zhang and J Liu and X Fu and J He and J Zhang and Z Li and H Song,"0066-4804

22400,MAYBE,Wendt2010,Article,"We report the first outbreak of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing K. pneumoniae in Germany. The presence of KPC was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The KPC-encoding plasmid was analysed by transconjugation experiments, DNA sequencing, Southern blotting and isoelectric focussing. Typing was performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). An ertapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae with low minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) to other cabapenems (tested by the Vitek system) was isolated from the index patient in January 2008. A KPC-2 was identified after K. pneumoniae with identical susceptibility patterns had been isolated from two more patients. Despite the introduction of infection control measures, transmission occurred in five additional patients and three of the patients died from infections. The source of the outbreak strain remained unclear; however, the Tn4401-containing bla KPC-2 gene was similar to previously described isolates from Greece. Five months after the end of the outbreak, a KPC-K. pneumoniae was isolated from a patient who had been treated in Greece previously. Retrospectively, this patient was treated in November 2007 on the same unit as the index case. Typing revealed that all patients were colonised by the same strain. KPC-K. pneumoniae has been introduced to Germany possibly from Greece and transmission to other institutions is likely. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.",C Wendt and S Schutt and A H Dalpke and M Konrad and M Mieth and B Trierweiler-Hauke and M A Weigand and S Zimmermann and K Biehler and D Jonas and S Schütt and A H Dalpke and M Konrad and M Mieth and B Trierweiler-Hauke and M A Weigand and S Zimmermann and K Biehler and D Jonas,0934-9723,Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,",*Disease Outbreaks,Adult,Aged,Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology,Bacterial Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics,DNA sequence,Electrophoresis,Escherichia coli,Female,Gel,Germany,Germany/epidemiology,Greece,Humans,Klebsiella Infections/drug therapy/*epidemiology/*,Klebsiella pneumoniae infection,Klebsiella pneumoniae/drug effects/*enzymology/gen,Male,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Middle Aged,Polymerase Chain Reaction,Pulsed-Field,Southern blotting,adult,aged,amoxicillin,ampicillin,antibiotic resistance,article,bacterial colonization,bacterial transmission,bacterium identification,bacterium isolation,beta-Lactam Resistance,beta-Lactamases/*biosynthesis/genetics,carbapenem,carbapenemase,cefotaxime,cefpodoxime,ceftazidime,ciprofloxacin,clavulanic acid,colistin,controlled study,cotrimoxazole,epidemic,ertapenem,female,gentamicin,human,imipenem,infection control,isoelectric focusing,major clinical study,male,meropenem,minimum inhibitory concentration,moxifloxacin,nonhuman,nucleotide sequence,piperacillin,piperacillin plus tazobactam,plasmid,polymerase chain reaction,priority journal,pulsed field gel electrophoresis,tetracycline,tigecycline,tobramycin",563--570,{First outbreak of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing K. pneumoniae in Germany},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L50823130 http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10096-010-0896-0 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=09349723{\&}id=doi:10.1007{\%}2Fs10096-010-0896-0{\&}atitle=First+outbreak+,29,2010,5,"From Duplicate 2 (First outbreak of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing K. pneumoniae in Germany - Wendt, C; Schutt, S; Dalpke, A H; Konrad, M; Mieth, M; Trierweiler-Hauke, B; Weigand, M A; Zimmermann, S; Biehler, K; Jonas, D)

Study design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: An elementary school and five hospitals in Chengdu in southwest China. Results: There were 1,134 students in the school. 937 (82.6{\%}) students had signs and symptoms. Of the 568 (60.6{\%}, 568/937) hospitalized students, 93.3{\%} 86.8{\%}, 72.4{\%}, and 28.9{\%} of the hospitalized patients had diarrhea, fever, abdominal pain, and vomiting, respectively. S. sonnei strains were isolated from the stool samples of 36.0{\%} (337/937) students. All of the outbreak isolates had the same high-level antimicrobial resistance and plasmid profiles, which were different from that of sporadic strains. All the outbreak S. sonnei isolates were positive for the integrin gene and contained class 2 integron; however, two outbreak isolates contained class 1 and class 2 integrons.

RMP-enhanced tubercle bacilli that grew poorly without RMP but grew better in its presence were isolated from the patient with treatment failure. The bacteria grown without RMP consisted of mixed morphologies of short rod-shaped acid-fast bacteria and poorly stained coccoid bacteria, but stained normally as acid-fast rods when grown in the presence of RMP. The isolated RMP-enhanced bacteria harbored the common S531L mutation and a novel mutation F584S in the rpoB gene. Treatment containing RMP or replacement of RMP with more powerful rifapentine paradoxically aggravated the disease, but its removal led to successful cure of the patient. This study highlights the potential dangers of continued treatment of MDR-TB with rifamycins that can occur due to delayed or absent drug susceptibility results and calls for timely detection of RMP-dependent/-enhanced bacteria in treatment failure patients by including RMP in culture media and removal of RMP from treatment regimen upon detection.",M Zhong and X Zhang and Y Wang and C Zhang and G Chen and P Hu and M Li and B Zhu and W Zhang and Y Zhang,1027-3719,Int J Tuberc Lung Dis,"Adult,Antibiotics, Antitubercular/*pharmacology,Bacterial Proteins/genetics,DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases,Humans,Male,Mutation,Mycobacterium tuberculosis/drug effects/genetics,Rifampin/*analogs {\&} derivatives/pharmacology,Treatment Failure,Tuberculosis, Multidrug-Resistant/*drug therapy/mi",40--44,{An interesting case of rifampicin-dependent/-enhanced multidrug-resistant tuberculosis},NA,14,2010,1,"1815-7920

23702,MAYBE,NA:29,Article,"BACKGROUND: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the major nosocomial opportunistic pathogen, is an important cause of infectious morbidity and mortality among immunocompromised patients. OBJECTIVE: To establish the role of metallo-beta-lactamases (MBL) and efflux-mediated mechanisms in confer- ring carbapenem resistance in nosocomial isolates of P. aeruginosa. METHODS: We analyzed carbapenem nonsusceptible nosocomial P. aeruginosa isolates obtained from pediatric and adult patients at three hospitals in Moscow in 2012-2015. Carbapenem susceptibility was assessed using the E-test. In addition, minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of meropenem were tested by the broth microdilution method. The presence of MBL was determined using the ED TA-mediated suppression test. Efflux-dependent resistance was measured using an assay based on MIC modification by an ionophore carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenyl hydrazine (CCCP). RESULTS: A total of 54 carbapenem nonsusceptible P. aeruginosa isolates was examined. The presence of an MBL was detected in 37 (69{\%}) isolates, 29 (54{\%}) isolates had efflux-mediated resistance. In 10 (19{\%}) isolates neither MBL nor efflux activity was found. Five out of 6 isolates (83{\%}) with highly active efflux were MBL-positive. Among isolates with low efflux activity, 74{\%} (17/23) possessed MBL, whereas in isolates with no efflux the rate of MBL-positivity was 60{\%} (15/25). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of MBL- and efflux-mediated carbapenem resistance in nosocomial P. aeruginosa is high. Moreover, our results reveal that several resistance mechanisms may combine at the isolate level. These data may contribute to the development of novel strategies in combating carbapenem resistance.",NA,"0869-6047 (Print)
