23579,MAYBE,Zielinska-Borkowska2010,Article,"BACKGROUND: Intensive therapy units are the places where pathogens can easily spread. Improper antibiotic therapy contributes to the selection of new strains called multidrug-resistant, extensively drug-resistant or pandrug-resistant. For ITU patients, such pathogens are particularly dangerous. CASE REPORT: The case of a 50-year-old man diagnosed with septic shock after repeated surgeries due to Vater's ampulla tumour was described. In blood and peritoneal fluid cultures, Enterobacter cloacae ESBL and Klebsiella pneumoniae were first isolated; then Acinetobacter baumannii was also detected. The targeted antibiotic therapy instituted did not bring the expected results. On day 5, tigecycline and imipenem were started and continued over 10 days. After 4 days of combined therapy, bacterial strains were eradicated. The patient was sent to the referring ward in good condition. CONCLUSION: Combined use of imipenem and a new antibiotic - tigecycline provides effective treatment of septic shock in the course of intra-abdominal infection.",U Zieli√Ö¬Ñska-Borkowska and M Z√Ö¬Çotorowicz and U Zielinska-Borkowska and M Zlotorowicz,"0209-1712 (Print)

2963,MAYBE,Caltagirone2015,Article,"A 62-year-old patient was transferred to the cardiac rehabilitation unit of the I.R.C.C.S. Fondazione S. Maugeri after undergoing a heart transplantation at the Acute Care Hospital I.R.C.C.S. S. Matteo of Pavia. On 1 August 2013 and during hospitalization in the rehabilitation unit, Klebsiella oxytoca and Citrobacter koseri clinical isolates were simultaneously recovered from the patient's preputial swab. Both the K. oxytoca and C. koseri strains were carbapenem- resistant by MicroScan System (Beckman Coulter). Carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae had previously been reported in the same rehabilitation facility. The aim of the study was to identify the carbapenem resistance mechanisms among the enterobacterial species recovered. Phenotypic screening tests useful to detect the beta-lactamases/carbapenemases were performed. Carbapenem MICs were obtained by Etest. AmpC and MBL encoding genes were identified by PCR and sequencing. Conjugation assays and plasmid characterization were performed. Both of the K. oxytoca and C. koseri isolates were multi drug resistant, showing resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, three generation cephalosporins, ertapenem (K. oxytoca MIC, {\textgreater}32 mg/L; C. koseri MIC, 4 mg/L), imipenem (K. oxytoca MIC, 4 mg/L; C. koseri MIC, 12 mg/L), thrimethoprim sulphamethoxazole and gentamicin. Susceptibility was retained to fluoroquinolones, colistin and tigecycline. Molecular characterization confirmed the co-presence of blaCMY-4 and blaVIM-4 determinants in a 150 Kb transferable plasmid of IncA/C group. This case is the first detection in Italy of the K. oxytoca and C. koseri clinical isolates co-producing the CMY-4 and VIM-4 enzymes.",M Caltagirone and I Bitar and A Piazza and M Spalla and E Nucleo and A Navarra and R Migliavacca,"1121-7138 (Print)

3067,MAYBE,Cao2011b,Article,"A total of 222 urinary Escherichia coli isolates from 20 tertiary hospitals in 15 different provinces and 4 municipalities in mainland China were characterized by antimicrobial susceptibility, phylogrouping, and the presence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes. A subset of 138 suspected extended-spectrum cephalosporinase (ESC) producers were examined for genes encoding cephalosporin resistance. Forty-three isolates harboring bla(CTX-M-14) or bla(CTX-M-15) were analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and plasmids containing these genes were typed using PCR-based replicon typing (PBRT). Thirteen phylogroup B2 bla(CTX-M-14)- and bla(CTX-M-15)-positive isolates were analyzed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). A frequent occurrence of resistance ({\textgreater}46{\%}) was observed toward cephalosporins, gentamicin, and fluoroquinolones. Among the 222 isolates, 4 qnrS1, 4 qepA, and 16 aac(6')-Ib-cr genes were confirmed. Four major phylogroups (A, B1, B2, and D) and nontypeable isolates (NTs) were found among the isolates, with phylogroup D (54{\%}) being the most common phylogroup. A total of 110 (80{\%}) of the 138 screened isolates harbored bla(CTX-M) genes, with bla(CTX-M-14) (71{\%}) and bla(CTX-M-15) (24{\%}) being the most prevalent of these genes. Nine of the 13 CTX-M-15- or CTX-M-14-containing B2 isolates belonged to ST131. PFGE typing showed a high level of diversity, and plasmid analysis indicated a very large pool of different resistance plasmids mediating the spread of bla(CTX-M) genes in mainland China. An equally very high frequency of resistance and equally high levels of diversity in phylogroups, PFGE types, and plasmids were observed among community- and hospital-acquired E. coli isolates, indicating the presence of a large reservoir in the community and a long-term spread of cephalosporin resistance in China.",X Cao and L M Cavaco and Y Lv and Y Li and B Zheng and P Wang and H Hasman and Y Liu and F M Aarestrup,0095-1137,J Clin Microbiol,"*Molecular Typing,Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology,China,Cluster Analysis,Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field,Escherichia coli Infections/*microbiology,Escherichia coli/*classification/*drug effects/iso,Genetic Variation,Genotype,Hospitals,Humans,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Multilocus Sequence Typing,Plasmids/analysis,Polymerase Chain Reaction,Urinary Tract Infections/*microbiology,beta-Lactamases/biosynthesis/genetics",2496--2501,{Molecular characterization and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of Escherichia coli isolates from patients with urinary tract infections in 20 Chinese hospitals},NA,49,2011,7,"1098-660x

9010,MAYBE,Hu2013,Article,"The emergence of NDM-1 has become established as a major public health threat and represents a new and major challenge in the treatment of infectious diseases. A total of 39 carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates collected from patients receiving care at 5 teaching hospitals in Jiangxi province, central China, were analyzed for carriage of resistance genes, including blaNDM-1. Two carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates (NC12 and NC18) were found to harbor blaNDM-1. In addition to blaNDM-1, NC12 also carried blaSHV-1, while NC18 harbored additional resistance genes, including blaSHV-12, blaCTX-M-14, armA and blaTEM-1. NC12 and NC18 belonged to ST15 and novel ST1031 and were clonally unrelated. Carbapenem resistance for NC12 could be transferred to Escherichia coli recipients through conjugation and chemical transformation, while carbapenem resistance for NC18 was only transferred to E. coli recipients by chemical transformation. The EcoR1-digested DNA pattern of plasmids from the transformants of NC12 was identical to that for NC18. Taken together, this is the first report of blaNDM-1 carriage by K. pneumoniae clinical isolates in mainland China, indicating that blaNDM-1 is disseminated among Enterobacteriaceae in China. Systemic surveillance should focus on the dissemination of blaNDM-1 among Gram-negative clinical isolates, especially some major clones, such as K. pneumoniae ST15 which is a major clone among CTX-M-15-producing isolates. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.",L Hu and Q Zhong and J Tu and Y Xu and Z Qin and C Parsons and B Zhang and X Hu and L Wang and F Yu and J Pan,0732-8893,Diagnostic Microbiology and Infectious Disease,",*Molecular Typing,80 and over,Aged,Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology,Bacterial,Carbapenems/pharmacology,China,China/epidemiology,Conjugation,Escherichia coli,Gene Transfer,Genetic,Genotype,Horizontal,Hospitals,Humans,Klebsiella Infections/epidemiology/*microbiology,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Klebsiella pneumoniae infection,Klebsiella pneumoniae/*classification/*enzymology/,Male,Teaching,Transformation,Young Adult,adult,aged,amikacin,ampicillin,antibiotic resistance,antibiotic sensitivity,article,aztreonam,bacterial gene,bacterium isolate,bacterium transformation,beta lactamase,beta lactamase NDM 1,beta lactamase SHV 1,beta lactamase SHV 12,beta lactamase TEM 1,beta lactamase ctx m 14,beta-Lactam Resistance,beta-Lactamases/*secretion,carbapenem,case report,cefepime,cefotaxime,cefoxitin,ceftazidime,ceftriaxone,ciprofloxacin,conjugation,cotrimoxazole,fosfomycin,gentamicin,human,imipenem,levofloxacin,linezolid,male,meropenem,methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus,minimum inhibitory concentration,nonhuman,piperacillin,piperacillin plus tazobactam,polymyxin B,priority journal,purification,teicoplanin,tigecycline,unclassified drug",373--376,{Emergence of blaNDM-1 among Klebsiella pneumoniae ST15 and novel ST1031 clinical isolates in China},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L52466920 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2013.01.006 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=07328893{\&}id=doi:10.1016{\%}2Fj.diagmicrobio.2013.01.006{\&}atit,75,2013,4,"From Duplicate 2 (Emergence of blaNDM-1 among Klebsiella pneumoniae ST15 and novel ST1031 clinical isolates in China - Hu, L; Zhong, Q; Tu, J; Xu, Y; Qin, Z; Parsons, C; Zhang, B; Hu, X; Wang, L; Yu, F; Pan, J)

This organism has been detected worldwide in adult and paediatric patients since the first description in 1986, with the first laboratory detection in South Africa in 1993. VRE were isolated, identified and their antimicrobial susceptibility profiles determined using the Vitek 2 system, from February-November 2013. Vancomycin MIC's were determined using the Etest method. Isolates were screened for the vanA/B/C genes with conventional PCR. Positive isolates were compared using pulsedfield gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Two patients with blood stream infections (BSI) cultured VRE, two days apart, in February 2013, at Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital. This was the first incidence of VRE at this facility and indicated the possibility of an outbreak. Active surveillance and heightened infection control were instituted to limit spread. 29 patients were subsequently screened for colonization with VRE, of which 2 were positive. In September and November 2013, 2 additional VRE were obtained from two patients with BSI's. Screening Results of 26 patients revealed 6 colonized patients. PCR Results indicated that all the VRE isolated possessed the vanA gene, which confers high-level resistance to glycopepetides. PFGE Results indicated a high level of genetic diversity between all the isolates. The initial 2 isolates shared high levels of genetic relatedness (92.5{\%}), indicating likely patient-to-patient transmission of the same clone. A second isolate from patient 2 shared 97.9{\%} homology with the isolate from patient 3. Two isolates from patient 4 had low homology with each other (61.1{\%}) and very low homology with other strains tested. Five of the screening isolates shared high levels of relatedness (?90{\%}) indicating possible spread during the outbreak. An outbreak of VRE in a paediatric hospital was detected.

We have also observed a similar occurrence in our study involving colistin resistance from several countries along with a similar phenomenon being reported by researchers. The observation of colistin resistance in humans without prior colistin exposure is of particularly great clinical importance and concern because of the current importance of colistin in clinical medicine. Colistin use and colistin-resistant bacteria in animals have been recently reported, suggesting that animals could also be a source of transmission of colistin-resistant bacteria to humans.

This report describes the first KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates identified in Norway (n=6) and the second isolate from Sweden. METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility profiles were determined using Etest. PCR and sequencing were used to determine the bla(KPC) variant, the surrounding genetic structure and the presence of AmpC and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase genes. PFGE and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) were used for epidemiological comparisons. Localization of bla(KPC) was investigated by S1 nuclease digestion, followed by PFGE and Southern blot hybridization. RESULTS: All isolates expressed a multidrug-resistant phenotype with some variability in the carbapenem susceptibility profile. The Norwegian isolates carried bla(KPC-2), while the Swedish isolate carried bla(KPC-3). All isolates carried TEM-1, but were negative for bla(CTX-M) and bla(AmpC) genes. SHV-11 and SHV-12 were detected in the Norwegian isolates, while the Swedish isolate carried only SHV-11. Isolates from four patients were associated with import from Greece (n=3) and Israel. The other isolates were probably associated with local transmissions. PFGE and MLST showed that the isolates were clonally related, with three isolates displaying ST258, a single locus variant of ST11 previously associated with the clonal spread of CTX-M-15-producing K. pneumoniae in Hungary. In all isolates, bla(KPC) was located on plasmids as part of isoform a of Tn4401. CONCLUSIONS: The emergence of KPC-producing isolates of K. pneumoniae in Norway and Sweden is associated with multiple import events and probable local transmission of a successful multiresistant ST258 clone, closely related to the CTX-M-15-producing ST11 clone previously described in Hungary.",O Samuelsen and U Naseer and S Tofteland and D H Skutlaberg and A Onken and R Hjetland and A Sundsfjord and C G Giske and √å√∑ Samuelsen and U Naseer and S Tofteland and D H Skutlaberg and A Onken and R Hjetland and A Sundsfjord and C G Giske,"0305-7453
