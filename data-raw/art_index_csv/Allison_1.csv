The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of PVL-positive (PVL(+))-MRSA strains in Western Austria in the period from December 2005 to May 2010 and to characterize the identified PVL(+)-MRSA strains. METHODS: Six hundred and fifty MRSA strains from Innsbruck Medical University hospital, district hospitals, and general practitioners were investigated for the presence of lukS-lukF gene (encoding for PVL). Antimicrobial resistance testing, SCCmec-, agr-, MLST- and spa-typing, as well as arcA determination were performed on PVL(+)-MRSA. RESULTS: Among 650 MRSA strains collected from various body sites from hospitalized patients and outpatients, 31 strains (4.8 {\%}) were positive for lukS-lukF and thus identified as PVL(+)-MRSA. Agr-1 was the most common agr-type (n = 18, 58.1 {\%}) and SCCmec-IV or variants IVa and IVc were the most common SCCmec types (n = 27, 87.1 {\%}). All tested strains showed in-vitro susceptibility to vancomycin and rifampicin, but resistance against cotrimoxazol (6.4 {\%}), clindamycin (9.7 {\%}), gentamicin (9.7 {\%}), fusidic acid (12.9 {\%}), levofloxacin (12.9 {\%}), and erythromycin (61.3 {\%}) was found. Most lukS-lukF-positive MRSA detected in our survey shared ST8 and t008 and were positive for arcA. CONCLUSIONS: The major lukS-lukF-positive MRSA lineage found in our population was ST8, t008 and positive for arcA which is mainly found in the USA.

The widespread emergence of multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae is a major public health concerns. $\beta$-lactams are the antibiotics most widely used all over the world, have also given rise to a continuous increase of resistance and driven diversification of the resistance and driven diversification of the resistance mechanisms.Various $\beta$-lactamases have been identified to hydrolyze $\beta$-lactams. The extended-spectrum $\beta$-lactamases, such as CTX-M and SHV, hydrolyze cephalosporins and monobactams; whereas K. pneumoniae carbapenemases (KPCs) confer carbapenem resistance. Many $\beta$-lactamase genes reside in plasmids, transferring between different stains or species. Methods: Routine clinical MicroScan and Etest methods were used to profile the susceptibility of antimicrobial resistance in K. pneumoniae clinical isolates recovered from patient specimens during 2005-2014. Additional PCR amplification followed by Sanger sequencing was used for gene detection of blaCTX-M and blaKPC. A combination of short- and long-read whole genome sequencing was used for three isolates positive to both blaCTXM and blaKPC. Comparative genomic analyses were further conducted to characterize detailed resistance gene structures and genomic features. Results: We identified three K. pneumoniae isolates, CN1, CR14 and NY9, carrying both blaCTXM and blaKPC. Through de novo assembly, we obtained three complete genomes. In CR14 and NY9, blaCTX-M and blaKPC were carried in distinctive plasmids with distinctive incompatibility. In contrast, CN1 harbors in chromosome one blaKPC-2 and three blaCTX-M-15 genes, in addition to one blaSHV-11. Whereas blaCTX-M-15 genes were transferred via the same insertion sequence ISEcp1, blaKPC-2 gene was mobilized in the context of insertion sequence Tn4401a, which was found conjugative with a PsP3-like prophage in CN1 chromosome. Intriguingly, downstream of the newly generated Tn4401a-prophage genomic island, CN1 carried a CRISPR-Cas array with four spacers targeting a variety of K. pneumoniae plasmids carrying antimicrobial resistance genes. It suggests the evolving CRISPR-Cas, a bacterial immune system preventing phage infection and plasmid transfer, might have induced the mobilization of resistance genes from plasmids into chromosome under the selective force. Conclusion: We observed the emergence of K. pneumoniae isolates carrying multiple choromosomal $\beta$-lactamase genes. Our comparative genomic analyses revealed their shared genomic features and dynamic evolutionary events occurring in choromosome.The dissemination of $\beta$-lactam resistance from plasmids to chromosome depicts the currently complex pandemic scenario of multidrug resistant K. pneumoniae isolates.",W Huang and G Wang and R Sebra and J Zhuge and C Yin and M E Aguero-Rosenfeld and A N Schuetz and N Dimitrova and J T Fallon,1943-7811,Journal of Molecular Diagnostics,"DNA flanking region,Klebsiella pneumoniae,antibiotic resistance,beta lactamase,chromosome,clinical study,clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic,disease carrier,drug resistance,endogenous compound,epsilometer test,gene amplification,gene insertion sequence,genomic island,human,human tissue,immune system,infection,nonhuman,pandemic,plasmid,polymerase chain reaction,prevention,prophage,species,stain",981,{Emergence of multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae carrying multiple chromosomal beta-lactamase genes},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L613102131 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=19437811{\&}id=doi:{\&}atitle=Emergence+of+multidrug-resistant+Klebsiella+pneumoniae+carrying+multiple+chromosomal+,18,2016,6,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,MAYBE,Brooke,YES,Ayomide,Ayomide,Allison_1,23155,MAYBE,Young2009,Article,"Objectives: To report a series of patients with sepsis due to fluoroquinolone-resistant Escherichia coli after prostate needle biopsy across 4 hospitals in southern California.

The two Hong Kong strains were isolated from a 48-year-old man with intestinal obstruction and secondary sepsis (strain HKU16T) and from a 39-year-old man with acute appendicitis (strain HKU17), while the two Canadian strains were isolated from a 74-year-old man with biliary sepsis (strain CA1) and from a 66-year-old woman with metastatic carcinoma and sepsis (strain CA2). While the first three patients survived, the last patient died 2 weeks after the episode of bacteremia. All four isolates are strictly anaerobic, nonsporulating, gram-positive coccobacilli that were unidentified by conventional phenotypic tests and commercial identification systems. They grow on sheep blood agar as nonhemolytic pinpoint colonies after 48 h of incubation at 37å¡C in an anaerobic environment. All are catalase positive and motile, with flagella. They produce acid from arabinose, glucose, mannose, and xylose. They do not produce indole or reduce nitrate. They are sensitive to penicillin, vancomycin, and metronidazole but resistant to cefotaxime. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed 16.0{\%}, 16.8{\%}, and 21.0{\%} base differences from Clostridium propionicum, Clostridium neopropionicum, and Atopobium minutum, respectively.

Based on their phylogenetic affiliation, unique G+C content, and phenotypic characteristics, we propose a new genus and species, Catabacter hongkongensis gen. nov., sp. nov., to describe the bacterium, for which HKU16 is the type strain, and suggest that it be assigned to a new family, Catabacteriaceae. The gastrointestinal tract was probably the source of the bacterium for at least three of the four patients.

Methods: We assessed the prevalence, susceptibility patterns, clinical outcome and genetic relatedness of enterococcal isolates causing bloodstream infections in children in a tertiary hospital in Tanzania, as part of a prospective cohort study of bloodstream infections among 1828 febrile children admitted consecutively from August 2001 to August 2002. Results: Enterococcal bacteraemia was identified in 2.1{\%} (39/1828) of admissions, and in 15.3{\%} (39/255) of cases of culture-confirmed bloodstream infections. The case-fatality rate in children with Enterococcus faecalis septicaemia (28.6{\%}, 4/14) was not significantly different from those with Enterococcus faecium septicaemia (6.7{\%}, 1/15, p = 0.12). E. faecium isolates commonly had combined ampicillin-resistance and high-level gentamicin resistance (HLGR), (9/17), while E. faecalis frequently displayed HLGR (6/15), but were ampicillin susceptible. None of the tested enterococcal isolates displayed vancomycin resistance by Etest or PCR for vanA and vanB genes. Multi-locus sequence-typing (MLST) showed that the majority of E. faecium (7/12) belonged to the hospital associated Bayesian Analysis of Population Structure (BAPS) group 3-3. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) indicated close genetic relationship particularly among E. faecium isolates, but also among E. faecalis isolates. There was also correlation between BAPS group and PFGE results. Risk factors for enterococcal bloodstream infection in univariate analysis were hospital-acquired infection and clinical diagnosis of sepsis with unknown focus. In multivariate analysis, neonates in general were relatively protected from enterococcal infection, while both prematurity and clinical sepsis were risk factors. Malnutrition was a risk factor for enterococcal bloodstream infection among HIV negative children. Conclusion: This is the first study to describe bloodstream infections caused by ampicillin-resistant HLGR E. faecium and HLGR E. faecalis in Tanzania. The isolates of E. faecium and E. faecalis, respectively, showed high degrees of relatedness by genotyping using PFGE. The commonly used treatment regimens at the hospital are insufficient for infections caused by these microbes.

Community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) has been associated with virulent strains producing Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) and a variety of other exotoxins. In Geneva, PVL-producing CA-MRSA was first reported in 2002 and a surveillance system based on voluntary reporting was set up. Each MRSA-positive culture result with an antibiotic resistance profile different from the endemic strain prevailing in the Geneva healthcare setting diagnosed in a patient without a history of hospital admission in the previous 12 months was notified to the local health department. A questionnaire was completed by the attending physician with demographic, clinical and exposure information. From January 2002 until December 2004, data on 58 cases were reported, including 26 cases grouped in 13 distinct transmission clusters. Most were family related and for two of them, colonisation persisted over a 12 month period despite treatment. Thirty three patients (57{\%}) were male. Median age was 32 years, 22{\%} being younger than 10 years. Forty one cases (71{\%}) were infected and 17 (29{\%}) colonised. Symptomatic skin lesions such as furunculosis, impetigo or abscess were present in 40 (97{\%}) of the 41 infected cases. Most cases had no underlying disease. Thirty eight cases (65{\%}) had travelled abroad. Forty (69{\%}) of 58 isolates carried the PVL toxin. CA-MRSA infections in Geneva appear to be an emerging problem in the canton. Surveillance should continue and should possibly be extended to other parts of the country to better describe transmission patterns and the spread of this pathogen.

Reasons for this include the prolonged survival of severely ill and immunocompromised patients, the development of more invasive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and the sub-optimal use of antibiotics that disrupts normal microbial balance and favors superinfections. Case Report: We present a rare case of sepsis due to multidrug-resistant Corynebacterium striatum in a 76-year-old host. The patient suffered from myelodysplastic syndrome and was on corticosteroid treatment due to atopic dermatitis. He had, also, a recent hospital admission and received a course of broad-spectrum antibiotics due to lower respiratory infection. The patient responded neither to empiric nor to targeted treatment and finally succumbed. Conclusion: Diphtheroids are emerging pathogens capable of causing severe opportunistic infections.

The patient had been transferred from another hospital of a neighbouring country after 5 days of hospitalization due to a car accident. The clinical history mentioned antibiotic treatment not including carbapenems (gentamicine, metronidazole and ceftriaxone), and no link to India or Pakistan. We investigated the carbapenem resistance mechanism. Materials and Methods: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by both Vitek2 and microdiluition, and interpreted according to the latest EUCAST documents. The presence of a carbapenemase was investigated by means of an MBL-etest, hydrolysis of carbapenems and EDTA inhibition of hydrolysis. PCR and sequencing were carried out by standard procedures. Resistance was transferred by conjugation to E. coli J53. Results: The strain was resistant to imipenem and meropenem (MICs 16 mg/L and 64 mg/L, respectively), and to all 3G-cephalosporins (MICs{\textgreater}128 mg/L), and susceptible to ciprofloxacin (MIC 0.25 mg/L) It also harboured a qnrA and a ctx-m-15 genes. The presence of an MBL was suggested by the MBL Etest and confirmed spectrophotometric by EDTA-inhibited imipenem hydrolysis. PCR performed by using primers specific for blaIMP, blaVIM, blaSPM, blaGIM, and blaSIM, did not yield any product. A product obtained with NDM primers was confirmed, after sequencing, to code for an NDM-1 enzyme. The resistance to carbapenems and 3G-cephalosporins was transferred to E. coli J53 by conjugation. Conclusions: To our knowledge this is the first report of an NDM-1- producing K. pneumoniae in Croatia and in the Balkans. The patient had no apparent link to the Indian subcontinent and the strain was isolated before the recent outbreak of NDM-1 producing Enterobacteriaceae. Although several cases reported by a recent pan-European survey showed a clear link to the Balkan region, this is the first documented report of NDM-1 from that area, thus confirming a possible multifocal spread of this enzyme and prompting for a widespread epidemiological surveillance.",A Mazzariol and Z Bosnjak and P Ballarini and A Budimir and B Bedenic and S Kalenic and G Cornaglia,1198-743X,Clinical Microbiology and Infection,"Croatia,Enterobacteriaceae,Escherichia coli,India,Indian,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Pakistan,antibiotic sensitivity,antibiotic therapy,blood culture,carbapenem,carbapenem derivative,carbapenemase,ceftriaxone,cephalosporin derivative,ciprofloxacin,conjugation,edetic acid,enzyme,epsilometer test,gene,hospital,hospitalization,human,hydrolysis,imipenem,intensive care unit,male,meropenem,metronidazole,patient,penicillinase,traffic accident",S138--S139,{Klebsiella pneumoniae harbouring NDM-1 metallob-lactamase isolated in Croatia},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L70599320 http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-0691.2011.03558.x http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=1198743X{\&}id=doi:10.1111{\%}2Fj.1469-0691.2011.03558.x{\&}atitle=K,17,2011,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,YES,Jake,YES,Erica,Erica,Allison_1,137,MAYBE,Adekambi2006,Article,"A rapidly growing mycobacterium was isolated in pure culture from the sputum of a 78-year-old woman suffering from hemoptoic pneumonia.
