3068,YES,Cao2012a,Article,"Introduction: Bacterial infections of the intra-abdominal require immediate, invariably empiric antibiotic therapy. Thus, antibacterial susceptibility data among intra-abdominal infection pathogens is important to define current prevalence of resistance. Methods: During 2009-2011, a total of 902 organisms derived from intra-abdominal sources, were isolated and susceptibility tested using Kirby-Bauer (KB) method, and tested for susceptibility to antibiotics according to the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. Results: Of the 902 clinical isolates, gramnegative bacilli and gram-positive cocci accounted for 83.6{\%} and 16.4{\%} respectively. Escherichia coli was the species isolated most commonly (41.4{\%}), and 8.6{\%} of these were extended-spectrum $\beta$-lactamase (ESBL)- positive. The other common pathogens were Klebsiella pneumonia (12.3{\%}), pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.8{\%}), acinetobacter baumannii (10.3{\%}) and staphylococci (6.9{\%}). ESBLs-producing strains accounted for 56.2{\%} and 52.5{\%} of escherichia coli and klebsiella spp. respectively. Methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) accounted for 44.7{\%} and methicillin-resistant coagulase negative staphylococci accounted for 38.2{\%} in staphylococcus aureus and coagulase negative staphylococci. Overall, Carbapenems were the antibiotic most active against enterobacteriaceae for which it has breakpoints ({\textgreater}96.6{\%}) followed by amikacin (91.0{\%}), and piperacillin-tazobactam (89.3{\%}), whereas rates of resistance to ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin were documented to be 29.7{\%}, 23.6{\%}, 21.5{\%}, and 20.1{\%}, respectively. Vancomycin was the most potent antimicrobial against gram positive cocci. Amphotericin B was the most active antibiotic against fungi. No vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus. aureus (VISA) or Vancomycinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA) isolate was found. Conclusions: This study documented substantial resistance to standard antimicrobial therapy among bacterial commonly isolated from intraabdominal infection in Northeast China.

Here we describe the first case of M. xenopi pulmonary disease in Korea. A 66-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with a 2-month history of productive cough and hemoptysis. His past medical history included pulmonary tuberculosis 44 years earlier, leading to a right upper lobectomy Chest X-ray upon admission revealed cavitary consolidation involving the entire right lung. Numerous acid-fast bacilli were seen in his initial sputum, and M. xenopi was subsequently identified in more than five sputum cultures, using molecular methods. Despite treatment with clarithromycin, rifampicin, ethambutol, and streptomycin, the infiltrative shadow revealed on chest X-ray increased in size. The patient's condition worsened, and a right completion pneumonectomy was performed. The patient consequently died of respiratory failure on postoperative day 47, secondary to the development of a late bronchopleural fistula.

869,YES,Antoniadou2007,Article,"OBJECTIVES: Infections due to multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative pathogens in the ICU have prompted the use of colistin, an antibiotic forgotten for decades. The aim of this retrospective observational study was to record and present the emergence of colistin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKB) in a Greek ICU. METHODS: In a new university tertiary hospital, the first patients admitted in the ICU were already colonized or infected with MDR pathogens, and this led to frequent colistin use as part of empirical or microbiologically documented therapy. Colistin resistance was defined as MIC {\textgreater}4 mg/L by the Etest method. All CRKB isolated in surveillance cultures or clinical specimens in the ICU during the period 2004-5 were recorded along with patients' characteristics. RESULTS: Eighteen CRKB were isolated from 13 patients over a 16 month period, representing either colonizing or infective isolates. Patients' mean age was 70 years, with a mean APACHE II score at admission of 22. They all had a long hospitalization (median 69 days) and a long administration of colistin (median 27 days). Colistin-resistant isolates were implicated as pathogens in two bacteraemias, a ventilator-associated pneumonia and two soft tissue infections. Repetitive extragenic palindromic PCR identified six distinct clones, and horizontal transmission was also documented. CONCLUSIONS: Selective pressure due to extensive or inadequate colistin use may lead to the emergence of colistin resistance among K. pneumoniae isolates, jeopardizing treatment options in the ICU, potentially increasing morbidity and mortality of critically ill patients and necessitating prudent use of colistin.",A Antoniadou and F Kontopidou and G Poulakou and E Koratzanis and I Galani and E Papadomichelakis and P Kopterides and M Souli and A Armaganidis and H Giamarellou,"0305-7453

We describe a case of C. striatum bacteremia in a patient with a left ventricular assist device (LVAD); the initial isolate recovered was daptomycin susceptible with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.125 mug/ml. Two months later, and after daptomycin therapy, the individual became bacteremic with an isolate of C. striatum with a daptomycin MIC of {\textgreater}256 mug/ml. To study the prevalence of daptomycin resistance in C. striatum, clinical isolates of C. striatum were grown in broth culture containing daptomycin to investigate the emergence of resistance to this antimicrobial. Molecular typing was used to evaluate serial isolates from the index patient and the clinical isolates of C. striatum we assayed. In vitro analysis of isolates from the index patient and 7 of 11 additional C. striatum isolates exhibited the emergence of high-level daptomycin resistance, despite initially demonstrating low MICs to this antimicrobial agent. This phenotype was persistent even after serial subculture in the absence of daptomycin. Together, these data demonstrate that caution should be taken when using daptomycin to treat high-inoculum infections and/or infections of indwelling medical devices with C. striatum.

12587,MAYBE,Lozano2011c,Article,"Objective: To study the clonal lineages, resistance mechanisms and virulence traits of tetracycline resistant (TetR) MRSA strains isolated in a Spanish Hospital during 2009. Methods: 34 TetR MRSA were detected from unrelated patients in Miguel Servet Hospital during 2009, representing 9.5{\%} of MRSA recovered in that period, and 27 of them were included in this study. The antibiotic susceptibility profile to 23 antibiotics was determined by Microscan{\textregistered} system. Presence of ermA, ermB, ermC, ermT, ermF, msrA/msrB, mphC, cfr, lsa(B), tetK, tetL, tetM, tetO, aac(6)aph(2), mupA, dfrA, dfrD, drfG, and dfrK genes was studied by PCR. Sequences of grlA and gyrA genes were analysed in some of the strains. Determination of SCCmec- and agr-typing was implemented on all MRSA isolates. Spa-typing was performed by PCR and sequencing. Presence of virulence factor genes lukF/lukS, tst, eta, etb, etd and cna was investigated by PCR. Results: The spa-types identified among the 27 TetR MRSA isolates were (no strains): t011 (12), t1197 (1), t3934 (2), t002 (1), t008 (1), t067 (3), t127 (2), t1381 (1), t2220 (2), and 2 new spa-types (t7613, t7577). Fifteen strains (55.6{\%}) were included in spa types related to the livestock-associated sequence type ST398 (t011, t1197 and t3934). These strains and one strain with a new spa-type (t7577) were typed as SCCmecV and agrI. The other strain with a new spa-type (t7613) presented a non-typable SCCmec and agrI. The remaining 10 MRSA strains were typed as SCCmecIV and agrI, agrII or agrIII. The following genes were detected (no strains): ermB (7), ermC (13), ermT (2), msrA/msrB (4), mphC (5), tetK (16), tetM (27), aac(6)aph(2) (5), dfrA (2) and mupA (3). Mutation in quinolone targets were studied in 10 ciprofloxacin resistant ST398 strains and all of them showed S80F amino acid change in GrlA, six also presented S84L, two S84A, one E84G and one no mutation in GyrA. Two strains were PVL positive (t7613 and t008) and 20 strains were cna positive. None of them presented tst, eta, etb and etd genes. Conclusion: More than half of TetR MRSA studied corresponded to spa types associated to the genetic lineage ST398. Tetracycline resistance could be a good initial marker to think about potential ST398, although this resistance can also be detected in other lineages. In addition, PVL positive MRSA were also detected in this collection.",C Lozano and A Rezusta and E Gómez-Sanz and C Colmenarejo and R Báez and D Benito and M Revillo and M Zarazaga and C Torres,1198-743X,Clinical Microbiology and Infection,"amino acid,antibiotic agent,antibiotic resistance,antibiotic sensitivity,ciprofloxacin,gene,hospital,human,livestock,marker,methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus,mutation,patient,quinolone,tetracycline,virulence,virulence factor",S204--S205,{Clonal lineages of tetracycline-resistant MRSA strains isolated in a Spanish hospital during 2009.

19685,MAYBE,Sonnevend2006,Article,"The antibiotic sensitivity and the serotype and molecular type (MT) distribution of 41 Campylobacter jejuni strains isolated from individual patients in Tawam Hospital, Al Ain, United Arab Emirates, were investigated. While all strains were sensitive to erythromycin (MIC 0.5-4 mg l(-1)), 35 isolates (85.4 {\%}) exhibited resistance to ciprofloxacin (MIC 8-64 mg l(-1)). All resistant strains carried the Thr-86 to Ile mutation in the gyrase A (gyrA) gene, as shown by mismatch amplification mutation assay (MAMA) and confirmed by sequencing. Based on the partial sequences of gyrA, resistant isolates carried 10 distinct alleles, eight of them representing new variants. Strains were assigned to 30 MTs based on the combined results of PFGE and flaA PCR-RFLP typing. Eight of the 35 ciprofloxacin-resistant strains, isolated over a period of more than 1 year, represented the largest MT, also carrying the same allelic variant of the gyrA gene. These results show that the local incidence of fluoroquinolone resistance among C. jejuni is one of the highest reported worldwide. It was also demonstrated that stable MTs could persist for a relatively long time among the clonally unrelated antibiotic-resistant isolates of C. jejuni. The data also emphasize the need to replace fluoroquinolones as empirical therapy for diarrhoea of undiagnosed aetiology.",A Sonnevend and V O Rotimi and J Kolodziejek and A Usmani and N Nowotny and T Pal,"0022-2615 (Print)

2989,YES,Camins2007,Article,"BACKGROUND: Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus organisms (VRE) have emerged as common nosocomial pathogens, but few population-based data are available on the impact of invasive VRE infections. METHODS: We assessed the incidence of invasive VRE infections and predictors of mortality among patients identified during prospective, population-based surveillance performed in the metropolitan statistical area (MSA) of Atlanta, Georgia. RESULTS: From July 1997 through June 2000, a total of 192 patients who resided in the Atlanta MSA developed an invasive VRE infection, for a rate of 1.57 cases per 100,000 person-years. The incidence of invasive VRE disease significantly increased from 0.91 cases per 100,000 person-years during the first year of the study to 1.73 cases per 100,000 person-years during the third year of the study (P{\textless}.001). Rates of invasive VRE infection were significantly higher among African American patients than white patients (2.59 vs 0.70 cases per 100,000 person-years; P{\textless}.001). Blood was the most common sterile site from which VRE was recovered (161 [83{\%}] of 193 isolates), followed by deep surgical sites (17 [9{\%}]), peritoneal fluid (10 [5{\%}]), pleural fluid (3 [2{\%}]), and cerebrospinal fluid (1 [0.5{\%}]). In multivariate analysis, a Charlson comorbidity index of 5 or greater, previous receipt of antibiotic therapy, having 2 or more sets of blood cultures positive for VRE, and receipt of central parenteral nutrition were independent predictors of mortality, whereas receipt of an antibiotic with in vitro activity against the VRE isolate was associated with a decreased risk of mortality. Molecular typing revealed 38 different pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns, but the 2 most common pulsed-field gel electrophoresis types were found at 3 Emory University-affiliated hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of invasive VRE infection significantly increased in the Atlanta MSA during the 3-year study period, with significant racial disparities detected. Receipt of an antimicrobial agent with in vitro activity against VRE was associated with a lower mortality rate. Molecular typing results demonstrated polyclonal emergence of VRE in Atlanta.",B C Camins and M M Farley and J J Jernigan and S M Ray and J P Steinberg and H M Blumberg,"0899-823X (Print)

Techniques such as spoligotyping and Mycobacterium interspersed repetitive units-variable-number tandem-repeat typing of mycobacterial isolates have been employed to confirm familial outbreaks of MDR-TB. We diagnosed and traced four MDR-TB cases in a family via genotyping. Despite aggressive treatment, the index case remained culture positive, but the other patients were cured. This is the first documentation of a familial MDR-TB outbreak affecting human immunodeficiency virus-seronegative patients in eastern Taiwan. Molecular techniques are important in the identification of sources of MDR-TB infections. The adult index case in our study developed MDR-TB due to poor compliance with the drug regimen (acquired resistance), followed by transmission of MDR-TB to his children in close household contact.

15012,MAYBE,Ngamskulrungroj2015,Article,"Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a leading cause of healthcare-associated morbidity and mortality worldwide. In Thailand, CDI exhibits low recurrence and mortality and its molecular epidemiology is unknown. CDI surveillance was conducted in a tertiary facility (Siriraj Hospital, Bangkok). A total of 53 toxigenic C. difficile strains from Thai patients were analyzed by multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), PCR ribotyping, and pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The mean age of the cohort was 64 years and 62.3{\%} were female; 37.7{\%} of patients were exposed to {\textgreater} two antibiotics prior to a diagnosis of CDI, with beta-lactams the most commonly used drug (56.3{\%}). Metronidazole was used most commonly (77.5{\%}; success rate 83.9{\%}), and non-responders were treated with vancomycin (success rate 100{\%}). None of the isolates carried binary toxin genes. Most isolates (98.2-100{\%}) were susceptible to metronidazole, vancomycin, tigecycline and daptomycin. There were 11 sequence types (STs), 13 ribotypes (RTs) and four PFGE types. Six previously identified STs (ST12, ST13, ST14, ST33, ST41 and ST45) and five novel STs unique to Thailand (ST66, ST67, ST68, ST69 and ST70) were identified. PCR RTs UK 017 (ST45) (45.3{\%}) and UK 014/020 (ST33) (24.5{\%}) were the most common. High concordance was observed between the MLST and ribotyping results (p{\textless}0.001). C. difficile isolates from Thai patients were highly susceptible to standard antimicrobial agents. In conclusion, the five STs indicate the high genetic diversity and unique polymorphisms in Thailand.

9573,MAYBE,Jankovic2011,Article,"We present a case of systemic Mycobacterium chelonae infection in an immunosuppressed patient with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), idiopathic hypoparathyroidism, and hypothyroidism. The patient was treated for 3 months for skin infection with clarithromycin monotherapy. Since her condition deteriorated, the antibiotic therapy was switched to intravenously administered clindamycin, cloxacillin, and meropenem. Due to further deterioration and isolation of M. chelonae from the blood culture, antimicrobial therapy was changed to azithromycin and amikacin. Drug-test sensitivity was performed, and the isolate was susceptible to clarithromycin only. The patient's deteriorating status prevented orally administered medication with clarithromycin (parenteral formulation is not registered in Croatia). The same antibiotic regime was continued until the isolation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. In addition, extensive calcifications in her brain were found on a computed tomography (CT) scan, which suggested Fahr's syndrome. Despite all measures and supportive care, the patient developed multiorgan failure and eventually died. There has been an increase in the number of infections by rapidly growing mycobacteria, but only a few cases of severe systemic infection with M. chelonae have been described. If the infection is diagnosed early and a patient is treated with appropriate drugs, dissemination can be avoided despite immunosuppression. For serious skin, bone, and soft-tissue disease, a minimum of 4 months of a combined drug therapy is necessary.

The patient was treated with ampicillin for 6 weeks and gentamicin for the first 2 weeks with complete recovery. {\textcopyright} 2008 Lippincott Williams {\&} Wilkins, Inc.",A Dalal and C Urban and D Rubin and M Ahluwalia,1056-9103,Infectious Diseases in Clinical Practice,"Enterococcus raffinosus,aged,ampicillin,antibiotic therapy,bacterial endocarditis,bacterium culture,bacterium isolation,blood culture,case report,daptomycin,drug withdrawal,enterococcal infection,female,gentamicin,human,linezolid,moxifloxacin,penicillin G,review,treatment duration,treatment outcome,vancomycin,vancomycin resistant Enterococcus",144--146,{Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus raffinosus endocarditis: A case report and review of literature},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L351775669 http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/IPC.0b013e31816379fc http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=10569103{\&}id=doi:10.1097{\%}2FIPC.0b013e31816379fc{\&}atitle=Vancomyc,16,2008,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,MAYBE,Cale,MAYBE,Brooke,Brooke,Zach_1,
3195,YES,Carvalho2006,Article,"Metallo-beta-lactamase production is emerging worldwide as an important mechanism of carbapenem resistance among nonfermentative Gram-negative isolates, and this mechanism is becoming frequently observed in Brazil. This study documents the occurrence and characteristics of an epidemic SPM-1-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain in a teaching hospital located in Rio de Janeiro City, Brazil. The bla (SPM-1) gene and a class 1 integron were detected in 13 isolates, representing 20{\%} of the 65 imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates obtained from January, 2000, to August, 2001. DNA sequencing revealed that this integron carries three gene cassettes that confer resistance to antimicrobials, aacA4, bla (OXA-56), and aadA7, and an orf1 encoding a putative transposase. All 13 SPM-producing P. aeruginosa isolates had closely related pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) profiles, designated as clonal group A, suggesting nosocomial spread of the strain. This clonal group was the same as that observed in other SPM-1-producing P. aeruginosa isolates from distinct Brazilian states. The dissemination of this clone throughout Brazil could not be explained by transfer of infected patients and/or sharing of common health-care staff. It is likely that the spread of these strains occurred indirectly via the community.",A P Carvalho and R M Albano and D N {de Oliveira} and D A Cidade and L M Teixeira and A {Marques Ede},"1076-6294 (Print)

METHODS: Between January 2000 and June 2008, inpatient and outpatient S aureus isolates were reviewed for antibiotic susceptibility. In particular, cultures from 153 abscesses in the head and neck region were assessed for clindamycin and methicillin resistance patterns. RESULTS: Annual clindamycin resistance rates for all S aureus isolates, and specifically for S aureus head and neck abscesses, revealed concerning levels of clindamycin and methicillin resistance. After 2002, the mean clindamycin resistance rate in head and neck abscesses was approximately 27{\%}. The number of new cases of methicillinresistant S aureus per year increased from four cases in 2000 to 44 cases in 2007. CONCLUSION: Antibiotic resistance should be considered following failed empirical therapy of head and neck abscesses with clindamycin. {\textcopyright}2011 Pulsus Group Inc.

9937,MAYBE,Kaase2011,Article,"Objectives: To analyse the mechanisms responsible for carbapenem resistance in one Acinetobacter baumannii isolate recovered from a patient transferred to Germany from an Egyptian hospital. Methods: PCR and sequencing were used to search for $\beta$-lactamase and 16S RNA methylase genes. Multilocus sequence typing was used to determine the sequence type (ST) of the isolate. Results: Sequencing of the PCR product obtained using primers for blaNDM-1 revealed a variant of NDM-1 that had a C to G substitution at position 82 resulting in an amino acid substitution of proline to alanine at position 28. This variant was designated NDM-2. Genes encoding extended-spectrum $\beta$-lactamases or 16S RNA methylase were not detected. The strain lacked detectable plasmids and blaNDM-2 was not transferred by conjugation. MLST showed that the isolate belonged to a new ST, ST103. Conclusions: This work further underlines the spread of NDM carbapenemases in A. baumannii, and the spread of the corresponding gene in the Middle East. It also describes the first variant of NDM-1. {\textcopyright} The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy.
