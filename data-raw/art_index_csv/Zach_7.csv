274,YES,Ahmed2016a,Article,"Background: It is important and rather need of the hour to unravel the risk of antimicrobial resistance from a public health perspective in high burden countries such as India. The clinical significance of isolating multi-drug resistant (MDR) E. coli from hospitalized patients merits sustained attention. The objective of this study was to describe the evolution of antibiotic resistance and to gather evidence on spread of antimicrobial resistance by clonal expansion of clinical E. coli lineages. Methods {\&} Materials: A collection of 426 E. coli isolates was analysed as three subsequent batches from two tertiary care hospitals in India. The isolates were characterized by ERIC-based fingerprinting, O typing, phylogenetic grouping, MLST, virulence profiling, phenotypic and genotypic antimicrobial resistance analysis and whole genome sequence (WGS) analysis. Our integrated data were representative of a larger study aimed at understanding transmission dynamics, population genetic structure and shaping of antimicrobial resistance mechanisms in extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC). Results: We found that the resistance to unrelated antimicrobials is rapidly emerging in the form of ESBL-MDR phenotypes (58{\%}). The molecular epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance has undergone a rapid change over the course of our study with increase in ESBL, MDR and MBL rates from 31{\%}, 50{\%} and 0{\%} to 86{\%}, 95{\%} and 28{\%} respectively, as observed among the isolates studied in 2009 and 2012. Also the faecal E. coli isolates (37{\%}) exhibited the acquisition of new ESBL variants such as CTX-M-15 instead of the classical TEM and SHV types. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that groups B2 and A were prevalent among clinical E. coli isolates (49{\%} and 27{\%} respectively). REP-PCR, MLST and PFGE analyses suggest that ExPEC strains are undergoing a sub-clonal evolution as demonstrated by the identification of ST131 E. coli in our collection (42{\%}). E. coli ST131 was initially identified to be linked to the spread of fluoroquinolone resistance and CTX-M-15 extended-spectrum $\beta$- lactamase (ESBL) production. Alarmingly, ST131 strains harbouring NDM-1 (1.5{\%}) carbapenem resistance were also identified. Conclusion: This study suggests that clinical E. coli from India are strongly associated with CTX-M-15 enzyme and are clonally evolving with a potential for newer acquisitions and wide spread dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genes.",N Ahmed,1201-9712,International Journal of Infectious Diseases,"Escherichia coli,India,antibiotic resistance,antiinfective agent,carbapenem,clonal evolution,enzyme,extended spectrum beta lactamase,extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli,gene,genome,hospital patient,human,infection,molecular epidemiology,penicillinase,phenotype,phylogeny,population dynamics,population genetic structure,public health,risk,sequence analysis,tertiary care center,virulence",210,"{Tracking the emergence of multidrug resistant, extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli in India}",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L72245432 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2016.02.479 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=12019712{\&}id=doi:10.1016{\%}2Fj.ijid.2016.02.479{\&}atitle=Tracking+the+,45,2016,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,YES,Allison,YES,Nchedo,Nchedo,Zach,yes,,

743,MAYBE,Amsaveni2010,Article,"Drug resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa is rapidly increasing in hospitalized patients. A prospective study on various clinical isolates, from patients admitted from various parts of Coimbatore was conducted to ascertain the prevalence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. Prevalence of drug resistant isolates was estimated by screening with anti-pseudomonal antibiotics, genderwise and hospital wardwise. Among 750 samples processed 95 were confirmed for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The highest rate of infection due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa was observed in ICU's and general internal ward. Genderwise prevalence showed 62{\%} males and 37{\%} females were infected by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The highest percentage of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were observed in pus (40{\%}) and urine (32{\%}) samples. The results showed that antimicrobial resistance among Pseudomonas aeruginosa has increased for most anti-pseudomonal agents, such as amoxyclave(96.84{\%}), ceftriaxone(95{\%}), ceftazidime (71{\%}) and ticarrillin (76{\%}). Amikacin, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, meropenem, tobramycin, piperacillin and gentamycin are the drugs of choice for treatment, but in the near future the antimicrobial agents may lose their efficacy because of the spread of resistant organism due to indiscriminate use of antibiotics, lack of awareness, patient noncompliance and unhygienic conditions. Etiologic shifts in nosocomial infections and an upsurge of antimicrobial resistance among these pathogens are impressive and alarming.

Methods: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by Etest and microdilution according to CLSI guidelines. Resistance genes and their genetic environment were characterized by Check-points CT102 array and by PCR-sequencing. Plasmids were extracted by Kieser method, typed by PCR-based replicon typing and transferred by mating-out assays and transformation. VIM-31 was cloned in pET-28a and purified by ion-exchange chromatography and gel filtration. Kinetic parameters of VIM-31 were determined against various beta-lactams and a 3D homology model was constructed using EsyPred3D server. Results: A CNSE isolate (Eclo11236) was recovered from several blood cultures of an 87-year old female who underwent colectomy for intestinal adenocarcinoma and who subsequently developed a rectovaginal fistula and secondary peritonitis. Eclo11236 was intermediately susceptible to imipenem (IMI) (MIC = 3 $\mu$g/mL) and resistant to ertapenem (MIC = 6 $\mu$g/mL) while remaining susceptible to meropenem (MIC = 0.5 $\mu$g/mL), aztreonam, tigecycline, amikacin and ciprofloxacin. The presence of an MBL in this isolate was evidenced by a positive double disc synergy test with imipenem (IMI) and EDTA; the patient gradually improved following treatment with ciprofloxacin, but she remained persistently colonized with the same Eclo11236 in urine. PCR-sequencing revealed a new blaVIM-31 allele coding two Tyr224His and His252Arg mutations in comparison to VIM-2 and located upstream to aacA4' gene in a class 1 integron (In669) carried on a 42-kb not-typeable but transferable plasmid. VIM-31 presents a broad-spectrum activity, affecting all beta-lactam compounds except aztreonam. Comparatively to VIM-2, VIM-31 exhibits a lower catalytic activity (lower kcat and higher Km values) against beta-lactams with kcat/Km ratios ranging from 4.5 (ceftazidime), 900 (ampicillin), 1900 (cefotaxime) to 2400/mM/s (imipenem). Conclusion: We described here a new VIM-31 variant with 2 point mutations leading to modifications of its catalytic properties in comparison to VIM-2.

Four hundred and ten CA-MRSA isolates were prospectively collected and screened for the presence of Panton-Valentin leucocidin (PVL) and toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST-1) encoding genes, while clinical information were recorded. PVL- and TSST-1-positive isolates were genotyped by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) type, spa type and multilocus sequence type (MLST) were determined on representative isolates. One hundred and fifty-nine (39 {\%}) isolates were PVL-positive. PVL-positive isolates were significantly more frequently isolated from skin or soft tissue than PVL-negative isolates, causing mainly subcutaneous abscesses and furuncles. Patients with PVL-positive CA-MRSA were significantly younger than patients with PVL-negative CA-MRSA. Eighty-seven percent of the PVL-positive isolates belonged to a limited number (n = 7) of PFGE types belonging to sequence types (ST) ST80, ST8, ST30, ST5, ST152, ST338 and a new ST, a single-locus variant of ST1.

Materials and methods Microorganisms isolated from blood were identified and tested for susceptibility to antimicrobial using Vitek 2 systems and CLSI guidelines. Results From 1 Jan 2009 to 31 Dec 2010, 65 strains of E.coli were isolated from blood cultures taken during episodes of sepsis. E.coli represented 16.6{\%} of all microorganisms isolated and 57.4{\%} of Gram negative isolates. All isolates displayed susceptibility to carbapenems and tigecycline; resistance to other antibiotics was 73.8{\%} for ampicillin, 20{\%} for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, 16.9{\%} for gentamicin, 27.6{\%} for ceftazidime, 10.7{\%} for piperacillin/tazobactam, 44.6{\%} for co-trimoxazole, 52.3{\%} for ciprofloxacin, 64.1{\%} for levofloxacin; 31.8{\%} of isolates were ESBL producers.

5225,MAYBE,Diene2013,Article,"Clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa exhibiting high-level resistance to carbapenems were recovered from a French patient with cystic fibrosis (CF) who had not received carbapenem therapy. This study was conducted to investigate the molecular mechanism conferring the carbapenem-resistant phenotype in clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa recovered from the same CF patient chronically colonised since 2005. Investigation of imipenem resistance of P. aeruginosa strain{\_}02 isolated in May 2011 showed no carbapenemase activity. However, amplification and sequencing of the oprD porin gene revealed disruption of this gene by an insertion sequence (IS) element of 1337 bp that contained a novel transposase of 1227 bp (ISPa46) bordered by two terminal imperfect inverted repeats of 28 bp, which was associated with carbapenem resistance. Retrospective analysis of five additional strains of P. aeruginosa isolated before May 2011 from the same patient revealed that all isolates were likely to be the same clone by multilocus sequence typing analysis (ST540/551), but one of the five isolates was imipenem-susceptible. Although it was possible to demonstrate the presence of ISPa46 in all strains by PCR, this IS was transposed in the oprD gene only for imipenem-resistant isolates. Therefore, this study reports a novel IS element (ISPa46) in P. aeruginosa clinical isolates of a CF patient in Marseille, France, that was associated with carbapenem resistance and was selected in the absence of carbapenem treatment.",S M Diene and T L'Homme and S Bellulo and N Stremler and J C Dubus and L Mely and S Leroy and N Degand and J M Rolain,"0924-8579

7587,MAYBE,Gotting2015,Article,"Introduction: Although the prevalence of carbapenemase-producing Acinetobacter baumannii (CP-AB) in Germany is still low an increasing number of outbreaks has been reported in recent years. In August 2014 we observed a cluster of 4 patients with CP-AB (OXA-23) on our surgical intensive care unit (SICU). Objectives: After excluding an environmental source we performed epidemiological analyses to gain insight into the spread of CP-AB in our university hospital. Methods: To characterize the CP-AB isolates molecular typing using amplified fragment length polymorphism was conducted. A genotypic comparison with strains collected in 2013 and the first half of 2014 was carried out. All new patient isolates of CP-AB were genotyped prospectively. Results: Molecular typing revealed that 3 out of the 4 SICU-isolates were genotypically identical. Although temporally and locally coinciding, the 4th isolate of the patient cluster did not match.This 4th strain however was identical to a strain previously identified in a patient from the neurological department in July 2014. A physical link between these two patients could not be identified. Even more surprisingly, another isolate of CB-AB from a neurosurgical patient isolated in September 2014 was found to be identical with the three isolates of the SICU cluster, despite the absence of detectable temporal or local link to the SICU. Conclusion: Isolates of CP-AB from six patients fell into two clusters of two and four strains, respectively. In this case patient transfer within the hospital cannot explain these unexpected genotypical relationships between isolates from three departments. Transmission of CP-AB may have occurred in the context of consultants' visits or when patients were temporarily moved to a diagnostic unit such as endoscopy or radiology. In the context of clusters of CP-AB isolated from several patients, genotyping provides the opportunity to follow the movement of these highly resistant bacteria within a hospital. Surprising genotyping results should engender efforts to analyse the pathways of transmission.",T G√∂tting and W Ebner and D Jonas and A Serr and G H√§cker and M Dettenkofer,2047-2994,Antimicrobial Resistance and Infection Control,"Acinetobacter baumannii,Germany,amplified fragment length polymorphism,bacterium,carbapenemase,consultation,diagnosis,endoscopy,genotype,hospital,human,infection control,intensive care unit,molecular typing,neurosurgery,patient,patient transport,prevalence,prevention,radiology,university hospital",NA,{Carbapenemase-producing Acinetobacter baumannii in a surgical intensive care unit-take time for tracking},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L72039077 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=20472994{\&}id=doi:{\&}atitle=Carbapenemase-producing+Acinetobacter+baumannii+in+a+surgical+intensive+care+unit-take,4,2015,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,MAYBE,Cale,NO,Brooke,Allison,Zach,yes,,

METHODS: Between January 2000 and July 2001, a case-finding study was performed in 13 Zambian prisons for pulmonary TB. Prisoners were administered a questionnaire to obtain demographic information. Information regarding housing density and diet was also collected. Three consecutive first morning sputum specimens were cultured for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Antimicrobial resistance testing was performed by the resistance ratio method. RESULTS: A total of 1080 prisoners were recruited: 1055 were males and 25 females. Sputum from 245 (22.7{\%}) prisoners yielded M. tuberculosis, including 168 (15.6{\%}) with smear-positive disease. Based on a total prison population of 6118, the minimal prevalence of TB was 4.0{\%}. There was a linear relationship between the proportion of prisoners evaluated and the prevalence of TB (R(2) = 0.9366) across facilities, suggesting that the true prevalence of TB may approach 15-20{\%}. Resistance to at least one anti-tuberculosis drug was detected for 40 (23.8{\%}) isolates, while MDR-TB was identified for 16 (9.5{\%}) isolates.

METHODS: Two E. cloacae isolates recovered from different regions in Germany and showing reduced susceptibility to carbapenems were analysed. Susceptibility testing, conjugation, transformation assays, plasmid analysis, sequencing and molecular typing using rep-PCR were performed. RESULTS: The two clinical isolates carried the bla(GIM-1) gene and showed resistance to ertapenem, with variable MIC values of imipenem and meropenem. The isolates were clonally unrelated. The bla(GIM-1) gene was located on self-transferable and non-typeable plasmids. Both isolates harboured distinct plasmids and integron structures containing the bla(GIM-1) gene cassette. Interestingly, one of the two plasmids was able to replicate in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, demonstrating its broad host range. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first identification in E. cloacae of the bla(GIM-1) gene, which is responsible for reduced susceptibility to carbapenems. We showed that this gene, previously identified in P. aeruginosa, was located in a different genetic background in E. cloacae.

Herein, we describe molecular characteristics of MRSA isolated from abdominal cellulitis in a 7-year-old Japanese boy. This MRSA was PVL-positive and belonged to the Taiwanese multiple drug-resistant CA-MRSA clone with the genotype of ST59, staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) VII (SCCmecV, according to recent reclassification), agr1a (a novel agr1 subtype), and SaPI (which carried seb1, a newly designated variant seb gene). This study demonstrates the first isolation of the Taiwanese PVL-positive ST59 MRSA clone in Japan. The data also demonstrate novel subtypes in agr1 and seb and suggest that a combination of agr1a, seb1, and PVL could contribute to cellulitis (and its recurrence).

Methods: Four K. pneumoniae isolates, (A2, B1, B2, B6), recovered in March and April 2011 from two intensive care unit (ICU) patients in a General hospital located in a seaside resort of Uruguay, were analysed. Bacterial identification and susceptibility testing were performed using Vitek 2 GN and AST-N082-card and E-test (bioM{\'{e}}rieux{\textregistered}). Phenotypic confirmation for KPCs and Metallo-b-Lactamases were performed with the KPC plus MBL confirm ID Kit (ROSCO{\textregistered}). CDC protocol for rectal cultures.The presence of blaKPC, blaIMP and blaVIM, was determined by PCR and further sequencing. Isoelectrofocusing was performed using the PhastSystem and commercial PhastaGels IEF 3-9. The genetic relatedness was evaluated by PFGE using XbaI and MLST. Population analysis and investigation of the stability of meropenem (MEM) heteroresistance were done on isolates B1 and B6, recovered from pre and post antibiotic treatment, respectively. A set of infection control measures and root cause analysis were done. Results and discussion: All isolates showed a multiresistant phenotype including to colistin but susceptibility to tigecycline. B6 exhibited MEM MICs higher ({\textgreater}32 $\mu$g/mL) than the initial isolate B1 (8 $\mu$g/mL) and also higher MICs to other antibiotic classes. All isolates produced a KPC-2 enzyme with an isoelectric point of 6.7. Their macro-restriction pattern were indistinguishable and A2 isolate belonged to the internationally spread ST258 KPC-Kp clone (Table 1). B1 and B6 isolates represented a heterogeneous and homogeneous MEM resistant population, respectively. Health authorities were notified. Control measures were extended contact isolation; screening of contacts and pre-emptive isolation; close the ICU to new patients; reinforce environmental hygiene. No new cases were detected up to September 2011. (Table Presented) Conclusions: The first KPC-Kp outbreak was detected in Uruguay. A novel K. pneumoniae resistance behaviour was observed after antibiotic therapy, suggesting the selection of not only a MEM resistant homogeneous subpopulation with higher b-lactams MICs but also exhibiting resistance to other antibiotic classes.

9630,YES,Jeannot2011,Article,"Objectives: Pseudomonas aeruginosa may become highly resistant to carbapenems and almost all b-lactam antibiotics by horizontal transfer of metallo-b-lactamase genes (MBLs). To date, 6 types of MBLs (IMP, VIM, SPM, GIM, AIM et DIM) have been reported in this organism. This study describes a novel IMP-type enzyme produced by two P. aeruginosa clinical strains collected at the teaching hospital of Besanc¬∏on (France). Methods: Strains 10266 and 10298 were isolated from a rectal screening sample and a blood culture of two patients admitted in 2010, respectively. Drug susceptibility testing, strain genotyping by PFGE, MBL production, PCR amplification, cloning and sequencing experiments were performed according to standard protocols. Results: Double disc synergy tests using imipenem and EDTA indicated MBL production in these two genotypically related strains only susceptible to aztreonam and colistin. A gene encoding an enzyme distantly related to IMP-8 (identity {\textless}70{\%}) and referred to as IMP-29 was amplified by PCR and sequenced. In strain 10298, blaIMP-29 was located in a typical class 1 integron downstream of gene cassettes aacA4 et dfrII. The genetic environment of blaIMP-29 appeared to be very different in 10266 as the gene lied alone with the P2 promoter of intL1 on a transferable plasmid of 20 kb. Interestingly, the PU21 tranconjugants were susceptible to piperacillin (MIC = 8 mg/mL), of intermediate susceptibility to imipenem (8 mg/mL) and higly resistant to meropenem (‚â•128 mg/mL), doripenem (64 mg/mL), ceftazidime (‚â•128 mg/mL) and ticarcillin (‚â•128 mg/mL). A second class 1 integron harboring gene blaPSE-1 flanked by gene cassettes aacA4 and aadA2 was detected in the two strains. Finally, the presence of a stop codon in gene oprD accounted for the high level resistance to imipenem in both isolates. Conclusion: This new transferable MBL identified in France provides P. aeruginosa with an atypical MBL resistance phenotype which can be misidentified when additional resistance mechanisms are present (penicillinase PSE-1, loss of porin OprD).

METHODS: The descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted from May 2009 to June 2012 at the Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, and comprised non-duplicate clinical carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae isolates obtained from different collection units across Pakistan. Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion screening of carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae was confirmed by minimum inhibitory concentration using E-test. Polymerase chain reaction assay was performed to detect blaKPC, blaNDM-1, blaIMP, and blaVIM genes. In addition variable number tandem repeat typing was performed on selected cluster of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1-positive Klebsiella pneumoniae. RESULTS: Of the 114 carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae isolates, 104(94{\%}) tested positive for blaNDM-1 gene. At 68(66{\%}), Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most frequent species isolated, followed by E.coli 33(31{\%}). Moreover, 89(78{\%}) of the blaNDM-1 gene positive Klebsiella pneumonia isolates were from the clinical samples of patients admitted to the critical care units and 75(66{\%}) were from neonates and the elderly. Of the 65(67{\%}) patients suffering from bacteraemia and sepsis, 32(57{\%}) had expired, of which 22(60{\%}) were aged {\textless}1 month. Variable number tandem repeat analysis of hospital-acquired New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1-positive Klebsiella pneumoniae showed similarities between the isolates.

Hungarian microbiological laboratories were asked to send all KP strains showing cefoxitin resistance and decreased susceptibility or resistance to any third-generation cephalosporins to the Reference Laboratories at the National Center for Epidemiology. Investigation was conducted in order to outline spatio-temporal distribution and genetic characterization of pAmpC-KP isolates in Hungary. Between December 2009 and December 2013, 312 consecutive KP clinical isolates were confirmed as producing pAmpCs. All isolates showed resistance to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones, and 77{\%} were non-susceptible to at least one carbapenem. Analysis of $\beta$-lactamase genes showed blaDHA-1 in all and additionally blaCTX-M-15 in 90{\%} of isolates. PFGE typing revealed 12 pulsotypes; of these, KP053 (262/312) and KP070 (38/312) belonged to sequence type ST11 and comprised 96{\%} of the isolates. The blaDHA-1 and blaCTX-M-15 coproducing KP053/ST11 clone affected 234 patients and spread to 55 healthcare centres across Hungary during the study period. Three KP053 isolates were also resistant to colistin. In two of these, the mgrB gene was truncated by IS10R, while in the third isolate, insertional inactivation of mgrB by ISKPn14 was identified. Hungary is the first European country showing endemic spread of blaDHA-1 facilitated by the international high-risk clone ST11.

Here, we report the cluster of linezolid- and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (LVRE) in a German department for hematologic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Methods: In this retrospective analysis we included all patients with LVRE in a university-based department for HSCT in 2014 and 2015. Patients chart reviews were used to investigate the epidemiology and clinical outcome. Available LVRE isolates underwent detailed microbiological characterization and genotyping by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Results: In total, 20 patients with LVRE were identified within the observed time period. All except two patients underwent allogeneic HSCT. Surveillance culture results from incoming patients and chart review revealed that 10 of 20 patients were colonized at hospital admission. Eight of 10 patients with in-hospital acquired LVRE had previous linezolid treatment. Analysis of spatio-temporal patterns showed no evidence for LVRE patient-to-patient or environment-to-patient transmission within the HSCT department. In five cases (25{\%}) LVRE bloodstream infection occurred. Nine LVRE isolates could be saved for characterization. Eight isolates carried vanA, one isolate vanB. PFGE analysis showed that four different LVRE clones were responsible for the cluster. One single genotype was present in six LVRE isolates whereupon the corresponding patients were all referred from the same hospital to the HSCT department. Conclusions: This is the first report demonstrating the emergence of LVRE in a German HSCT department. (L)VRE screening at patients' admission and appropriate infection control strategies were sufficient to prevent any transmission.

A sample of bronchial lavage fluid obtained by bronchofiberscopy showed filamentous branching gram-positive rods and acid-fast filamentous branching rods, and a colony of suspected Nocardia was cultured. Based on 16S rRNA, gyrB, rpoB, secA1 and hsp65 gene sequence analyses and biochemical and physiological properties, the strain was identified as N. mexicana. The strain was resistant to the antimicrobial agents amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, clarithromycin, minocycline, gentamycin, tobramycin, ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

METHODS: Two hundred and thirty-five ertapenem-non-susceptible (MIC {\textgreater}/= 0.5 mg/L) isolates of Enterobacteriaceae from the worldwide Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART) 2009 programme were screened using a multiplex PCR for the presence of bla(KPC), bla(OXA-48), bla(VIM) and bla(NDM-1) genes. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) and AmpC genes (bla(ESBL) and bla(AmpC)) were identified using the Check-MDR CT101 microarray. DNA sequencing was performed to identify the bla(ESBL), bla(KPC) and bla(NDM-1) genes. Molecular typing was also performed to genetically characterize these isolates. RESULTS: Sixty-six isolates (28{\%}) had a carbapenemase gene, with bla(NDM-1) identified in 33 isolates including 2 isolates carrying both bla(NDM-1) and bla(OXA-48); other carbapenemase genes found included bla(KPC) (n = 23), bla(VIM) (n = 7) and bla(OXA-48) (n = 3). All bla(NDM-1)-carrying isolates were from patients in India and comprised five different species. With the exception of one isolate carrying only bla(NDM-1), all bla(NDM-1) carbapenemase-possessing isolates carried additional beta-lactamases in various combinations: bla(ESBL) and bla(AmpC) (n = 18); bla(ESBL) (n = 10); bla(ESBL), bla(AmpC) and bla(OXA-48) (n = 2); and bla(AmpC) (n = 2). Except for bla(OXA-48)-carrying isolates, novel multilocus sequence types or enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus PCR patterns were observed along with clonal dissemination within and among sites. CONCLUSIONS: A range of carbapenemase genes, associated with diverse ESBLs and/or AmpC backgrounds, were found among Enterobacteriaceae isolated during the study. Many of these ertapenem non-susceptible strains were clonally related and carried various combinations of beta-lactamases.",C Lascols and M Hackel and S H Marshall and A M Hujer and S Bouchillon and R Badal and D Hoban and R A Bonomo,0305-7453,J Antimicrob Chemother,"Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology,Cluster Analysis,DNA, Bacterial/genetics,Drug Resistance, Bacterial/genetics,Enterobacteriaceae Infections/*epidemiology/microb,Enterobacteriaceae/enzymology/*genetics,Environmental Monitoring,Epidemiological Monitoring,Genetic Variation,Humans,India/epidemiology,Microarray Analysis,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Multilocus Sequence Typing,beta-Lactamases/*genetics,beta-Lactams/pharmacology",1992--1997,{Increasing prevalence and dissemination of NDM-1 metallo-beta-lactamase in India: data from the SMART study (2009)},NA,66,2011,9,"1460-2091

12754,MAYBE,Ma2015d,Article,"BACKGROUND: The importance of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) in Chinese hospitals is not clearly delineated. Thus we sought to assess the prevalence of MDRO in Chinese intensive care units (ICUs). METHODS: Prospective study of inpatients admitted consecutively to eight ICUs in four Chinese cities in 2009-10. Admission and weekly screenings were performed by using selective media for methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. For the two latters, resistance to ceftazidime defined MDRO. Backward logistic regression models were designed to assess factors independently associated with MDRO carriage on admission and MDRO acquisition within ICUs. RESULTS: 686 patients were included, and the MDRO prevalence rate on admission was 30.5 {\%} (32.7 {\%} for ESBL-positive Enterobacteriaceae, 3.2 {\%} for MRSA). Antibiotic treatment prior to ICU admission was independently associated with carriage on admission (OR: 1.4) in multivariate analysis. A total of 104 patients acquired {\textgreater}/=1 MDRO in ICU (overall attack rate: 23.7 {\%}; 14.9 {\%} for ESBL-positive Enterobacteriaceae, and 5.1 {\%} for MRSA). The MDRO attack rate increased from 13.2 {\%} in the first week to 82.1 {\%} for ICU stay {\textgreater} 3 weeks. Duration of antibiotic exposure (OR: 1.16; 1.1-1.2) and prior antibiotic treatment before ICU (OR: 2.1; 1.1-3.3) were associated with MDRO acquisition in multivariate analysis. The MDRO prevalence rate on ICU discharge was 51.2 {\%} and the global prevalence density rate 71 per 1000 hospital-days. CONCLUSION: More than one out of two patients was MDRO carrier on ICU discharge in Chinese hospitals. This is the result of the combination of a high MDRO prevalence rate on ICU admission and a high MDRO acquisition rate within ICU.",X Ma and Y Wu and L Li and Q Xu and B Hu and Y Ni and A Wu and S Sun and V Jarlier and J Robert,1471-2334,BMC Infectious Diseases,",*Drug Resistance,80 and over,Acinetobacter,Acinetobacter/isolation {\&} purification,Adult,Aged,Bacterial,Child,China/epidemiology,Chinese,Cross Infection/microbiology,Enterobacteriaceae/isolation {\&} purification,Female,Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections/*epidemiology/m,Humans,Intensive Care Units/*statistics {\&} numerical data,Male,Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus/isolat,Middle Aged,Multiple,Prevalence,Prospective Studies,Pseudomonas aeruginosa,Pseudomonas aeruginosa/isolation {\&} purification,Staphylococcal Infections/*epidemiology/microbiolo,Young Adult,aged,aminoglycoside,antibiotic resistance,article,bacterium carrier,bacterium culture,beta-Lactam Resistance,carbapenem,ceftazidime,cephalosporin,child,drug use,extended spectrum beta lactamase producing Enterob,female,glycopeptide,hospital discharge,hospital patient,human,intensive care unit,length of stay,major clinical study,male,methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus,nonhuman,nose smear,penicillin derivative,prevalence,prospective study,quinolone derivative,treatment duration",358,{First multicenter study on multidrug resistant bacteria carriage in Chinese ICUs},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L605648549 http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12879-015-1105-7 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=14712334{\&}id=doi:10.1186{\%}2Fs12879-015-1105-7{\&}atitle=First+multicen,15,2015,1,"From Duplicate 1 (First multicenter study on multidrug resistant bacteria carriage in Chinese ICUs - Ma, X; Wu, Y; Li, L; Xu, Q; Hu, B; Ni, Y; Wu, A; Sun, S; Jarlier, V; Robert, J)

12905,MAYBE,Majewski2014a,Article,"BACKGROUND: The utility of carbapenems, which are considered 'last-line' agents, is being diminished by the growing incidence of various resistance mechanisms in bacteria. We aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism of carbapenem resistance in Enterobacter cloacae recovered from a 76-year-old patient who had undergone coronary artery bypass grafting and repair of the mitral and tricuspid valves. Interestingly, the patient had no prior history of hospital admission abroad. METHODS: The Carba-NP test II and synergy testing were performed to confirm carbapenemase activity. PCR was used to detect carbapenemase-encoding genes. Nucleotide and amino acid sequence analysis was performed to identify OXA-48 variants. Moreover, we performed multilocus sequence typing (MLST) of multidrug-resistant (MDR) E. cloacae. RESULTS: We detected no significant increase in zone diameter around disks with inhibitors. However, the Carba-NP test II revealed carbapenemase activity in all isolates. All isolates showed the presence of the exact OXA-48 carbapenemase variant. Furthermore, MLST analysis revealed that the MDR E. cloacae isolates belonged to ST89. CONCLUSIONS: We report a case of infection caused by a unique carbapenem-resistant E. cloacae ST89 producing OXA-48 carbapenemase. Interestingly, these pathogens developed resistance to other 'last-resort' agents, namely colistin and tigecycline.

12931,MAYBE,Malande2015,Article,"Introduction Carbapenem Resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) infections are increasingly reported among adult patients, with very little described in paediatric population, with currently no reports describing this problem in the African Paediatric setting. Method This is a retrospective observational study that aimed at describing the emergence of CRE at Red Cross Children Hospital (RCWMCH), between 2012 and 2015. We identified CRE confirmed from cultured samples of patients at RCWMCH for the period 2012-March 2015. We analysed pharmacy records and case records from the hospital folders of identified patients together with antibiotic sensitivity and specific molecular typing and modified Hodge test results. Results The first CRE episode was an isolated case in November 2012. In May/June 2013, the Hospital prompted by a new CRE infection case, instituted screening exercise where 6 cases of colonization were found. Up to March 2015, there have been five other sporadic cases, bringing a total of 7 confirmed CRE infections, and 12 colonised cases. Of these 7 cases, 6 were female, 4 infants and 2 died. Two of the 7 cases had positive Hodge test; one had New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM), one Guiana Extended-Spectrum (GES) gene while five tested negative for carbapenemases. All 7 cases had previous carbapenem exposure, five of which received colistin monotherapy. We noted an increasing utilisation of carbapenems and colistin coinciding with this period of emerging carbapenem resistance. Conclusion The emergence of CRE is increasingly undermining the use of carbapenems.

14373,YES,Moremi2016,Article,"Introduction: The species Achromobacter animicus first described in 2013 has been isolated from sputum of humans suffering from respiratory infections. Literature regarding A. animicus is limited. Herein we document first case of A. animicus wound infections. Objective: To characterize a multidrug-resistant A. animicus isolated from chronic posttraumatic wound infection in a street child from African continent. Materials and Methods: Phenotypic identification of the organism was performed using gram staining, culture on Blood and MacConkey Agars and VITEK{\textregistered}-MS. Further taxonomic identification was done by sequencing of the complete 16S rRNA gene and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) of 7 housekeeping genes. Antimicrobial Susceptibility testing and extended spectrum beta lactamase production was confirmed using VITEK{\textregistered} 2 system and E-Test respectively. Result: The isolate was phenotypically identified as a gramnegative bacterium with inconclusive genus. The complete 16S rRNA gene provided 99.6{\%}, 99.6{\%} and 99.7{\%} match with Achromobacter xylosoxidans (CP014065), Achromobacter denitrificans (CP013923) and Achromobacter animicus (NR-117615) respectively. The MLST unveiled 4 new alleles, i.e. gltB-82, lepA-114, nrdA-99 and nuoL-92, that resulted into the new sequence type ST-320, which was closely related to other A. animicus genotypes. Single locus sequencing of nrdA-765 gene confirmed the isolate to be A. animicus. The isolate was found to be resistant to ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and tetracycline, but susceptible to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, imipenem, meropenem, and ertapenem, and intermediate susceptible to moxifloxacin. Conclusion: For the first time, this case report highlights the role of multidrug- resistant A. animicus in causing wound infections which is important information to clinicians and clinical microbiologist. There is a need to improve microbiological services in developing countries in order to identify uncommon human pathogens. This will assist in updating the database of automated identification systems; simplifying identification of these pathogens and track their epidemiology.",N Moremi and H Claus and M Hingi and U Vogel and S E Mshana,1618-0607,International Journal of Medical Microbiology,"Achromobacter xylosoxidans,Gram staining,RNA 16S,Tanzania,allele,ampicillin,antibiotic sensitivity,blood,case report,cefotaxime,ceftazidime,child,ciprofloxacin,cotrimoxazole,data base,developing country,doctor patient relation,endogenous compound,epsilometer test,ertapenem,extended spectrum beta lactamase,gene expression,genotype,gentamicin,genus,homelessness,housekeeping gene,human,imipenem,meropenem,microbiology,moxifloxacin,multilocus sequence typing,nonhuman,piperacillin plus tazobactam,tetracycline,wound infection",11,"{Multidrug-resistant Achromobacter animicus causing wound infection in a street child in Mwanza, Tanzania}",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L614104788 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmm.2016.11.008 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=16180607{\&}id=doi:10.1016{\%}2Fj.ijmm.2016.11.008{\&}atitle=Multidrug-re,306,2016,8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,MAYBE,Cale,YES,Ayomide,Ayomide,Zach,yes,,

A national alert was triggered in September 2003 when 4 hospitals reported clusters of A. baumannii infection with similar susceptibility profiles. Case definitions and laboratory guidelines were disseminated, and prospective surveillance was implemented; strains were sent to a single laboratory for characterization and typing. From April 2003 through June 2004, 53 hospitals reported 290 cases of A. baumannii infection or colonization; 275 isolates were bla(VEB-1)-positive and clonally related. Cases were first reported in 5 districts of northern France, then in 10 other districts in 4 regions. Within a region, interhospital spread was associated with patient transfer. In northern France, investigation and control measures led to a reduction of reported cases after January 2004.

15013,MAYBE,Ngandjio2009,Article,"There was an outbreak of cholera in Cameroon during 2004 and 2005; the epidemic began in Douala in January 2004 and spread throughout the south of the country. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported 8005 cases in 2004 and 2847 cases in 2005. Five hundred eighty-nine stool samples were received in the Pasteur Centre of Cameroon and 352 were microbiologically confirmed to be positive for Vibrio cholerae O1. Isolated strains were tested for their antimicrobial susceptibilities. All the strains were multidrug resistant and predominantly showed a common resistance pattern at the beginning of the outbreak. Tetracycline, recommended by the WHO for treating cholera in adults, was effective against all the strains tested. Cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole), previously a first-line treatment in children, was ineffective in vitro for all the clinical isolates and was quickly replaced by amoxicillin. Ampicillin resistance emerged at the end of 2004 and was the leading resistance pattern observed in the second half of 2005. This therefore represented the second major resistance pattern. These two major resistance profiles were not associated with patient characteristics (sex and age) or to the geographic origin of strains. However, there was a highly significant relationship between resistance patterns and the year of isolation (p {\textless} 0.001). The strains possessed genes ctxA and ctxB encoding the two cholera toxin subunits and were very closely related, irrespective of their antimicrobial resistance patterns. They were not differentiated by molecular typing methods and gave similar ribotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns.",A Ngandjio and M Tejiokem and M Wouafo and I Ndome and M Yonga and A Guenole and L Lemee and M L Quilici and M C Fonkoua,1535-3141,Foodborne Pathogens and Disease,",*Drug Resistance,Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology,Bacterial,Bacterial/*analysis,Cameroon,Cameroon/epidemiology,Cholera/epidemiology/*microbiology,Colony Count,DNA,Disease Outbreaks,Electrophoresis,Feces/microbiology,Food Microbiology,Gel,Humans,Microbial,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Multiple,Polymerase Chain Reaction,Pulsed-Field,Ribotyping,Vibrio cholerae,Vibrio cholerae O1/*drug effects/genetics/isolatio,antiinfective agent,article,bacterial DNA,bacterial count,cholera,drug effect,epidemic,feces,food control,genetics,human,isolation and purification,microbiological examination,microbiology,multidrug resistance,polymerase chain reaction,pulsed field gel electrophoresis,ribotyping",49--56,{Antimicrobial resistance and molecular characterization of Vibrio cholerae O1 during the 2004 and 2005 outbreak of cholera in Cameroon},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L355857159 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=15567125{\&}id=doi:{\&}atitle=Antimicrobial+resistance+and+molecular+characterization+of+Vibrio+cholerae+O1+during+,6,2009,1,"From Duplicate 1 (Antimicrobial resistance and molecular characterization of Vibrio cholerae O1 during the 2004 and 2005 outbreak of cholera in Cameroon - Ngandjio, A; Tejiokem, M; Wouafo, M; Ndome, I; Yonga, M; Guenole, A; Lemee, L; Quilici, M L; Fonkoua, M C)

Serbia has been designated as an endemic region for isolates carrying the blaNDM-1 gene, as well as one of several commonly proposed countries of origin. This is the first report of NDM-1-positive Escherichia coli from Serbia. A carbapenem-resistant clinical isolate of E. coli strain IMD989, isolated from the blood culture of a pediatric patient with leukemia, was subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility tests, molecular typing, and conjugation experiments. The strain exhibited resistance to meropenem and was classified as a novel sequence type, ST5123, belonging to E. coli phylogenetic group A. ST5123 showed similarity to veterinary isolates ST93 and ST3977. The blaNDM-1 gene was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. Cloning and sequencing of genomic clones confirmed that strain IMD989 produces an NDM-1 variant. Conjugation experiments, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and Southern blot hybridization revealed that blaNDM-1 was located in IMD989 on a transmissible 80 kb plasmid, designated as pIMD989. PCR analysis confirmed that pIMD989 belongs to the IncF plasmid family.

The seemingly pathogenic role, with its concomitant resistance to the fluoroquinolone antibacterial agents, is worrisome to chemical microbiologist world over. The purpose of this study therefore, was to characterize the enterovirulent Escherichia coli strains isolated from diarrheic patients attending various hospitals in Benin City. Methods. Stools specimens from three hundred diarrheic patients comprising infants, below three years old and adults above three years of age., attending these hospital were cultured using routine methods in University of Benin Teaching Hospital. Enterovirulent Escherichia coli strains isolated from the specimens were identified to species levels by biotyping using the standard Methods. They were also subjected to serotyping using Escherichia coli anti-sera and were used according to the manufacturers instructions. Antibiotic susceptibility spectrum was carried out on the isolates using agar diffusion methods of stokes. R-Plasmid DNA analysis was also carried out on the strains using alkaline lysis protocol of Takahashi and Nagano. Results. Nine enterovirulent strains were isolated from the specimens and exhibited very high minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) to the fluoroquinolones antibacterial agent and some other antibiotics and were thus screened for the presence of Transferable conjugate R-Plamid mediated resistance. The R-plasmid DNA analysis showed two bands greater than 23.1KB compared with the reference molecular weight plasmid, as revealed by agarrose gel electrophoresis on a horiszontal apparatus.

17078,MAYBE,Quinones2014,Article,"This work summarized the results obtained in an institutional Klebsiella pneumoniae surveillance program recently implemented in Cuba. Eighteen hospitals from five regions provided a total of 228 K. pneumoniae isolates (164 from admitted patients, four from hospital environmental sources, and 60 isolates from community patients). The genetic relationship was assessed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the agar dilution method, and bla(ESBL) genes were sequenced. Fifty four K. pneumoniae isolates were extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL)-producers (23.6{\%}), mostly due to the CTX-M-15 enzyme (79.6{\%}). ESBL isolates were grouped in 27 different sequence types (STs), being the most prevalent ST15 (15{\%}), ST152 (13{\%}), and both ST48 and ST147 (11{\%}, respectively). Community-acquired criteria could be demonstrated in 60 patients (26{\%}) corresponding to urological (33{\%}), wound (27{\%}), respiratory (27{\%}), and otic (13{\%}) infections.

This article describes the isolation of a strictly anaerobic strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis in pure culture from the site of an infected prosthetic hip. This isolate was unique in that it grew only under strictly anaerobic conditions. Initially, the isolate was thought to be a known anaerobic gram-positive coccus. However, certain key biochemical and antimicrobial tests performed as part of the standard laboratory identification procedure were not consistent with results expected for any known anaerobic gram-positive coccus; the isolate was catalase positive and metronidazole and penicillin resistant.

18203,MAYBE,Salimnia2011,Article,"We report the first case of Weissella confusa bacteremia in an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant patient. After engraftment and discharge, the patient returned with fever and graft failure and was started on an empiric regimen of aztreonam and vancomycin. A blood culture grew an alpha-hemolytic, gram-positive coccus forming pairs and chains, originally thought to be a viridans Streptococcus and a skin contaminant. The isolation of the organism from multiple blood cultures, and the presence of vancomycin resistance prompted identification and additional susceptibility testing. The RapID‚Ñ¢ Str panel, which has W. confusa in its database, provided multiple incorrect identifications. The MicroScan WalkAway 96 SI, using PC-20 or -29 panels, also did not identify this bacterium, because it is not in their database. The organism was identified as W. confusa by 16S rDNA sequencing. Antibiotic susceptibility determination by Etest revealed vancomycin resistance and daptomycin susceptibility. Therapy was changed to daptomycin, and the infection resolved. Additionally, W. confusa sepsis, with multiple positive blood cultures, developed in a patient in the burn unit at our medical center. The patient's blood cultures remained positive until vancomycin was discontinued and daptomycin therapy initiated. Infections with vancomycin-resistant, gram-positive cocci are emerging among immuno compromised hosts. Under appropriate circumstances, clinicians need to request that the laboratory perform susceptibility testing and accurate identification, by nucleic acid sequencing if necessary.

18250,MAYBE,Samia2014,Article,"BACKGROUND: Carbapenemantibiotics are used as the last line of treatment for infections caused by Enterobacteriaceae multidrug-resistant. However, the emergence of bacteria resistant to this important group of drug is jeopardizing the use of carbapenems. Resistance to carbapenems is due to production of enzymes Carbapenemases. Another important cause among carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) is over production of ESBL (extended spectrum $\beta$-lactamases) or Amp C enzyme in organism with porin loss. Phenotypic detection of CRE is important for proper infection control and appropriate patient management. The present study detects CRE by simple phenotypic method. METHODS: The study was a prospective study carried out at the Laboratory of Microbiology, at the university hospital center of Blida, from January 2012 to January 2014. The susceptibility to antibiotics was carried out according to recommendations of Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute by: disk diffusion method, search of ESBL and evaluation of the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC). Resistance of Enterobacteriaceae to carbapenems was defined as any strain that shows: ‚àódiameter of the inhibition zone to Imipenem {\textless}22 mm and/or Ertapenem {\textless}21 mm ‚àóPresence of discrete colonies in the inhibition zone of carbapenems ‚àóMIC to carbapenems {\textgreater}2$\mu$g/ml or MIC to Ertapenem {\textgreater}0.5$\mu$g/ml All CRE isolates were tested by phenotypic method: Modified Hodge test (MHT) and EDTA test. RESULTS: During the study period, total of 1323 strains of Enterobacteriaceae were included.14 strains were resistant to carbapenem. The prevalence of CRE in our hospital is 0,01{\%}. These included 8 resistant strains of Enterobacterspp, 4 strains of Klebsiella spp and 2 strains of Morganellamorganii. 15 strains were resistant to carbapenems by both disk-diffusion and MIC. None of the strains among the CRE isolates showed production of ESBL enzyme. 1 of the isolates (CRE) was MLB producer (EDTA+), 5 of these isolates showed positive result in MHT. CONCLUSIONS: The emergence and the dissemination of CRE is an important threat to public health. CRE and, in particular, those with carbapenemases, are an emerging infection problem at the Blida university hospital center.

18733,MAYBE,Seara2015,Article,"Abstract This study describes an interhospital spread of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) producing NDM-7 carbapenemase that started in December 2013 in Madrid, Spain. NDM-7-producing CRKP were isolated from urine, rectal swabs or blood samples from seven patients admitted to three different hospitals (Hospital Universitario La Paz, Hospital de Cantoblanco and Hospital Central de la Cruz Roja). The isolates were resistant to all antimicrobials tested except colistin and fosfomycin. One blood isolate was susceptible to minocycline and tigecycline but was resistant to fosfomycin. All isolates were closely related by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and DiversiLab{\textregistered} analysis and belonged to multilocus sequence typing (MLST) sequence type 437. In addition, blaNDM-7, blaTEM-1, blaCTX-M-15 and aac(3)-IIa were identified. Family contacts of the index case were negative for NDM-producing bacteria. The outbreak occurred in two separate waves and the cases associated with Hospital de Cantoblanco had been admitted to the same room. Environmental samples from the trap of a sink and a shower in this room were positive for NDM-7-producing CRKP. To our knowledge, this is the first reported worldwide outbreak of NDM-7-producing CRKP. No relationship with the Indian continent, the Balkans or the Middle East could be established. Frequent transfer of aged or chronically ill patients between the facilities involved may have favoured the spread of NDM-7-producing CRKP. The spread of the second wave in Hospital de Cantoblanco probably occurred as a result of transmission from an environmental reservoir.",N Seara and J Oteo and R Carrillo and V Perez-Blanco and J Mingorance and R Gomez-Gil and R Herruzo and M Perez-Vazquez and J Astray and J Garcia-Rodriguez and L M Ruiz-Velasco and J Campos and C {de Burgos} and G Ruiz-Carrascoso and V P√©rez-Blanco and J Mingorance and R G√≥mez-Gil and R Herruzo and M P√©rez-V√°zquez and J Astray and J Garc\'{i}a-Rodr\'{i}guez and L M Ruiz-Velasco and J Campos and C {de Burgos} and G Ruiz-Carrascoso,"1872-7913

19684,YES,Sonnevend2011,Article,"Objectives: The aim of the study was to analyse the mechanisms responsible for carbapenem resistance in Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates recovered from sputum samples of two patients admitted to the same ward in a tertiary care hospital of the United Arab Emirates. Methods: Species identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing were performed using VITEK 2. MBL production was confirmed by E-test. The presence of blaNDM1 was detected by PCR and confirmed by direct sequencing of the amplicon. Plasmid analysis was conducted using the alkaline lysis method. Conjugative transfer of $\beta$-lactam resistance genes was carried out using an azide-resistant derivative of E. coli J53 as recipient. Molecular fingerprints of the isolates were obtained by ERIC PCR and PFGE analysis. Results: A 72-year old patient had transurethral prostate resection in India one month prior being admitted to Tawam Hospital for treatment of pulmonary oedema and sepsis. His sputum sample yielded an NDM-1 producer K. pneumoniae on admission (KP52). The 26-year old second patient was admitted for the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia 9 days after the first patient. He did not carry any multidrug resistant bacterium on admission; neither did he travel outside of the UAE. He was treated at the hospital's ICU in a room adjacent to the first patient's for 7 days. By the 9th day of his hospital stay, while being neutropenic, he developed pneumonia caused by an NDM-1 producer K. pneumoniae (KP53). His condition progressed to multi organ failure and he died on the 18th day of hospitalization. Both isolates were resistant to all antibiotics tested except tetracycline and colistin. A 379 bp long segment of blaNDM1 (identical to GenBank FN396876.1 sequence) was detected in both isolates located on a 50kb conjugative plasmid conferring resistance to $\beta$-lactam antibiotics, only. The identical molecular fingerprint of the two isolates suggests a direct link between the two cases and strains. Conclusion: This is the first description of blaNDM1 harbouring bacterium in the United Arab Emirates. The study also demonstrates the possibility of nosocomial spread of a NDM-1 producer K. pneumoniae.

The aim of the study was to analyse the structure of the integron containing the MBL gene. Methods: MICs were determined by the broth microdilution method. PCR assays and nucleotide sequencing were used for identification of bla gene types and mapping of the integron carrying the MBL gene. The location of the MBL allele was investigated by mating experiments and plasmid analysis as well as by Southern blotting of the plasmid extract and gene-specific hybridization with a blaVIM-1 probe. Results: The strain contained In 3Mor, a novel class 1 integron carrying a carbapenemase gene (blaVIM-1) associated with a trimethoprim (dfrA1), a streptothricin (sat1) and two aminoglycoside resistance genes (aacA7 and aadA1). Conjugation experiments failed to detect a transferable MBL determinant and plasmid DNA was not visualized. The chromosomal location of blaVIM-1 was confirmed after hybridization of the chromosomal band with the blaVIM-1 probe. Conclusions: Production of a VIM-type MBL ina M. morganii clinical isolate is documented in this study for the first time. Also, the dfrA1-sat1-aadA1 array which is typically described in the variable region of class 2 integrons consistent with that on Tn7 transposons, is originally detected herein in a class 1 integron. {\textcopyright} The Author 2007.

23217,MAYBE,Yuan2012,Article,"In this study, a total of 77 multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant (MDR and XDR, respectively) isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis were characterized among samples from patients living in Jiangxi province, China. The following two approaches were used: (i) genotyping all drug-resistant isolates by the 15-locus MIRU-VNTR (mycobacterial interspersed repetitive-unit-variable-number tandem-repeat) method and identifying the Beijing family genotype using the RD105 deletion targeted multiplex PCR and (ii) determining the mutation profiles associated with the resistance to the first-line antituberculous drugs rifampin (RIF) and isoniazid (INH) and the second-line drugs ofloxacin (OFX), kanamycin (KAN), amikacin (AMK), and capreomycin (CAP) with DNA sequencing. Six loci were examined: rpoB (for resistance to RIF), katG and mabA-inhA (INH), gyrA and gyrB (OFX), and rrs (KAN, AMK, and CAP). It is shown that the Beijing genotype was predominant (80.5{\%}) among these strains and that the selected drug-resistant strains were genetically diverse, suggesting that they probably had independently acquired drug resistance. In comparison to the phenotypic data, the sensitivities for the detection of RIF, INH, OFX, and KAN/AMK/CAP resistance by DNA sequencing were 94.8, 80.5, 84.6, and 78.9{\%}, respectively. The most prevalent mutations involved in RIF, INH, OFX, and KAN/AMK/CAP resistance were Ser531Leu in rpoB (44.2{\%}), Ser315Thr in katG (55.8{\%}) and C-15T in mabA-inhA (11.7{\%}), Asp94Gly in gyrA (48.7{\%}), and A1401G in rrs (73.7{\%}), respectively. Five novel katG mutants (Trp191Stop, Thr271Pro, Trp328Phe, Leu546Pro, and Asp695Gly) and six new alleles (Ile569Val, Ile572Met, Phe584Ser, Val615Met, Asp626Glu, and Lys972Thr) in the rpoB gene were identified.",X Yuan and T Zhang and K Kawakami and J Zhu and H Li and J Lei and S Tu,0095-1137,J Clin Microbiol,"*Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial,Adolescent,Adult,Aged,Antitubercular Agents/pharmacology,China,Female,Genetic Variation,Humans,Male,Microbial Sensitivity Tests/methods,Middle Aged,Molecular Sequence Data,Molecular Typing/methods,Mutation, Missense,Mycobacterium tuberculosis/*classification/*geneti,Sequence Analysis, DNA,Tuberculosis, Multidrug-Resistant/*microbiology,Young Adult",2404--2413,"{Molecular characterization of multidrug- and extensively drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains in Jiangxi, China}",NA,50,2012,7,"1098-660x

23549,YES,Zhou2012a,Article,"New Delhi metallo-$\beta$-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) is a novel type of metallo-$\beta$-lactamase (MBL) responsible for bacterial resistance to $\beta$-lactam antibiotics. Acinetobacter junii was previously shown to possess a MBL phenotype; however, the genes responsible for this phenotype were not identified. In this study, we reported the identification of NDM-1 gene in a clinical isolate of A. junii from a child patient in China, which was resistant to all $\beta$-lactams except aztreonam but sensitive to aminoglycosides and quinolones. The cloned NDM-1 gene contained an open reading frame of 813 bp and had a nucleotide sequence 99.9{\%} identical (812/813) to reported NDM-1 genes carried by Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Recombinant NDM-1 protein was successfully expressed in E. coli BL21, and antibiotic sensitivities of the NDM-1-producing E. coli were largely similar to the A. junii 1454 isolate. The findings of this study raise attention to the emergence and spread of NDM-1-carrying bacteria in China.",Z Zhou and R Guan and Y Yang and L Chen and J Fu and Q Deng and Y Xie and Y Huang and J Wang and D Wang and C Liao and S Gong and H Xia,0008-4166,Canadian Journal of Microbiology,",Acinetobacter Infections/microbiology,Acinetobacter baumannii,Acinetobacter infection,Acinetobacter junii,Acinetobacter/drug effects/*enzymology/isolation {\&},Adolescent,Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology,China,Enterococcus faecium,Escherichia coli,Escherichia coli/drug effects/genetics,Humans,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Male,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Recombinant Proteins/genetics,adolescent,amikacin,ampicillin,antibiotic resistance,antibiotic sensitivity,aztreonam,bacterium isolate,beta-Lactamases/chemistry/*genetics,beta-Lactams/pharmacology,case report,cefazolin,cefepime,cefoperazone,cefotetan,ceftazidime,ceftriaxone,ciprofloxacin,cotrimoxazole,ertapenem,gentamicin,human,imipenem,levofloxacin,linezolid,male,metallo beta lactamase,minimum inhibitory concentration,nitrofurantoin,nonhuman,note,open reading frame,phenotype,priority journal,sulbactam,tobramycin",112--115,{Identification of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase gene (NDM-1) from a clinical isolate of Acinetobacter junii in China},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L364062016 http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/W11-112 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=00084166{\&}id=doi:10.1139{\%}2FW11-112{\&}atitle=Identification+of+New+Delhi+metall,58,2012,1,"From Duplicate 2 (Identification of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase gene (NDM-1) from a clinical isolate of Acinetobacter junii in China - Zhou, Z; Guan, R; Yang, Y; Chen, L; Fu, J; Deng, Q; Xie, Y; Huang, Y; Wang, J; Wang, D; Liao, C; Gong, S; Xia, H)

23564,MAYBE,Zhu2008a,Article,"Five of the seven cases of vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA) infection identified to date have occurred in southeastern Michigan. VRSA isolates from the four most recent cases (all from Michigan) were characterized. The vanA gene was localized to a single plasmid in each VRSA isolate. The pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns of chromosomal DNA and the restriction profile of the plasmid demonstrated that the four isolates were unique and differed from the first three VRSA isolates. Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) isolates, all of which were Enterococcus faecalis, were recovered from case patients 4 to 6. Each VRE isolate transferred vancomycin resistance to E. faecalis JH2-2 by conjugation. PCRs for vanA and the Inc18-like plasmid genes traA and repR confirmed the presence of an Inc18-like vanA plasmid in all VRE isolates and transconjugants. An Inc18-like vanA plasmid was identified in the VRSA isolate from case patient 7. These findings suggest a role of Inc18-like plasmids as vanA donors.",W Zhu and N C Clark and L K McDougal and J Hageman and L C McDonald and J B Patel,"0066-4804 (Print)
