Among them, 34 (30.6{\%}) strains, isolated within 2 hospitals (A and B), exhibited nonsusceptibility to cefotaxime with significant reduction of MIC ({\textgreater} or = 3 log2 dilution) by the effect of clavulanic acid, which confirmed the phenotype of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). These ESBL producers were coresistant to gentamicin, isepamicin, and amikacin, but remained susceptible to ceftazidime (MIC, {\textless} or = 0.5 microg/mL) and meropenem (MIC, {\textless}0.5 microg/mL). By isoelectric focusing analysis, polymerase chain reaction, and nucleotide sequencing, we detected the presence of CTX-M-14 in 33 strains and CTX-M-3 in 6 strains (5 strains harboring both CTX-M-14 and CTX-M-3 enzymes). These beta-lactamase genes can be successfully transferred by the conjugative plasmid. Molecular epidemiology of the 34 ESBL-producing P. mirabilis strains by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis using SfiI restriction enzyme revealed 9 different genotypes, suggesting epidemic clones with intra- and interhospital spread. In conclusion, the broadly extended clonal spreading of CTX-M-type P. mirabilis was first discovered at the district hospitals in Taiwan.",L T Wu and H J Wu and J G Chung and Y C Chuang and K C Cheng and W L Yu,"0732-8893 (Print)0732-8893",Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis,"Bacterial Proteins/analysis/genetics,Biomarkers,Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field,Genome, Bacterial,Genotype,Hospitals, District,Humans,Lactams/pharmacology,Molecular Epidemiology,Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length,Proteus Infections/*epidemiology/*microbiology,Proteus mirabilis/drug effects/*enzymology/isolati,Respiratory Tract Infections/epidemiology/microbio,Taiwan,Urinary Tract Infections/epidemiology/microbiology,beta-Lactam Resistance/*genetics,beta-Lactamases/analysis/*genetics",89--94,{Dissemination of Proteus mirabilis isolates harboring CTX-M-14 and CTX-M-3 beta-lactamases at 2 hospitals in Taiwan},NA,54,2006,2,"Wu, Lii-TzuWu, Hwa-JenChung, Jing-GungChuang, Yin-ChingCheng, Kuo-ChenYu, Wen-LiangJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tUnited StatesDiagn Microbiol Infect Dis. 2006 Feb;54(2):89-94.

As other macrolides it inhibits bacterial proteins synthesis by binding with V domene of bacterial 23S rRNA. Resistance to azithromycin can be related to: 1. Mutations in gene encoding 23S rRNA. Significant effect on azithromycin MIC (minimal inhibitory concentration) is not observed when the mutation occurs only in 1 allele. In case of mutations occurring in 4 alleles, more common mutation C2611T is associated with MIC 2-16 mg/L and the second mutation A2059T results in high level resistance to azithromycin MIC {\textgreater} 256 mg/l 2. Over- production of membrane pumps proteins MtrCDE and MacAB, that remove antibiotics from bacterial cells. The mechanism is not able to cause azithromycin resistance itself but coexisting with other mechanisms of resistance can additionally increase MIC. 3. Synthesis of 23S rRNA methylases ErmB, ErmF, ErmC, ErmA. These enzymes cause demethylation of adenine (A2058) in V domain of 23S rRNA. The mechanism was common in the past, but it has been replaced by mutations in in V domain of 23S rRNA. Nowadays 23S rRNA methylases are very rare in N. gonorhoeae. METHODS: Sixty five Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains isolated from patients of the Department of Dermatology and Venereology in Warsaw in the second half of 2012 and first of 2013 were investigated. The strains were cultured on chocolate agar plates in a 5{\%} CO2 atmosphere at 37 degrees C and identified by colony morphology, Gram staining and oxidase reaction, followed by carbohydrate utilization test. Azithromycin susceptibility was determined by E-Tests (bioMerieux). Bacteria were incubated at 37 degrees C in 5{\%} CO2 for 24 h on chocolate agar plates. Tests were performed according to producers recommendations. The results (sensitive or resistant) were interpreted according to EUCAST recommendations. RESULTS: The MIC of azithromycin in investigated strains ranged from 0,064 to 4 mg/L, MIC50 = 0.5 mg/L, MIC90 = 2 mg/L. It was shown that only 38.5{\%} of the strains were sensitive to azithromycin according to EUCAST criteria from 2014 year and 89.3{\%} of the strains were sensitive to azithromycin according to CDC criteria from 2014 year. CONCLUSIONS: The percentage of azithromycin resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains is increasing in Poland and the antibiotic should not be used in monotherapy as gonorrhoea patients. It should only be used in combination with ceftriaxone or cefixime.",B Mlynarczyk-Bonikowska and M Kujawa and G Mlynarczyk and M Malejczyk and S Majewski,"0025-8601 (Print)0025-8601",Med Dosw Mikrobiol,"*Drug Resistance, Bacterial/genetics,Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology,Azithromycin/*pharmacology,Humans,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Mutation,Neisseria gonorrhoeae/classification/*drug effects,Poland,RNA, Bacterial/genetics,RNA, Ribosomal, 23S/genetics,Species Specificity",209--214,{[Resistance to azithromycin of Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains isolated in Poland in 2012-2013 years]},NA,66,2014,4-Mar,"Mlynarczyk-Bonikowska, BeataKujawa, MarlenaMlynarczyk, GrazynaMalejczyk, MagdalenaMajewski, SlawomirEnglish AbstractJournal ArticlePolandMed Dosw Mikrobiol. 2014;66(3-4):209-14.",NA,1/1/14,pol,25804074,YES,Erica,YES,Nchedo,Nchedo,Mushtaq,no,no access,3095,YES,Carattoli2013,Article,"We describe the first isolation of an NDM-1-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Italy.

We isolated two qnrA3-positive strains, one of Klebsiella pneumoniae (He96) and one of Kluyvera ascorbata (Kas96), from the feces of an immunocompromised outpatient. The qnrA3 allele was identical to that of S. algae except for 5 nucleotides and differed from qnrA1 by 29 nucleotides affecting three amino acids.

Hypothesis: Resistant microorganisms predominate in HA-BSIs in Greek ICUs. Methods: Secondary analysis of data collected during EUROBACT study, a large prospective, observational, multicenter study conducted in 162 ICUs of 24 countries worldwide. First episodes of HA-BSI acquired in the ICU or within 48 hours prior to ICU admission were recorded. Results: Twenty nine Greek ICUs contributed 288 episodes of HA-BSIs. Mean age (SD) was 59.5 (17.9) years; mean (SD) SAPS II was 48.1 (14.1) at ICU admission, and SOFA 8.3 (3.8) at HA-BSI onset. The commonest pathogens were Acinetobacter sp (84/329 isolates; 25.5{\%}), Klebsiella sp (23.4{\%}), Pseudomonas sp (12.2{\%}), and Enterococcus sp (7{\%}); 37 (12.8{\%}) episodes were polymicrobial. Among monomicrobial cases (n=251), 184 (73.3{\%}) were Gram-negative (GNB), 46 (18.3{\%}) Gram-positive (GPC), 19 (7.6{\%}) fungal, and 2 (0.8{\%}) anaerobes. Overall, 241 (73.3{\%}) isolates were classified as multidrug resistant (MDR), 155 (47.1{\%}) extensively resistant (XDR), 4 (1.2{\%}) as pan-drug resistant (PDR); 59.5{\%} GNB and 13{\%} enterococci were resistant to carbapenems and glycopeptides, respectively. Carbapenems were the most frequently empirically prescribed antibiotics, while colistin was the most frequently adequate. Overall 28-day all cause mortality was 33.3{\%} (G 33.7{\%}, GPC30.4{\%}, fungi61.9{\%}, polymicrobial18.9{\%}). In the multivariate analysis, factors adversely affecting outcome were higher SOFA at HA-BSI onset ([per point] OR1.188; 95{\%}CI 1.08-1.31, p=0.0006), need for renal support (OR2.75; 95{\%}CI 1.35-5.59, p=0.0053), and for vasopressors/inotropes (OR2.68; CI 1.18-6.12, p=0.02), whereas adequate empiric treatment had a protective effect (OR 0.48; CI 0.24-0.95, p= 0.03).

All SCVs were coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) with Staphylococcus epidermidis as the predominant species; there was also one Staphylococcus warneri SCV. The SCVs were auxotrophic for haemin, with one strain additionally auxotrophic for menadione. We noted the presence of two phenotypically (differences concerning antimicrobial susceptibility) and genetically distinct SCV strains in one patient, as well as the growth of two genetically related SCVs that differed in terms of their morphology and the type of auxotrophy in another. Seven out of eight SCVs were resistant to meticillin and gentamicin. In addition, antibiotic sensitivity testing revealed three multidrug-resistant SCV-normal-morphology isolate pairs. One S. epidermidis SCV harboured icaADBC genes and was found to be a proficient biofilm producer. This paper highlights the involvement of CNS SCVs in the aetiology of PJIs, including what is believed to be the first report of a S. warneri SCV. These subpopulations must be actively sought in the routine diagnosis of implant-associated infections. Moreover, in view of the phenotypic and genetic diversity of some SCV pairs, particular attention should be paid to the investigation of all types of observed colony morphologies, and isolates should be subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing.",A Bogut and J Niedźwiadek and M Kozioł-Montewka and D Strzelec-Nowak and J Blacha and T Mazurkiewicz and W Marczyński and D Plewik and J Niedzwiadek and M Koziol-Montewka and D Strzelec-Nowak and J Blacha and T Mazurkiewicz and W Marczynski and D Plewik,0022-2615,Journal of Medical Microbiology,",Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology,Arthritis/*microbiology,Biofilms/growth {\&} development,Cluster Analysis,Coagulase/secretion,Hemin/metabolism,Humans,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Molecular Typing,Prosthesis-Related Infections/*microbiology,Staphylococcal Infections/*microbiology,Staphylococcus epidermidis,Staphylococcus warneri,Staphylococcus/drug effects/growth {\&} development/i,Virulence Factors/genetics,antibiotic sensitivity,article,auxotrophy,bacterium isolate,biofilm,clinical article,controlled study,genetic variability,human,nonhuman,phenotype,priority journal,prosthesis infection,prosthesis loosening,prosthetic joint infection,purification/*physiology,small colony variant,total hip prosthesis",176--185,{Characterization of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphyloccocus warneri small-colony variants associated with prosthetic-joint infections},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L372198771 http://dx.doi.org/10.1099/jmm.0.066068-0 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=00222615{\&}id=doi:10.1099{\%}2Fjmm.0.066068-0{\&}atitle=Characterization+of+,63,2014,Pt 2,"From Duplicate 1 (Characterization of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphyloccocus warneri small-colony variants associated with prosthetic-joint infections - Bogut, A; Niedzwiadek, J; Koziol-Montewka, M; Strzelec-Nowak, D; Blacha, J; Mazurkiewicz, T; Marczynski, W; Plewik, D)1473-5644Bogut, AgnieszkaNiedzwiadek, JustynaKoziol-Montewka, MariaStrzelec-Nowak, DagmaraBlacha, JanMazurkiewicz, TomaszMarczynski, WojciechPlewik, DorotaJournal ArticleEnglandJ Med Microbiol. 2014 Feb;63(Pt 2):176-85. doi: 10.1099/jmm.0.066068-0.

It may cause epidemic outbreaks of serious systemic infections in hospital in-patients with a high degree of frailty and a large number of comorbidities. Its intrinsic resistance to almost every antibiotic therapy makes these infections particularly difficult to treat, with a documented mortality rate next to 60{\%}. The first epidemic outbreak in Italy was described in 2009,while our hospitalwas involved for the first time in July 2011. The aims of this research were therefore to describe the characteristics of a KPC outbreak in a subacute critical care ward and to assess the effect of sanitary measures (bed isolation vs cohort isolation). Materials and methods: At InternalMedicine and Critical Subacute Care Unit of Parma University Hospital we consecutively studied all patients infected by KPC (133 patients, M 75, F 58, mean age 79± 12 years) from August 2011 toMay 2012.Werecordedmain diagnosis, comorbidities, length of hospital stay, outcome, and anatomical district of KPC isolation for all patients. Following Emilia-Romagna Regional Guidelines, all infected patients, all contacts of these patients and all bedridden patients of the same ward were subdued to a rectal tampon for KPC detection every 7 days. FromOctober 2011 to February 2012 we also activated a 14-bed isolation ward applying a staff cohorting management. In the previous and following periodwe instead applied the traditional contact isolation approach. Results: During the first two months of epidemic outbreak with the traditional contact isolation approach we observed 41 new cases (23 in the first month and 18 in the second month). The cases were limited to an average of 8 cases per month (range 3-13) in the following 5 months after the activation of the 14-bed staff cohorting ward. After the restoration of the usual contact isolation measures, we observed a newincrease in incidence rates (respectively 15 and 18 cases in April and May 2012). Mean length of hospital stay of KPC-positive patients was significantly longer than that of other patients admitted to our unit (35 ± 24 vs 18 ± 12 days, p {\textless} 0.001). Inmost cases, KPC was isolated in rectal tampon cultures. 29 patients out of 133 (14{\%}) deceased during hospital stay. Most of the deaths were attributable to septic shock and occurred in the first two months of the epidemic outbreak. The most prevalent comorbidities were cardiopathies (84/133 patients, 64{\%}) and COPD (72/133 patients, 54{\%}). Conclusions: KPC infection is quickly emerging as a relevant health issue, especially in elderly frail inpatients with multiple comorbidities. Mortality in our setting has however been lower than that described in the literature.

Carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae have been reported to an increasing extent, largely as a consequence of the acquisition of carbapenemase genes. The treatment of infections caused by Enterobacter cloacae and other enterobacteriaceae has become a troublesome clinical problem in the case of limited therapeutic options. Resistance to Carbapenem caused by Enterobacter cloacae and other enterobacteriaceae is relatively rare; therefore, this class of drugs is the last line of defense against multidrug-resistant Enterobacter cloacae for the treatment of severe infections. Unfortunately, increasing production of New Delhi metallo-$\beta$-lactamase 1 (NDM-1) has become established as a major public health threat and represents a new challenge in the treatment of infectious diseases. In this study, we describe the ability of Enterobacter cloacae to produce carbapenemase enzymes based on the results of Modified Hodge test and the biochemical Carba NP test performed according to guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). Furthermore, we assessed the presence of genes in charge of the production of carbapenemases (blaKPC, blaVIM, blaIMP, blaOXA-48, blaNDM) among Enterobacter cloacae. The tested isolate of Enterobacter cloacae that occupied the blaNDM-1 and blaVIM-19 genes were determined. To our knowledge, this is the first detection of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacter cloacae (n=4) consisted of sequence type 508 (ST508) with NDM-1 and VIM-19, ST509 with NDM-1, and ST145 with VIM-19 in china.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective survey was made over a period of twelve months (year 2009). It focused on 3564 patients with urinary tract infection confirmed by the Laboratory of Microbiology in the University Hospital, Mahdia. RESULTS: Klebsiella spp. was involved in 5.5{\%} (198/3564) of all cases of urinary tract infections identified. Klebsiella pneumoniae accounted for 94.9{\%} of all Klebsiella (5.1{\%} for Klebsiella oxytoca).

The cfr gene was first described in animal isolates of staphylococci, and more recently, it has been identified in Staphylococcus aureus from human clinical infections, including in an outbreak of methicillin-resistant S. aureus. In enterococci, cfr has been described in an animal isolate of Enterococcus faecalis from China. Here, we report an isolate of linezolid-resistant E. faecalis (603-50427X) recovered from a patient in Thailand who received prolonged therapy with the antibiotic for the treatment of atypical mycobacterial disease. The isolate lacked mutations in the genes coding for 23S rRNA and L3 and L4 ribosomal proteins and belonged to the multilocus sequence type (MLST) 16 (ST16), which is commonly found in enterococcal isolates from animal sources. Resistance to linezolid was associated with the presence of cfr on an {\~{}}97-kb transferable plasmid. The cfr gene environment exhibited DNA sequences similar to those of other cfr-carrying plasmids previously identified in staphylococci (nucleotide identity, 99 to 100{\%}). The cfr-carrying plasmid was transferable by conjugation to a laboratory strain of E. faecalis (OG1RF) but not to Enterococcus faecium or S. aureus. The cfr gene was flanked by IS256-like sequences both upstream and downstream.

After outbreak investigation, hygiene measures were implemented in all family households and childminders' homes. Several decontamination procedures were performed, which used a combination of topical mupirocin, total body application of chlorhexidine, chlorhexidine gargle (if {\textgreater}6 years old) and a course of antibiotic therapy in cases of infection or decontamination failure. Patients were followed up for MRSA skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) and carriage. Strains were characterised by antimicrobial drug resistance profile, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and DNA microarrays. Between June 2011 and June 2012, six children and six adults among the ten corresponding relatives developed 28 SSTIs. None of the family members, including the index case, had any contact with foreigners or individuals known to have SSTIs. After infection control measures and prolonged decontamination have been implemented with a high adherence, six patients remained sustained CA-MRSA USA300 carriers, including one who developed mupirocin resistance and six who experienced minor CA-MRSA-related SSTIs. A baby was identified as an MRSA carrier 2 months after delivery. CA-MRSA decontamination using mupirocin and chlorhexidine in the community setting may also be a questionable strategy, associated with failure and resistance to both agents.

The incidence was maximum in 2004 for MDR (63.39{\%}) and in 2005 for nosocomial organisms (63.63{\%}). The positive blood cultures were only in ICU patients. We had 337 samples and 122 were positive (36.20{\%}). The most frequent organism was MRSA (25.41{\%}). The strains of Acinctobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa had a maximum prevalence of 12.5{\%} in 2005 for both organisms; the eight-year average was 2.46 and 4.91, respectively. We examined 563 urine samples from surgery ward; 24.9{\%} were positive and 3243 samples from ICU, 17.4{\%} were positive. Other samples (451, from 1715 patients- abdominal fluids, fistulae, wounds, abscesses, tracheal discharge, cellulites) produced nosocomial and MDR organisms (in average 26.29{\%}). Bacterial cultures were done. We isolated 1115 strains. Disk diffusion tests were performed and communicated according to the CLSI standard. Average values for MRSA are 28.4{\%}, for Enterobacteria 15.2{\%}, for Pseudomonas aeruginosa 13.2{\%}, for Enterococcus spp. 9.3{\%} and for Acinctobacter baumannii 4.9{\%}. As a result of exhausted antibiotic arsenal in many situations, we estimate that first intention therapy adapted to the Carmeli score and followed by reevaluation after microbiologic results and antibiotic susceptibility testing can reduce the amount of MDR strains.

One patient lived in a nursing home and was never hospitalised, whereas the other patient was repeatedly hospitalised in this hospital. The aim of this study was to unveil the molecular mechanisms associated with the carbapenem resistance of these isolates and to assess its potential dissemination. Methods Isolate identification was performed by VITEK{\textregistered}2 and was confirmed by 16S rDNA sequencing. The clonal relationship of the isolates was evaluated by repetitive element palindromic PCR (rep-PCR). Antibiotic susceptibility was determined using the automatic VITEK{\textregistered}2 AES system and disk diffusion assay. $\beta$-Lactamases, porins and mobile genetic elements were characterised by PCR and sequencing. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and Southern blot hybridisation were used to determine the genetic location of integrons, and their transferability was tested by conjugation. Results No genetic relatedness was found, suggesting different origins of the isolates. In isolate Cf254 a VIM-2 carbapenemase integrated in In58 was detected, located in a high-frequency conjugative IncL/M plasmid that also carried CTX-M-15 and CMY-39 genes. VIM-1 in isolate Cf872 was chromosomal. This is the first description in Portugal of VIM carbapenemases in C. freundii. Loss/alteration of porins was also detected.

The pandemic sequence type (ST)8/pulsed-field gel type USA300 is the dominant CA-MRSA clone in the United States, but its evolutionary history and basis for biological success are incompletely understood. Here, we use whole-genome sequencing of 387 ST8 isolates drawn from an epidemiological network of CA-MRSA infections and colonizations in northern Manhattan to explore short-term evolution and transmission patterns. Phylogenetic analysis predicted that USA300 diverged from a most common recent ancestor around 1993. We found evidence for multiple introductions of USA300 and reconstructed the phylogeographic spread of isolates across neighborhoods. Using pair-wise single-nucleotide polymorphism distances as a measure of genetic relatedness between isolates, we observed that most USA300 isolates had become endemic in households, indicating their critical role as reservoirs for transmission and diversification. Using the maximum single-nucleotide polymorphism variability of isolates from within households as a threshold, we identified several possible transmission networks beyond households. Our study also revealed the evolution of a fluoroquinolone-resistant subpopulation in the mid-1990s and its subsequent expansion at a time of high-frequency outpatient antibiotic use. This high-resolution phylogenetic analysis of ST8 has documented the genomic changes associated with USA300 evolution and how some of its recent evolution has been shaped by antibiotic use.

Objective: To describe the clinical and epidemiological implications of 3 NDM-1 cases in Geneva. Methods: Retrospective case review with molecular identification. MICs of ertapenem, meropenem and imipenem were determined with Etests. ESBL production was tested using the cefotaxime-ceftazidime- clavulanic acid double-disc method. The presence of blaNDM-1 was determined by conventional PCR and DNA sequencing analysis with primers specific for blaNDM-1. Inhibition of blaNDM-1 activity was evaluated by disk approximation analysis. NDM-1 isolates were further investigated by PCR amplification to detect other resistance determinants. Results: Between December 2009 and January 2010, 3 NDM-1 isolates were identified at HUG belonging to three patients that were repatriated to Geneva after receiving medical treatment in India (1), Pakistan (2) and Serbia (3). On admission, patient 1 was a digestive carrier of E. coli blaNDM-1 and patient 3 had a urinary tract infection due to K. pneumoniae blaNDM-1. Patient 2 was discovered a digestive carrier of P. mirabilis blaNDM-1 only after extended hospitalization and antibiotic therapy. All patients carried other multiresistant organisms such as ESBL-producing Enterobacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Acinetobacter baumannii. Patient 1 harbored a highly resistant strain of E. coli blaNDM-1 showing in vitro susceptibility only to fosfomycine and tigecycline and a pan-resistant Acinetobacter blaNDM-1. Proteus blaNDM-1 (Patient 1) and K. pneumoniae blaNDM-1 (Patient 3) strains were also sensitive to ciprofloxacin. The patients were hospitalized in different wards; no cases of cross-transmission were identified due to early screening and preemptive isolation. The presence of NDM-1 was confirmed retrospectively after patient discharge.

The pathogen was an uncommon, multiresistant Escherichia coli strain of serotype O104:H4 which expressed a Shiga toxin characteristic of enterohemorrhagic E. coli and in addition virulence factors common to enteroaggregative E. coli. During post-epidemic surveillance of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) all but two of O104:H4 isolates were indistinguishable from the epidemic strain. Here we describe two novel STEC O104:H4 strains isolated in close spatiotemporal proximity to the outbreak which show a virulence gene panel, a Shiga toxin-mediated cytotoxicity towards Vero cells and aggregative adherence to Hep-2 cells comparable to the outbreak strain. They differ however both from the epidemic strain and from each other, by their antibiotic resistance phenotypes and some other features as determined by routine epidemiological subtyping methods. Whole genome sequencing of these two strains, of ten outbreak strain isolates originating from different time points of the outbreak and of one historical sporadic EHEC O104:H4 isolate was performed. Sequence analysis revealed a clear phylogenetic distance between the two variant strains and the outbreak strain finally identifying them as epidemiologically unrelated isolates from sporadic cases. These findings add to the knowledge about this emerging pathogen, illustrating a certain diversity within the bacterial core genome as well as loss and gain of accessory elements. Our results do also support the view that distinct new variants of STEC O104:H4 repeatedly might originate from yet unknown reservoirs, rather than that there would be a continuous diversification of a single epidemic strain established and circulating in Germany after the large outbreak in 2011.",E Tietze and P W Dabrowski and R Prager and A Radonic and A Fruth and P Aurass and A Nitsche and M Mielke and A Flieger,1932-6203,PLoS ONE,"*Shiga-Toxigenic Escherichia coli/classification/g,Animals,Bacterial Adhesion,Cercopithecus aethiops,DNA, Bacterial/genetics,Disease Outbreaks,Escherichia coli Infections/epidemiology/*microbio,Genome, Bacterial,Germany/epidemiology,Hep G2 Cells,Humans,Molecular Sequence Data,Phylogeny,Plasmids/genetics,Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide,Sequence Analysis, DNA,Serogroup,Vero Cells,Virulence/genetics",e0122074,{Comparative genomic analysis of two novel sporadic Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli O104:H4 strains isolated 2011 in Germany},NA,10,2015,4,"1932-6203Tietze, ErhardDabrowski, Piotr WojciechPrager, RitaRadonic, AleksandarFruth, AngelikaAurass, PhilippNitsche, AndreasMielke, MartinFlieger, AntjeComparative StudyJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tUnited StatesPLoS One. 2015 Apr 2;10(4):e0122074. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0122074. eCollection 2015.",10.1371/journal.pone.0122074,4/4/15,eng,25836671,YES,Melanie,MAYBE,Zach,Zach,Mushtaq,Downloaded,,12347,YES,Liu2013d,Article,"Four closely related KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae strains, which were isolated from the patients with neonatal sepsis, harbored bla(CTX-M-14), bla(TEM-1), bla(CTX-M-15), bla(SHV-11),bla(SHV-12), class 1 integron, qnrS1, acc(6')-Ib-cr, and rmtB genes.

We investigated the prevalence of NDM-1, in multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in India, Pakistan, and the UK. Methods: Enterobacteriaceae isolates were studied from two major centres in India-Chennai (south India), Haryana (north India)-and those referred to the UK's national reference laboratory. Antibiotic susceptibilities were assessed, and the presence of the carbapenem resistance gene blaNDM-1 was established by PCR. Isolates were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of XbaI-restricted genomic DNA. Plasmids were analysed by S1 nuclease digestion and PCR typing. Case data for UK patients were reviewed for evidence of travel and recent admission to hospitals in India or Pakistan. Findings: We identified 44 isolates with NDM-1 in Chennai, 26 in Haryana, 37 in the UK, and 73 in other sites in India and Pakistan. NDM-1 was mostly found among Escherichia coli (36) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (111), which were highly resistant to all antibiotics except to tigecycline and colistin. K pneumoniae isolates from Haryana were clonal but NDM-1 producers from the UK and Chennai were clonally diverse. Most isolates carried the NDM-1 gene on plasmids: those from UK and Chennai were readily transferable whereas those from Haryana were not conjugative. Many of the UK NDM-1 positive patients had travelled to India or Pakistan within the past year, or had links with these countries. Interpretation: The potential of NDM-1 to be a worldwide public health problem is great, and co-ordinated international surveillance is needed.

The use of fluoroquinolones, once considered the drugs of choice, should be re-evaluated due to the emergence of quinolone-resistant Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi. In Taiwan, typhoid fever is rare but constitutes an important public health concern. Methods: In August 2011, two ciprofloxacin-resistant S. Typhi isolates were identified from one patient who had recently travelled to India. The two isolates together with four other ciprofloxacin-susceptible S. Typhi isolates were subjected for molecular investigation. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing were used to analyze the resistance mechanisms. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was performed to delineate the genetic relatedness among the isolates. Results: In 2011, a total of 49 typhoid fever cases were reported to the Center for Disease Control in Taiwan, with a significant increase in indigenous cases in northern Taiwan from August to November. In the two S. Typhi isolates with complete resistance to ciprofloxacin [minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) {\textgreater}32$\mu$g/mL], multiple point mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) of gyrA and parC genes were identified. A unique PFGE pattern was found in the resistant isolates and was different from the other representative susceptible isolates. Conclusions: The first ciprofloxacin-resistant S. Typhi infection in Taiwan is reported. The emergence and spread of antimicrobial-resistant S. Typhi infection as a result of international travel may become a threat to public health in Taiwan. Clinicians should be well alert when treating patients who may have acquired resistant infections associated with international travel among endemic regions. {\textcopyright} 2013 .",C J Lee and L H Su and Y C Huang and C H Chiu,"1684-11821995-9133","Journal of Microbiology, Immunology and Infection",",*Drug Resistance,Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology,Bacterial,Bacterial/chemistry/genetics,Ciprofloxacin resistance,Ciprofloxacin/*pharmacology,DNA,DNA Gyrase/genetics,DNA Topoisomerase IV/genetics,DNA topoisomerase (ATP hydrolysing) A,Electrophoresis,Female,Gel,Genotype,Humans,India,International travel,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Missense,Mutation,Point Mutation,Polymerase Chain Reaction,Pulsed-Field,Quinolone resistance-determining regions,Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi,Salmonella typhi/*drug effects/genetics/*isolation,Sequence Analysis,Taiwan,Travel,Typhoid Fever/*microbiology,Young Adult,adult,ampicillin,antibiotic resistance,antibiotic sensitivity,article,bacterial gene,bacterium identification,bacterium isolate,bacterium isolation,case report,cefixime,ceftriaxone,chloramphenicol,ciprofloxacin,ciprofloxacin resistant Salmonella typhi,controlled study,cotrimoxazole,diarrhea,ertapenem,female,fever,flomoxef,gene identification,gene sequence,genetic similarity,human,imipenem,minimum inhibitory concentration,nonhuman,point mutation,polymerase chain reaction,protein ParC,pulsed field gel electrophoresis,quinolone,typhoid fever",469--473,{First isolation of ciprofloxacin-resistant Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi in Taiwan},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L52471489 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2013.01.002 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=16841182{\&}id=doi:10.1016{\%}2Fj.jmii.2013.01.002{\&}atitle=First+isolati,46,2013,6,"From Duplicate 1 (First isolation of ciprofloxacin-resistant Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi in Taiwan - Lee, C J; Su, L H; Huang, Y C; Chiu, C H)1995-9133Lee, Chia-JieSu, Lin-HuiHuang, Yhu-CheringChiu, Cheng-HsunCase ReportsJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tEnglandJ Microbiol Immunol Infect. 2013 Dec;46(6):469-73. doi: 10.1016/j.jmii.2013.01.002.

The aerosol administration allows high concentrations of tobramycin to be delivered to the site of infection with limited systemic absorption. In rare patients, systemic absorption of inhaled tobramycin may be significant enough to produce toxic effects, such as renal and vestibular toxicities. Case presentation: We report a patient with CF who developed recurrent eosinophilia and severe persistent bronchospasm following repeated administration of preservative-free tobramycin by inhalation, beginning at 16 months of age. Also, he developed similar signs and symptoms when he was administered tobramycin intravenously on one occasion at 5 1/2 years. The patient had a history of environmental allergies. Temporal sequence of his signs and symptoms after each administration of tobramycin (similar to re-challenge testing), and his improvement after discontinuation of the drug strongly suggest an adverse drug reaction. Conclusion: Hypersensitivity reaction should be considered in patients who develop recurrent eosinophilia and deterioration of pulmonary function following the use of tobramycin by inhalation or by intravenous administration. {\textcopyright} 2007 Santos et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",R P Santos and E Awa and R D Anbar,1471-2431,BMC Pediatrics,"Achromobacter xylosoxidans,Pseudomonas aeruginosa,Serratia marcescens,Staphylococcus aureus,airway obstruction,amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid,anamnesis,antibiotic agent,antibiotic resistance,antibody blood level,antibody titer,article,azithromycin,bacterial infection,bronchodilating agent,bronchospasm,budesonide,case report,ceftazidime,child,ciprofloxacin,computer assisted tomography,coughing,cromoglycate disodium,cystic fibrosis,differential diagnosis,dornase alfa,drug dose increase,drug treatment failure,drug withdrawal,enzyme replacement,eosinophil count,eosinophilia,familial disease,forced expiratory volume,human,immunoglobulin E,laboratory test,lung aspergillosis,lung function test,lung infiltrate,male,montelukast,multivitamin,nasal biopsy,nebulization,nonhuman,pancreas enzyme,pancreas insufficiency,pathogenesis,prednisolone,prednisone,recurrent disease,retreatment,salbutamol,sinusitis,thorax radiography,tobi,tobramycin,treatment response,upper respiratory tract infection,wheezing",NA,{Inhaled tobramycin solution-associated recurrent eosinophilia and severe persistent bronchospasm in a patient with cystic fibrosis: A case report},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L46420093 http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2431-7-11 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=14712431{\&}id=doi:10.1186{\%}2F1471-2431-7-11{\&}atitle=Inhaled+tobramycin+so,7,2007,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,MAYBE,Jake,NO,Ayomide,Mushtaq,Mushtaq,Downloaded,,3722,MAYBE,Chery2013,Article,"INTRODUCTION Lactobacillus species are probiotics proven to exhibit various preventative as well as therapeutic properties. While lactobacillus species have been implicated in the formation of dental caries, endocarditis and bacteremia, their role as pathogens in cholecystitis has not been reported. We present a rare case of Lactobacillus fermentum working as a pathogen in cholecystitis. PRESENTATION OF CASE An 81-year old male was admitted with right upper quadrant abdominal pain. His signs, symptoms, laboratory values and imaging were consistent with a diagnosis of cholecystitis with ascending cholangitis. In view of his co-morbidity and severe sepsis, the patient was treated non-operatively with antibiotics and cholecystostomy. L. fermentum, which was vancomycin resistant, was identified from the cholecystostomy aspirate and from anaerobic blood culture. The patient went into septic shock, developed multi-organ dysfunction syndrome and eventually died. DISCUSSION Commensal bacteria such as L. fermentum are known to modulate immunity, reduce the pathogenicity of gastrointestinal organisms and play a therapeutic role in various disease processes. We isolated L. fermentum as a pathogen in a documented case of cholecystitis with ascending cholangitis. CONCLUSION While the routine use lactobacillus species as a probiotic is supported in the literature, understanding its potential role as a pathogen may allow more judicious use of these bacteria and encourage research to elucidate the pathogenicity of lactobacillus species. {\textcopyright} 2013 Surgical Associates Ltd.",J Chery and D Dvoskin and F P Morato and B Fahoum,2210-2612,International Journal of Surgery Case Reports,"Candida,Lactobacillus fermentum,abdominal distension,abdominal tenderness,acute kidney failure,aged,agitation,alkaline phosphatase,alkaline phosphatase blood level,anemia,antibiotic therapy,article,ascites,aztreonam,bacterium culture,bacterium detection,bilirubin,blood clotting disorder,case report,cholecystitis,cholecystostomy,cholelithiasis,computer assisted tomography,creatinine,death,depression,deterioration,drug substitution,drug withdrawal,dysuria,echography,endotracheal intubation,eye jaundice,heart arrest,hemoglobin,hemoglobin blood level,human,hypertension,hypoxia,intensive care,international normalized ratio,leukocyte count,leukocytosis,linezolid,liver function test,magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography,male,metronidazole,nausea and vomiting,noradrenalin,physical examination,priority journal,sepsis,upper abdominal pain,urine culture,vasopressin",662--664,"{Lactobacillus fermentum, a pathogen in documented cholecystitis}",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L369196751 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2013.04.034 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=22102612{\&}id=doi:10.1016{\%}2Fj.ijscr.2013.04.034{\&}atitle=Lactobacil,4,2013,8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,MAYBE,Brooke,MAYBE,Zach,Zach,Mushtaq,Downloaded,,13177,MAYBE,Margate2015,Article,"In this brief communication we describe the occurrence of a KPC-producing Serratia marcescens isolate in a home-care patient from Recife, Brazil.

Most countries have reported an increase in CoNS infections in hospitalized patients that are resistant to methicillin and other antibiotics. Despite of it information of population structure and global epidemiology of Staphylococcus epidermidis and some other CoNS is scare. The goal of investigation was to analyze collection of CoNS from diverse clinical origins using molecular genotyping. Methods: CoNS isolates were recovered from the blood (36), umbilical wound (10), conjunctivitis (33), urine (1), pulmonary tissue (2) in 2009- 2010. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by standard methods. Species identification was carried out by amplification and sequencing of tuf gene. S. epidermidis isolates were analyzed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) by protocol, as described by Thomas J.C. et al. (2007). MLST of Staphylococcus haemolyticus isolates was performed using original primers sets. Structural components of staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) were tested by PCR additionally. Results: Identification of CoNS at the species level indicated that S. epidermidis was the most common species with 46 isolates, followed by S. haemolyticus (18), Staphylococcus hominis (10), Staphylococcus warneri (7), Staphylococcus pasteuri (1). 69 (84.2{\%}) isolates were methicillin-resistant. Among S. epidermidis isolates 24 ST were discovered, including 5 new. New alleles for 5 analysing genes were discovered two. ST59 was predominated (41.3{\%}. isolates). S. epidermidis isolates carried SCCmec IV, composite variant SCCmec (mecB+, ccr1,+ccr2) or unusual patterns with two mec gene complexes (class A and class B). Among S. haemolyticus isolates 9 St were recovered. Isolates carried modified SCCmec type IV (ccr2+, comlex mec class B 1kbp), or elements SCCmecV (ccr5+). SCCmec in 42.7{\%} isolates were not typable. The predominant SCCmec type found among S. hominis isolates was a new type with ccr1 and class mec typeA. Conclusion: Only 4 species (S. epidermidis, S haemolyticus, S. hominis, S. warneri were prevalent (98.8{\%}) among tested collection of coagulasenegative staphylococci.

The emerging New Delhi metallo-$\beta$-lactamase (NDM), an acquired class B carbapenemase has gain public attention due to its extended hydrolysis of $\beta$-lactams including carbapenems. Objective: We report the first isolates of this emerging resistance mechanism in our hospitals in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Methods: Between September and October 2013, four carbapenem-resistant strains, three Enterobacter cloacae and one Providencia rettgeri were isolated in our clinical Microbiology Lab from distinct patients hospitalized at different hospitals located at two distinct cities of Rio de Janeiro. MIC was determined by CLSI broth microdilution method. Specific primers were used for PCR detection of blaNDM, blaKPC, blaGES, blaSPM, blaGIM, blaSIM, blaCTX-M, blaSHV, blaTEM, blaOXA-48, armA, rmtA, rmtB, rmtC, rmtD, rmtG, npmA followed by DNA sequencing. Clonal relatedness among E. cloacae isolates was examined by PFGE. Plasmid extraction was performed by Kieser protocol. Conjugation with E. coli J53 (LacZ- Nalr Rifr) and hybridization with specific probes were used to determine transfer of carbapenem resistance. The species identification was confirmed by MALDI-ToF MS{\textregistered} and 16sRNA DNA sequencing. Results: Of the four isolates, three were from public hospital and one from a private hospital. Enterobacter cloacae were isolated in blood, ascitic fluid and rectal swab and one Providencia rettgeri was isolated in urine. All strains showed higher resistant rates to carbapenems and to broad-spectrum cephalosporins and P. rettgeri was resistant to polymyxin B, as expected. blaNDM-1 and blaTEM-1 were identified in all isolates. All E. cloacae also produced blaCTX-M-15, and showed different PFGE pattern. blaKPC-2 was identified in one E. cloacae isolate (isolate E134) and armA gene was detected in E. cloacae gentamicin and amikacin resistant (isolate E133). Conjugation of blaNDM-1 was achieved in 2/4 isolates, E. cloacae (isolate E134) and P. rettgeri (isolate E132). The hybridization revealed that blaKPC-2 was located in the E. cloacae chromosome. The genetic location of blaNDM-1 is being confirmed among the isolates evaluated. Conclusion: Those isolates in Rio de Janeiro, showed the importance of correct molecular study of isolates that express carbapenenem resistance in the clinical Microbiology Lab, as, although the blaNDM-1 has been previously reported in Enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates in our country, this study constitutes the first one that identified the co-association of blaNDM-1 and blaKPC-2 in E. cloacae.

Here we describe a NDM-1 case in the Netherlands, imported from the Balkan area, and a secondary case in the same hospital. Materials and methods: The study was performed as part of a retrospective analysis on a collection of 485 Enterobacteriaceae isolates, from patients in the east of the Netherlands. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing and species identification were performed by the VITEC 2. Cabapenems MIC values were determined by the E-test. Phenotypic ESBL confirmation was performed by a combination disc diffusion. For phenotypic confirmation of carbapenemase production, the modified Hodge test (MHT) and two inhibitor-based tests: ertapenem-boronic acid and imipenem-EDTA, were used. A microarray was used for genotypic characterisation of ESBL's and carbapenemases. Characterisation of NDM-gene and plasmid analysis, were done using PCR, sequencing and cloning. Genetic relatedness is tested by Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP). For genotyping the Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was used. Results: Two ESBL producing K. pneumoniae strains from two patients were selected for further analysis by their elevated MIC's to meropenem. One patient was transferred from a hospital in Belgrado, Bosnia, to hospital in the east of the Netherlands on the 27th of August 2008 and directly placed in a separate room in isolation because of MRSA carriage. The second patient, with no travel history outside the Netherlands, was admitted to the same hospital between the 10th of October and the 7th of November 2008. The results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing and phenotypic confirmations are shown in Table 1. Molecular gene analysis revealed NDM-1, CTX-M-15, SHV-12, TEM-1, and OXA-1. Molecular plasmid analysis revealed the presence of a 70 kb, Inc II plasmid containing the bla NDM-1, and a 140 kb plasmid in both isolates. AFLP showed that both strains were identical. MLST analysis showed that both isolates belong to ST15. (Table Presented) Conclusions: This first encountered NDM-1 producing K. pneumoniae in the Netherlands underlines further that Balkan states constitute a secondary reservoir for NDM-1 producers.

We used REP-PCR and MLST to analyse Genotyping and homology. We detected blaOXA-51, blaOXA-23, blaOXA-24, blaOXA-58 and blaNDM-1 by PCR. All the drug-susceptibility test results and patients' clinical datas were also collected at the same time. Results All of the 138 Acinetobacter baumannii strains were divided into 6 gene types by REP-PCR, the mayor type was type A. MLST divided the A1 subtype of the type A into 8 distinct sequence types, the main sequence types was ST191,we also discovered the ST381 for the first time in China. The Carbapenemases gene-positive Acinetobacter baumannii widely distributed, all the 138 strains contained OXA-51 but were negative for OXA-24, OXA-58 and NDM-1 gene, 80.43{\%} isolates were positive for OXA-23 gene. Compared Clone A with B, their positive rates of OXA-23 gene were statistal different P {\textless} 0.01, as the same as Clone A and C. The differences of MDR rate and PDR rate between different Clones were not statistically significant P {\textgreater} 0.05. Conclusion The mayor type Acinetobacter baumannii of ICU in Hunan province was type A; and was the ST191 of MLST. The Carbapenemases genepositive Acinetobacter baumannii widely distributed, carry the OXA-51 gene and OXA-23 gene was an important reason for antibiotic resistant phenomenon of Acinetobacter baumannii of ICU in Hunan province.",H Tan and M Li and P Pan and Z Wang and C Hu,1323-7799,Respirology,"Acinetobacter baumannii,Asian,China,antibiotic agent,antibiotic resistance,carbapenemase,clone,drug sensitivity,gene,genotype,hospital,hospitalization,human,intensive care unit,molecular epidemiology,patient,secretion (process),society",102,{The molecular epidemiology and and antibiotic resistance of acinetobacter baumannii isolated from intensive care unit in hunan province},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L71371699 http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/resp.12184 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=13237799{\&}id=doi:10.1111{\%}2Fresp.12184{\&}atitle=The+molecular+epidemiology+an,18,2013,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,MAYBE,Melanie,NO,Erica,Allison,Mushtaq,no,cant access,19883,MAYBE,Stavrum2009,Article,"BACKGROUND: India has the highest estimated burden of tuberculosis in the world, accounting for 21{\%} of all tuberculosis cases world-wide. However, due to lack of systematic analysis using multiple markers the available information on the genomic diversity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in India is limited. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Thus, 65 M. tuberculosis isolates from New Delhi, India were analyzed by spoligotyping, MIRU-VNTR, large deletion PCR typing and single nucleotide polymorphism analysis (SNP). The Central Asian (CAS) 1 {\_}DELHI sub-lineage was the most prevalent sub-lineage comprising 46.2{\%} (n = 30) of all isolates, with shared-type (ST) 26 being the most dominant genotype comprising 24.6{\%} (n = 16) of all isolates. Other sub-lineages observed were: East-African Indian (EAI)-5 (9.2{\%}, n = 6), EAI6{\_}BGD1 (6.2{\%}, n = 4), EAI3{\_}IND, CAS and T1 with 6.2{\%} each (n = 4 each), Beijing (4.6{\%}, n = 3), CAS2 (3.1{\%}, n = 2), and X1 and X2 with 1 isolate each. Genotyping results from five isolates (7.7{\%}) did not match any existing spoligopatterns, and one isolate, ST124, belonged to an undefined lineage. Twenty-six percent of the isolates belonged to the TbD1+ PGG1 genogroup. SNP analysis of the pncA gene revealed a CAS-lineage specific silent mutation, S65S, which was observed for all CAS-lineage isolates (except two ST26 isolates) and in 1 orphan. Mutations in the pncA gene, conferring resistance to pyrazinamide, were observed in 15.4{\%} of all isolates. Collectively, mutations in the rpoB gene, the katG gene and in both rpoB and katG genes, conferring resistance to rifampicin and isoniazid, respectively, were more frequent in CAS1{\_}DELHI isolates compared to non-CAS{\_}DELHI isolates (OR: 3.1, CI95{\%} [1.11, 8.70], P = 0.045). The increased frequency of drug-resistance could not be linked to the patients' history of previous anti-tuberculosis treatment (OR: 1.156, CI95{\%} [0.40, 3.36], P = 0.79). Fifty-six percent of all new tuberculosis patients had mutations in either the katG gene or the rpoB gene, or in both katG and rpoB genes. CONCLUSION: CAS1{\_}DELHI isolates circulating in New Delhi, India have a high frequency of mutations in the rpoB and katG genes. A silent mutation (S65S) in the pncA gene can be used as a putative genetic marker for CAS-lineage isolates.",R Stavrum and V P Myneedu and V K Arora and N Ahmed and H M Grewal,1932-6203,PLoS ONE,"Bacterial Typing Techniques,Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial/*genetics,Genes, Bacterial/drug effects/genetics,Humans,India,Mutation,Mycobacterium tuberculosis/genetics/*isolation {\&} p,Polymerase Chain Reaction,Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide,Pyrazinamide,Tuberculosis/epidemiology/microbiology",e4540,{In-depth molecular characterization of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from New Delhi--predominance of drug resistant isolates of the 'modern' (TbD1) type},NA,4,2009,2,"1932-6203Stavrum, RuthMyneedu, Vithal PrasadArora, Virendra KAhmed, NiyazGrewal, Harleen M SJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tUnited StatesPLoS One. 2009;4(2):e4540. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0004540.

In enterococci, cfr has been described only in an animal isolate of Enterococcus faecalis from China, but isolates from human origin have not been characterized. Here, we report an isolate of linezolid-resistant E. faecalis (603- 50427X) recovered from a patient in Thailand who received prolonged therapy with the antibiotic for the treatment of atypical mycobacterial disease. Methods: Linezolid MIC of the E. faecalis 603-50427X was confirmed by Etest and the Sequence type (ST) was determined by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). The presence of mutations in genes encoding all copies of the 23S rRNA and ribosomal proteins L3 and L4 were investigated by PCR and sequencing. Detection of the presence of the cfr gene was performed by PCR and the entire gene was sequenced. In order to determine plasmid localization of cfr; S1 digestion, PFGE and Southern hybridization with a cfr probe within the genome of E. faecalis 603-50427X, were performed. The DNA sequence upstream and downstream of cfr was obtained using inverse PCR methodology and sequencing. Conjugative transfer of cfr was conducted by filter mating using E. faecalis 603-50427X as donor and E. faecalis OG1RF, Enterococcus faecium GE1 and Staphylococcus aureus RN4220-RF as recipients. Results: The isolate lacked mutations in the genes coding for 23S rRNA, L3 and L4 ribosomal proteins and belonged to the ST16. Resistance to linezolid was associated to the presence of cfr on a ∼97- kb transferable plasmid. The cfr gene environment exhibited DNA sequences similar (nucleotide identity 99-100{\%}) to other cfr plasmid associated regions previously described in staphylococci. The cfr gene was flanked upstream and downstream by IS256-like sequences and was carried on a plasmid that was transferable by conjugation to a laboratory strain of E. faecalis (OG1RF) (efficiency of 2.6 × 10-5 transconjugants per donor) but not to E. faecalis or S. aureus.

Transmission of blaKPC, the plasmid-borne KPC gene, can be mediated by clonal spread and horizontal transfer. Here, we report the complete nucleotide sequences of two novel blaKPC-3-harboring IncFIA plasmids, pBK30661 and pBK30683. pBK30661 is 74 kb in length, with a mosaic plasmid structure; it exhibits homologies to several other plasmids but lacks the plasmid transfer operon (tra) and the origin of transfer (oriT) that are required for plasmid transfer. pBK30683 is a conjugative plasmid with a cointegrated plasmid structure, comprising a 72-kb element that highly resembles pBK30661 ({\textgreater}99.9{\%} nucleotide identities) and an extra 68-kb element that harbors tra and oriT. A PCR scheme was designed to detect the distribution of blaKPC-harboring IncFIA (pBK30661-like and pBK30683-like) plasmids in a collection of clinical Enterobacteriaceae isolates from 10 hospitals in New Jersey and New York. KPC-harboring IncFIA plasmids were found in 20{\%} of 491 K. pneumoniae isolates, and all carried blaKPC-3. pBK30661-like plasmids were identified mainly in the epidemic sequence type 258 (ST258) K. pneumoniae clone, while pBK30683-like plasmids were widely distributed in ST258 and other K. pneumoniae sequence types and among non-K. pneumoniae Enterobacteriaceae species. This suggests that both clonal spread and horizontal plasmid transfer contributed to the dissemination of blaKPC-harboring IncFIA plasmids in our area. Further studies are needed to understand the distribution of this plasmid group in other health care regions and to decipher the origins of pBK30661-like and pBK30683-like plasmids.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Records of six patients with S. maltophilia endophthalmitis between January 1, 1998, and December 31, 2007, were reviewed. RESULTS: Clinical settings included post-trauma (2 eyes), post-cataract extraction (2 eyes), post-keratoplasty with keratitis (1 eye), and post-vitreous lavage (1 eye). Presenting visual acuity ranged from counting fingers to no light perception. Final visual acuity ranged from 10/20 to no light perception. Initial treatment included pars plana vitrectomy in 4 eyes and tap in 2 eyes. Most isolates were susceptible to fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or moxifloxacin) and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim; however, they were resistant to ceftazidime and aminoglycosides. CONCLUSION: S. maltophilia is an uncommon causative agent of endophthalmitis and is resistant to commonly used antibiotics, such as ceftazidime and aminoglycosides.

In this study, the characteristics of Staphylococcus aureus isolates from patients who had undergone adenoidectomy were investigated via spa typing method. Methods: A total of 113 children with adenoid hypertrophy who underwent adenoidectomy during September 2009 to November 2010, were included in the study. The isolates were identified to the species level as S. aureus using standard biochemical methods, following which the amplification and sequencing of the spa gene X region were carried out. Results: S. aureus was found in the adenoid tissue of 26 (23{\%}) patients. Out of the 26 S. aureus isolates, 5 (19{\%}), 3 (11.5{\%}) and 3 (11.5{\%}) were resistant to tetracycline, erythromycin and oxacillin respectively. All the isolates were susceptible to vancomycin, rifampin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, mupirocin and quinupristin-dalfopristin and were typed using spa typing method. All the isolates were found to include 21 spa types, including two previously unreported types (t7685 and t7692). The most prevalent spa types were t7685 (11.5{\%}), t230 (8{\%}), t325 (8{\%}) and t1149 (8{\%}). Conclusion: This study demonstrates that the prevalence rate of S. aureus in the adenoid tissue of the children assessed was 23{\%}. An interesting point to note was the dominance of the spa type t7685 that has not been previously reported by other studies. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",M Emaneini and S S Khoramrooz and M Taherikalani and F Jabalameli and M Aligholi,0165-5876,Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol,",Adenoidectomy/*methods,Adenoids/*microbiology/pathology/surgery,Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology,Bacterial,Bacterial Typing Techniques,Cohort Studies,DNA,Female,Humans,Hypertrophy/microbiology/surgery,Male,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Prevalence,Retrospective Studies,Sensitivity and Specificity,Staphylococcal Infections/*classification/drug the,Staphylococcus aureus,Staphylococcus aureus/*classification/isolation {\&},adenoid hypertrophy,adenoidectomy,adolescent,antibiotic resistance,article,bacterial gene,bacterium detection,bacterium identification,bacterium isolation,child,ciprofloxacin,controlled study,erythromycin,female,gene sequence,gentamicin,human,human tissue,hypertrophy,major clinical study,male,nonhuman,oxacillin,patient assessment,preschool child,priority journal,protein A gene,pseudomonic acid,rifampicin,school child,tetracycline,vancomycin",1446--1449,{Molecular characterization of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from children with adenoid hypertrophy: emergence of new spa types t7685 and t7692},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L51615974 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijporl.2011.08.013 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=01655876{\&}id=doi:10.1016{\%}2Fj.ijporl.2011.08.013{\&}atitle=Molecular,75,2011,11,"From Duplicate 2 (Molecular characterization of Staphylococcus aureus isolated from children with adenoid hypertrophy: emergence of new spa types t7685 and t7692 - Emaneini, M; Khoramrooz, S S; Taherikalani, M; Jabalameli, F; Aligholi, M)1872-8464Emaneini, MohammadKhoramrooz, Seyed SajjadTaherikalani, MorovatJabalameli, FereshtehAligholi, MarziehComparative StudyJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tIrelandInt J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol. 2011 Nov;75(11):1446-9. doi: 10.1016/j.ijporl.2011.08.013.

Except for Corynebacterium diphtheriae, they were once considered contaminants of mucosa. Recent publications in medical bacteriology have highlighted the importance of several species, such as C. aurimucosum. To the best of our knowledge, we report the first isolation of this strain from urine. Case presentation: We report a case of a patient with a urinary tract infection with C. aurimucosum. We isolated this bacterium from a 52-year-old man of Wolof ethniticity (an ethnic group in Senegal, West Africa) at the regional hospital of Saint Louis, Senegal. Microscopic examination of his total urine sample showed coryneform Gram-positive bacilli associated with a high leukocyte reaction. After repeated isolation of the corynebacteria in three samples from the patient's urine, it was identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The strain was susceptible to antibiotics, except for penicillin and co-trimoxazole. The potential infectious role of these commensal species in several infections should be taken into consideration. Conclusions: This case highlights the significant proportion of species in the genus Corynebacterium other than dyphteriae in the infectious process. The use of mass spectrometry for identification highlights the originality of this work and the importance of these new diagnostic tools that are unavailable in most health facilities of countries with limited resources.

Methods: All nosocomial infections due to K. pneumoniae strains with reduced susceptibility to carbapenems (MIC in meropenem: (1) were recorded in our hospital from November 2010 through November 2011, according to a National Surveillance Study for the management of multi-drug resistant Gram-negative pathogens. Of 31 clinical isolates were recovered from 25 patients in our laboratory. Susceptibility tests were performed by Kirby-Bauer method, MIC determination by automated system (Phoenix, BD) and E-test method (Biomerieux SA, France) according CLSI standards. Preliminary phenotypic detection was based on the boronic acid disk test, a simple phenotypic algorithm employing three combined-disc tests consisting of meropenem alone and with phenylboronic acid (PBA), EDTA, and both PBA and EDTA. Genotypic confirmation for the presence of the bla-KPC gene by PCR and molecular typing by PFGE. Results: Of 12 cases of bacteremia, seven catheter related infections, three surgical site infections, two lower respiratory tract infections, five ventilator-associated pneumonia and two urinary tract infections were identified. Twenty-three infections were recorded in ICU, four in Surgical and four in Internal Medicine unit respectively. Ninteen out of 25 patients were mechanically ventilated, 21 had central venous catheter and 25 urinary-bladder catheter. The crude mortality, 28 days after the first positive culture, was 32{\%}. Multidrug resistance characterized the studied isolates with an MIC range to meromenem ≤1 to (32, with colistin, gentamicin and tigecycline being the most active agents. Boronic acid disk test was able to differentiate 26 KPC, 3 MBL producers and two co-producers of both carbapenemases. PCR confirmed that all 26 isolates produce KPC- 2 b-lactamases and belong to the same dominant genotype in Greece. Conclusion: In Greek hospitals, carbapenem resistance among Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolates, is alarming and poses a unique challenge for clinical microbiologists and clinicians.

The first reports of VRE isolation were from hemodialysis patients. However, to date, VRE fecal colonization rates as well as associated risk factors in kidney transplant patients have not yet been established in prospective studies. Methods: We collected one or two stool samples from 280 kidney transplant patients and analysed the prevalence of VRE and its associated risk factors. Patients were evaluated according to the post-transplant period: group 1, less than 30 days after transplantation (102 patients), group 2, one to 6 months after transplantation (73 patients) and group 3, more than 6 months after transplantation (105 patients). Results: The overall prevalence nate of fecal VRE colonization was 13.6{\%} (38/280), respectively 13.7{\%} for Group 1, 15.1{\%} for group 2 and 12.4{\%} for group 3. E. faecium and E faecalis comprised 50{\%} of all VRE isolates. No immunologic variables were clearly correlated with VRE colonization and no infections related to VRE colonization were reported. Conclusion: Fecal VRE colonization rates in kidney transplant patients were as high as those reported for other high-risk groups, such as critical care and hemodialysis patients.

With the emergence of drug-resistant GC in the past 40 years, treatment options have become very limited. Hence, the U.S. Department of Defense has launched a GC resistance surveillance network in 8 countries; preliminary results are reported from the United States, Djibouti, Ghana, Kenya, and Peru. Methods: Patients with urethritis, cervicitis or vaginitis symptoms were recruited at participating clinics serving military personnel and beneficiaries, civilians, and at-risk groups of men who have sex with men and female commercial sex workers. Urethral swabs were collected from men; urethral or vaginal swabs from women; diagnosis was done using culture identification, nucleic acid amplification testing, and real-time PCR. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) was conducted on GC positive isolates using real-time PCR, disc diffusion, and E-test strip methods. Results: Overall, 108 (6{\%}) of 1,694 enrolled subjects tested positive for GC. Prevalence was found to be highest in Kenya where 33 (38{\%}) of 86 patients were positive and was lowest in Peru where only 30 (2{\%}) of 1,296 patients were positive. AST results were available on 66 GC positives; resistance to at least three antibiotics was observed across all overseas sites. Greatest variability in resistance was noted in Djibouti as follows: penicillin (100{\%}), tetracycline (88{\%}), ciprofloxacin (38{\%}), levofloxacin (17{\%}), cefepime (13{\%}), and ceftriaxone (13{\%}). High-level resistance (100{\%}) was also noted in Ghana to ciprofloxacin, penicillin, and tetracycline. Conclusion: These findings provide evidence of emerging drug-resistant GC in several regions of the world; the resistance found against third-generation cephalosporin in Djibouti is especially noteworthy.

Treatment was based on the World Health Organization guidelines, with the inclusion of a new proposal for the use of a combination of antituberculosis drugs (imipenem and linezolid). In the cases studied, we show the challenge of creating an acceptable, effective treatment regimen including drugs that are more toxic, are more expensive, and are administered for longer periods.

METHODS: We screened two patient groups: an 'admission group' recruited within 48 h of admission; and an 'inpatient group' recruited five or more days after admission. S. aureus isolates were characterized by antibiotic susceptibility testing and genotyped by a multi-locus sequence type-based high-resolution melting scheme. FINDINGS: S. aureus carriage on admission was 30.7{\%} of 225 compared with 34.8{\%} among 201 inpatients, with MRSA carriage of 2.2{\%} and 18.9{\%} respectively.

Yet, the rise of extensively resistant strains paints a picture of a microbe with an impressive adaptive potential. Here we describe the first documented case of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis evolved from a susceptible ancestor within a single patient. RESULTS: Genome sequences of nine serial M. tuberculosis isolates from the same patient uncovered a dramatic turnover of competing lineages driven by the emergence, and subsequent fixation or loss of single nucleotide polymorphisms. For most drugs, resistance arose through independent emergence of mutations in more than one clone, of which only one ultimately prevailed as the clone carrying it expanded, displacing the other clones in the process. The vast majority of mutations identified over 3.5 years were either involved in drug resistance or hitchhiking in the genetic background of these. Additionally, RNA-sequencing of isolates grown in the absence of drug challenge revealed that the efflux-associated iniBAC operon was up-regulated over time, whereas down-regulated genes include those involved in mycolic acid synthesis. CONCLUSIONS: We observed both rapid acquisitions of resistance to antimicrobial compounds mediated by individual mutations as well as a gradual increase in fitness in the presence of antibiotics, likely driven by stable gene expression reprogramming. The rapid turnover of resistance mutations and hitchhiking neutral mutations has major implications for inferring tuberculosis transmission events in situations where drug resistance evolves within transmission chains.",V Eldholm and G Norheim and B {von der Lippe} and W Kinander and U R Dahle and D A Caugant and T Manns\aaker and A T Mengshoel and A M Dyrhol-Riise and F Balloux and T Mannsaker and A T Mengshoel and A M Dyrhol-Riise and F Balloux,1474-7596,Genome Biol,",*Evolution,*High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing,Anti-Infective Agents/therapeutic use,Bacterial,Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis/*genetics/,Genome,Humans,Molecular,Mutation,Mycobacterium tuberculosis,Mycobacterium tuberculosis/*genetics/pathogenicity,Phylogeny,Polymorphism,Single Nucleotide,antiinfective agent,bacterial genome,extensively drug resistant tuberculosis,genetics,high throughput sequencing,human,microbiology,molecular evolution,mutation,pathogenicity,phylogeny,single nucleotide polymorphism",490,{Evolution of extensively drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis from a susceptible ancestor in a single patient},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L609751860 http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13059-014-0490-3 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=1474760X{\&}id=doi:10.1186{\%}2Fs13059-014-0490-3{\&}atitle=Evolution+of+e,15,2014,11,"From Duplicate 1 (Evolution of extensively drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis from a susceptible ancestor in a single patient - Eldholm, V; Norheim, G; von der Lippe, B; Kinander, W; Dahle, U R; Caugant, D A; Mannsaker, T; Mengshoel, A T; Dyrhol-Riise, A M; Balloux, F)1474-760xEldholm, VegardNorheim, Gunnsteinvon der Lippe, BentKinander, WibekeDahle, Ulf RCaugant, Dominique AMannsaker, TuridMengshoel, Anne TorunnDyrhol-Riise, Anne MaBalloux, FrancoisJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tEnglandGenome Biol. 2014 Nov 7;15(11):490. doi: 10.1186/s13059-014-0490-3.",10.1186/s13059-014-0490-3,11/25/14,eng,25418686,MAYBE,Jake,YES,Zach,Zach,Mushtaq,Downloaded,,3797,YES,Chironna2016,Article,"Macrolide-resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MR-MP) is an increasing problem worldwide. This study describes the clonal spread of a unique strain of MR-MP within a single family. On January 23, 2015, nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum samples were collected from the index case (a 9-year-old girl) in southern Italy. The patient had pneumonia and was initially treated with clarithromycin. MR-MP infection was suspected due to prolonged symptoms despite appropriate antibiotic therapy. Two further cases of pneumonia occurred in relatives (a 7-year-old cousin and the 36-year-old mother of the index case); therefore, respiratory samples were also collected from other family members. Sequence analysis identified mutations associated with resistance to macrolides. Both P1 major adhesion protein typing and multiple loci variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) typing were performed to assess the relatedness of the strains. The index case, the cousin, the mother, and another 4 family members (twin siblings of the index case, a 3-year-old cousin, and the grandmother) were positive for MR-MP. All strains harbored the mutation A2063G, had the same P1 subtype (1), and were MLVA (7/4/ 5/7/2) type Z. In addition, the index case's aunt (31 years of age and the probable source of infection) harbored an M pneumoniae strain with the same molecular profile; however, this strain was susceptible to macrolides.

This hospital performed specific medical examinations for foreign patients. All patients were hospitalized 1-7 months before NDM-1 was isolated without history of overseas travel or medication. All the NDM-1-producing isolates were resistant to imipenem, meropenem, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, amikacin, ceftazidime, and cefotaxime, but were susceptible to colistin and tigecycline. TEM, SHV, CTX-M-15, DHA-1, OXA-1 genes were detected. PFGE analysis showed 98{\%} similarity, indicating clonality. All isolates belonged to phylogenetic group B1, ST101, which is a rare sequence type in Korea. Conclusion: This is the first case of NDM-1-producing E. coli in Korea. All isolates were identified from the four patients sharing the room. The transmission route of the organism was determined to be personal contact among the patients in the hospital, although the origin was not clear. However, E. coli B1-ST101 was reported as the major international clone of NDM-1-producing E. coli from England, Pakistan, Canada, Australia, and after considering the patients' epidemiological data, it was suspected that this organism was imported. Thus, continuous surveillance and hospital infection control would be important to prevent the spread of this organism.",J S Yoo and H M Kim and H S Koo and J W Yang and H S Chung and H K Park and G T Chung and Y S Lee,1198-743X,Clinical Microbiology and Infection,"Australia,Canada,Enterobacteriaceae,Escherichia coli,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Korea,Pakistan,South Korea,United Kingdom,amikacin,antibiotic sensitivity,carbapenemase,cefotaxime,ceftazidime,ciprofloxacin,clonal variation,clone,colistin,drug therapy,epidemiological data,feces culture,gene,genotype,gentamicin,hospital,hospital infection,hospital patient,human,imipenem,infection,infection control,inosine phosphate,medical examination,meropenem,metallo beta lactamase,microbiology,organisms,patient,tigecycline,travel,urine culture,ward",710,{First isolation of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1-producing Escherichia coli ST101-B1 in South Korea},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L70824125 http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-0691.2012.03802.x http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=1198743X{\&}id=doi:10.1111{\%}2Fj.1469-0691.2012.03802.x{\&}atitle=F,18,2012,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,YES,Jake,YES,Ayomide,Ayomide,Mushtaq,Downloaded,,20371,YES,Taj-Aldeen2013,Article,"Background: Nocardia species are rare, opportunistic organisms that cause disease in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals. Objective: To investigate the clinical presentations of various Nocardia infections based on the 16S ribosomal RNA gene of the isolate, as well as related risk factors and susceptibility patterns to antimicrobial agents Methods: Thirteen patients with a diagnosis of nocardiosis were included in the present study. Seven Nocardia species were identified by 16S ribosomal RNA. Susceptibility testing was performed using six antimicrobial agents. Results: Five patients were immunocompromised, and eight were immunocompetent with predisposing factors including cystic fibrosis, tuberculosis and ophthalmic infections. Nocardia caused pulmonary infections in eight patients (61.5{\%}), invasive systemic infections in three patients (23{\%}) and local (ophthalmic) infections in two patients (15.4{\%}). In the patients with pulmonary disease, nocardiosis was caused by six species (Nocardia cyriacigeorgica, Nocardia otitidiscaviarum, Nocardia farcinica, Nocardia carnea, Nocardia testacea and Nocardia asiatica). The seventh species identified in the present study was Nocardia crassostreae. Discussion: N crassostreae is a multidrug-resistant organism that was reported to be an emerging human pathogen causing invasive nocardiosis in a patient with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. N farcinica was isolated from blood in a patient with breast cancer. None of the Nocardia isolates were resistant to linezolid. One N otitidiscaviarum isolate was a multidrug-resistant organism. All patients in the present study were treated with the appropriate antibiotics and their condition resolved without further sequelae. Conclusions: The present study is the first report on N crassostreae as a human pathogen. The detection of multidrug-resistant species necessitate molecular identification and susceptibility testing, and should be performed for all Nocardia infections.

The purpose of this article is to review novel ARB, which have emerged in this patient population, their mechanisms of transmission, and preventive efforts aimed at limiting their dissemination. RECENT FINDINGS: New strains of ARB, including community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus, S. aureus strains with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin, vancomycin-resistant S. aureus and multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (MDRGN), are emerging among the CHD population. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase Gram-negative bacteria (ESBLGN) are among the most common MDRGN strains. These ESBLGN are resistant to the great majority of antimicrobials. The carbapenems remain the only optimal antimicrobial choice to treat ESBLGN infections. Intrafacility spread of ARB in dialysis units occurs between patients through contaminated hands and clothes of healthcare workers (HCWs), as well as contaminated inanimate surfaces. Spread of ARB to family members of both patients and HCWs has also been documented. SUMMARY: Colonization and infection with ARB continues to present a significant threat to patients receiving CHD. Interventions to reduce the spread of ARB should include infection control measures and judicious use of antimicrobials.",G M Snyder and E M C D'Agata,"1473-65431062-4821",Curr Opin Nephrol Hypertens,",*Drug Resistance,*Enterococcus,*Gram-Negative Bacteria,*Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus,Bacterial,Cross Infection/prevention {\&} control,Gram negative bacterium,Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient,Humans,Multiple,Peptoclostridium difficile,Renal Dialysis/*adverse effects,Vancomycin Resistance,antibiotic resistance,bacterial colonization,bacterial infection,bacterial strain,beta lactamase,beta-Lactam Resistance,bloodstream infection,ceftazidime,chlorhexidine,ciprofloxacin,cohort analysis,diarrhea,disease surveillance,drug resistance,gene transfer,gentamicin,health care,health care personnel,hemodialysis,human,infection control,meropenem,methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus,minimum inhibitory concentration,nephrotoxicity,neurotoxicity,outpatient department,patient care,patient compliance,personal hygiene,piperacillin plus tazobactam,polymyxin,priority journal,pseudomonic acid,review,rifampicin,skin infection,soft tissue infection,sultamicillin,vancomycin,vancomycin resistant Enterococcus",211--215,{Novel antimicrobial-resistant bacteria among patients requiring chronic hemodialysis},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L51811644 http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MNH.0b013e328350089b http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=14736543{\&}id=doi:10.1097{\%}2FMNH.0b013e328350089b{\&}atitle=Novel+ant,21,2012,2,"From Duplicate 2 (Novel antimicrobial-resistant bacteria among patients requiring chronic hemodialysis - Snyder, G M; D'Agata, E M)1473-6543Snyder, Graham MD'Agata, Erika M CJournal ArticleReviewEnglandCurr Opin Nephrol Hypertens. 2012 Mar;21(2):211-5. doi: 10.1097/MNH.0b013e328350089b.",10.1097/MNH.0b013e328350089b,1/14/12,eng,22240441,YES,Erica,NO,Zach,Brooke,Mushtaq,no,no access,23039,YES,Ye2010,Article,"Aeromonas species rarely cause pulmonary infection. We report, for what is believed to be the first time, a case of severe pneumonia in a cancer patient caused by Aeromonas caviae. Detailed microbiological investigation revealed that this isolate carried three $\beta$-lactamase-encoding genes (encoding MOX-4, CTX-M-3 and TEM-1) conferring resistance to all $\beta$-lactams but imipenem. The $\beta$-lactamase with a pI of 9.0 was transferred by conjugation and associated with a 7.3 kb plasmid, as demonstrated by Southern blot hybridization. Analysis of the nucleotide and amino acid sequences showed a new ampC gene that was closely related to those encoding the MOX-1, MOX-2 and MOX-3 $\beta$-lactamases. This new plasmid-mediated AmpC $\beta$-lactamase from China was named MOX-4.
