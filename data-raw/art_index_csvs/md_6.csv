3518,MAYBE,Chatterjee2016,Article,"Background: Acinetobacter species are a heterogeneous group of organisms that have emerged as significant nosocomial pathogens affecting patients with impaired host defenses. Newborns, particularly are very prone to hospital acquired infections. Till date, A. baumannii has been predominantly implicated in neonatal sepsis but ‰ÛÏother species‰Ûù within the genus have been reported rarely. The persistence of endemic Acinetobacter strains in hospitals seems to be related to their widespread resistance to antimicrobial agents. Since carbapenems are last resort antibiotics, this study evaluated the dissemination of carbapenem-resistant genes in cases of neonatal septicemia. Methods {\&} Materials: Acinetobacter spp. from blood of septicemic neonates was identified by ARDRA and susceptibility tests were carried out by VITEK 2 system. Extended-spectrum $\beta$- lactamases, AmpCs, oxacillinases and metallo-$\beta$-lactamases were detected phenotypically and genotypically and were subsequently sequenced. Pulso-typing and plasmid characterization were also carried out. Results: A. baumannii was found to be predominant genospecies (72{\%}) followed by A. calcoaceticus, A. lwoffii, 13TU, A. junni, 15TU, A. haemolyticus and 14TU over the 7 years period. Fifty four percent of the total isolates were meropenem-resistant. Comparative analysis of susceptibility tests revealed that carbapenem resistance (meropenem, imipenem) and aminoglycoside resistance (amikacin, gentamicin) was significantly lower in other species of Acinetobacter against ACB (A. calcoaceticus-baumannii) complex. The most prevalent oxacillinases were OXA-51-like (74{\%}), OXA-23-like (50{\%}) and OXA-58-like (15{\%}). New Delhi metallo- $\beta$-lactamase-1 was the dominant MBL (22{\%}). NDM-1-harbouring isolates also possessed blaVIM-2, blaPER-1, blaVEB-2, blaCTX-M-15, armA, aac(6')Ib, aac(6')Ib-cr gene in various combinations. These isolates were clonally diverse (Figure 1) and harboured plasmids of different sizes. Conclusion: This study documents the emergence of Acinetobacter spp. in the nosocomial environment and also the significance of different genospecies of Acinetobacter causing neonatal sepsis over an extended period of time. A unique assessment of the diverse genetic determinants for carbapenem resistance was noted. The emergence of NDM-1 among an already existing repertoire of oxacillinases is a challenge for clinicians and microbiologists alike. As new resistance mechanisms constantly evolve both laboratory detection systems and infection control measures need to be enhanced.

7761,YES,Grisold2011,Article,"Objectives: Extended-spectrum $\beta$-lactamase-producing (ESBL) Enterobacteriaceae have emerged as major public health problem throughout the world, in particular India and Pakistan. We report the emergence of the newly described resistance mechanism conferred by New Delhi metallo-$\beta$-lactamase 1 (NDM-1) in Austria. NDM-1 positive Enterobacteriaceae (2x Klebsiella pneumoniae and 1x E. coli) has been detected in three patients at the University Hospital of Graz, Austria, with all three cases occurring within the last 6 months. Methods: NDM-1 shares very little identity with other metallob- lactamase (MBL) enzymes and Enterobacteriaceae with NDM-1 show high resistance to nearly all commonly used antibiotics. Primers for PCR detection of NDM-1 were designed based on GenBank (National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) database entry AB571289.1 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/300422615). Results: NDM-1 was detected in isolates of three patients, in two cases in K. pneumoniae, and one patient with NDM-1 positive E. coli. All threecases occurred between December 2009 and August 2010. Patient one (NDM-1 K. pneumoniae), a 30-year-old Austrian male was admitted to our University Hospital in November 2009. History revealed that he had suffered multiple open fractures of his upper and lower left leg and rectal laceration due to a motorcycle accident in Pakistan. In patient two the NDM-1 K. pneumoniae was detected in August 2010, the patient being a 14-year-old Kosovarian boy transferred from Kosovo to the Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Graz, with multiple intraabdominal abscess formations and peritonitis. He had undergone appendectomy in Pristina, Kosovo, in April 2010 and had developed abdominal sepsis consecutively. Patient number three (NDM-1 E. coli), a 56 year old male developed a necrotizing fasciitis when being in India in January 2010, after a short admittance at a hospital in New Delhi the patient was transferred to Austria. Conclusion: Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae with the newly described resistance enzyme NDM-1 have been recently shown to pose the potential of growing to a major public health problem worldwide. We report the emergence of NDM-1 among Enterobacteriaceae in Austria.

3025,MAYBE,Candido2014,Article,"Worldwide, nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) have become emergent pathogens of pulmonary infections in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, with an estimated prevalence ranging from 5 to 20{\%}. This work investigated the presence of NTM in sputum samples of 129 CF patients (2 to 18 years old) submitted to longitudinal clinical supervision at a regional reference center in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. From June 2009 to March 2012, 36 NTM isolates recovered from 10 (7.75{\%}) out of 129 children were obtained. Molecular identification of NTM was performed by using PCR restriction analysis targeting the hsp65 gene (PRA-hsp65) and sequencing of the rpoB gene, and susceptibility tests were performed that followed Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute recommendations. For evaluating the genotypic diversity, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and/or enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequence PCR (ERIC-PCR) was performed. The species identified were Mycobacterium abscessus subsp. bolletii (n = 24), M. abscessus subsp. abscessus (n = 6), Mycobacterium fortuitum (n = 3), Mycobacterium marseillense (n = 2), and Mycobacterium timonense (n = 1). Most of the isolates presented resistance to five or more of the antimicrobials tested. Typing profiles were mainly patient specific. The PFGE profiles indicated the presence of two clonal groups for M. abscessus subsp. abscessus and five clonal groups for M. abscesssus subsp. bolletii, with just one clone detected in two patients.

Melioidosis is caused by the saprophytic Gram negative bacteria Burkholderia pseudomallei. Most disease occurs in residents of Southeast-Asia and North-Australia. The most common presentation of Melioidosis is pneumonia but as these cases demonstrate the infection has protean manifestations and B. pseudomallei can infect nearly every organ. It is important to notify the laboratory of the possibilty of Melioidosis as the bacteria can be difficult to identify and poses an infection risk to laboratory staff. Also, B. pseudomallei is resistant to many of the antibiotics normally used to treat pneumonia and due to its intracellular persistance requires prolonged therapy.",T Gudmundsdottir and H Asgeirsson and H S Hardarson and A S Thorisdottir,"0023-7213 (Print)0023-7213",Laeknabladid,"*Melioidosis/diagnosis/drug therapy/microbiology/t,Adult,Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use,Bacteriological Techniques,Burkholderia pseudomallei/*isolation {\&} purificatio,Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial,Humans,Iceland,Middle Aged,Predictive Value of Tests,Treatment Outcome,Young Adult",85--89,"{[Melioidosis, first four cases in Iceland]}",NA,100,2014,2,"Gudmundsdottir, ThorgerdurAsgeirsson, HilmirHardarson, Hordur SnaevarThorisdottir, Anna SesseljaCase ReportsEnglish AbstractJournal ArticleReviewIcelandLaeknabladid. 2014 Feb;100(2):85-9.",NA,3/19/14,ice,24639431,YES,Cale,NO,Erica,Zach,Mushtaq,no
