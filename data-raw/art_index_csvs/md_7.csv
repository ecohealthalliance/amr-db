20588,MAYBE,Tato2007,Article,"BACKGROUND: We report the emergence and spread of metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs) among enterobacterial isolates at Ramon y Cajal University Hospital (Madrid, Spain). METHODS AND RESULTS: During the period from March 2005 through September 2006, 25 patients (52{\%} of whom were in the intensive care unit) were infected and/or colonized with single or different MBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates (Klebsiella pneumoniae, 14 patients; Enterobacter cloacae, 12 patients; Escherichia coli, 1 patient; and/or Klebsiella oxytoca, 1 patient). Clonal analysis (XbaI pulsed-field gel electrophoresis) revealed that all K. pneumoniae isolates belonged to the same clone, but 6 patterns were found among the E. cloacae isolates. Carbapenems were affected to different degrees (minimum inhibitory concentration, {\textless} or = 1 to {\textgreater} 8 microg/mL), as were aminoglycosides and ciprofloxacin. The bla(VIM-1) MBL gene was present in all isolates; in addition, the bla(SHV-12) extended-spectrum beta-lactamase gene was detected in K. pneumoniae and E. coli isolates. The bla(VIM-1) gene was detected within a 4.0-kb class 1 integron (bla(VIM-1)-aacA4-dfrII-aadA1-catB2) in K. pneumoniae and E. coli and in a 2.5-kb class 1 integron (bla(VIM-1)-aacA4-aadA1) in E. cloacae and K. oxytoca isolates. The bla(VIM-1) gene was transferable (filter-mating) in 14 of 14 K. pneumoniae isolates, 4 of 11 E. cloacae isolates, and 1 of 1 E. coli isolate. A 60-kb plasmid belonging to the IncI1 group was detected in the epidemic VIM-1-K. pneumoniae clone. Plasmids of 300- or 435-kb belonging to IncH12 group were found among E. cloacae isolates. CONCLUSIONS: K. pneumoniae-MBL monoclonal epidemics coexisted with E. cloacae-MBL multiclonal epidemics in our hospital. The spread of the bla(VIM-1) gene among Enterobacteriaceae was driven by clonal spread associated with intergeneric plasmid transfer with different class I integron platforms.

16191,MAYBE,Paulo2015,Article,"BACKGROUND-AIM Raoultella ornithinolytica was first described in 1989 by Sakazaki Et al. This bacterium is a gram-negative encapsulated aerobic bacillus belonging to family Enterobacteriaceae that is found in aquatic environments. It has the ability to convert histidine to histamine so the infection with this microorganism causes lesions of redness and flushing of the skin. There are only a few reports of human infection by R. ornithinolytica in the literature. METHODS A 33-year-old caucasian male came to our ER due to extensive edema and redness in the left hand after trauma, also presenting fever (38,6ëçC). The patient's medical history is very important because he is haemophilic, hepatitis C positive and has a drug addiction background. The CT scan showed difused edema of the subcutaneous cellular tissue without signs of fracture or necrosis. RESULTS The collection of a sample of pus, cultures and then identification with Vitek 2 System ( BioM{\'{e}}rieux, France), made possible to isolate Raoutella ornythinolytica resistant to Ampicillin and sensible to Amoxicillin + Clavulanic acid, Cefuroxime, Gentamicin and Ciprofloxacin. Flucloxacillin empirical antimicrobial therapy was then switched to amoxicilin + clavulanic acid for 13 days. After the patient presented a new episode of fever we made new cultures that provided the isolation of Enterobacter cloacae sp resistant to Ampicillin, Amoxicillin + Clavulanic acid and sensible to Cefuroxime, Gentamicin and Ciprofloxacin. There was a good clinical evolution with antibiotic treatment and local care of the lesion, and his analytical status significantly improved: white blood cell count of 7,7Õ‹10 9/L, hemoglobin of 12,6 g/dL, platelet count of 226000Õ‹10 9/L, serum sodium of 142 mEq/L, potassium of 5.3 mEq/L, urea of 40 mEq/L, and creatinine of 0,61 mg/dL.

14062,MAYBE,Mishra2013b,Article,"BACKGROUND: Infections caused by bacteria such as multidrug resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter spp. and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) constitute a worldwide pandemic. Without gathering information about these strains, we cannot reduce the morbidity and mortality due to infections caused by these notorious bugs. METHODS: This study was conducted to identify the status of MDR Acinetobacter spp. and MRSA in a tertiary care centre of Nepal. Sputum, endotracheal aspirate and bronchial washing specimens were collected and processed from patients suspected of lower respiratory tract infection following standard microbiological methods recommended by the American Society for Microbiology (ASM). Double disk synergy test method was employed for the detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) in Acinetobacter isolates. Methicillin resistance in S. aureus was confirmed by using cefoxitin and oxacillin disks. RESULTS: Different genomespecies of Acinetobacter were isolated; these consisted of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus baumannii complex and A. lwoffii. Around 95{\%} of Acinetobacter isolates were MDR, while 12.9{\%} were ESBL-producer. Of the total 33 isolates of S. aureus, 26 (78.8{\%}) were MDR and 14 (42.4{\%}) were methicillin resistant. CONCLUSIONS: A large number of MDR Acinetobacter spp. and MRSA has been noted in this study.

9323,MAYBE,Iosifidis2012,Article,"We present a polyclonal outbreak of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) colonization in a pediatric oncology department and the role of a bundle of actions. After the occurrence of VRE bloodstream infections in 2 patients, an active surveillance of VRE colonization was started. Enhanced infection control measures and closure of the department to new admissions for the first 3 months were implemented. Among 32 patients screened for VRE, 21 were found colonized. Daily prevalence of VRE colonization among hospitalized patients ranged from 40{\%} to 75{\%}, but no new VRE infections occurred. Monthly incidence of VRE colonization decreased from 2.5 to 0.6 cases per 100 occupied bed-days at the end of this outbreak by the implementation of the above-mentioned measures. All VRE isolates tested were Enterococcus faecium carrying VanA gene. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis showed a polyclonal outbreak. A case-control study did not show any particular risk factors for colonization. High use of glycopeptide was noted before study outbreak that was drastically decreased during the study but only temporarily. Control of VRE in pediatric oncology departments with high colonization rates is challenging and requires a multifaceted strategy. Polyclonal spread of VRE found in this study suggests a possible effect of prior antimicrobial overuse and the critical need for antimicrobial stewardship especially in the era of multidrug-resistant bacteria.

In India carbapenems available for use are meropenem and imipenem, introduced recently. Resistance to these has been reported in a few bacteria especially Pseudomonas spp. We therefore retrospectively evaluated the antibiotic susceptibility pattern to these agents amongst various clinical isolates in a tertiary care hospital in north India. METHODS: In this study Gram-negative bacterial pathogens isolated from clinical samples were tested for extended spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) production. All ESBL positive bacteria were tested for meropenem and imipenem activity pattern using NCCLS guidelines. A total of 2626 consecutively isolated Gram-negative bacteria, which tested positive for ESBL production by the double disk diffusion method, were included. RESULTS: The different bacteria isolated were Pseudomonas spp. 759, Acinetobacter spp. 676, Escherichia coli 569, Klebsiella spp. 343, Enterobacter spp. 150, Citrobacter spp. 57 and Proteus spp. 72. Overall resistance to meropenem was more (22.16{\%}) than imipenem (17.32{\%}). Maximum resistance was seen in Pseudomonas spp. M(R) 37.6 per cent, I(R) 30 per cent. In isolates from intensive care units (ICU) resistance to carbapenems was significantly higher than non-ICU patients.

6737,MAYBE,Fujioka2008,Article,"The information in this article was presented at the 37th Annual Meeting of the Japan Society of Burn, Nagoya, Japan, June 7-8, 2008. Alcaligenes xylosoxidans, a nonfermentative, Gram-negative rod often found in aqueous environments, has been isolated from respirators, incubators, and disinfectant solutions in the hospital environment. It is known to cause disease in immunocompromised (eg, burn) patients and represents a cross-contamination risk related to wound care. In the authors' burn unit, two patients, admitted with deep dermal burns during a 1-month time period, acquired serious A. xylosoxidans infections. The first involved A. xylosoxidans-associated cholecystitis in an adult with 32{\%} total body surface area (TBSA) burns and the second involved A. xylosoxidans meningitis in an adult with 30{\%} TBSA burns. Both patients received hydrotherapy (bathing) in the same bathing tub, one patient after the other. Culture from environmental sources isolated A. xylosoxidans from the bathing mattress. Bacterial analysis of the isolates, including antimicrobial susceptibility testing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, suggested the patients had been infected by the same strain - ie, cross-contaminated - probably during treatment of their burns. The isolated strains were resistant not only to broad-spectrum penicillins and cephalosporins, but also to imipenem, to which past A. xylosoxidans strains have been susceptible.

1874,MAYBE,Benenson2009,Article,"INTRODUCTION: Enterobacteriaceae are rarely the etiologic agents of endocarditis, with Klebsiella species being especially rare. From the end of 2005, isolates of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae began to appear in various hospitals across Israel, sensitive only to colistin and gentamicin. We present a case of hospital-acquired endocarditis caused by carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae in a young adult. CASE REPORT: An 18-year-old man with 40{\%} full thickness burns developed acute bacterial endocarditis complicated by embolic myocardial infarction. Carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae carrying the blaKPC3 gene was isolated from multiple blood cultures. He recovered fully after antibiotic treatment with colistin and gentamicin. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of acute bacterial endocarditis caused by carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae. The combination of intravenous colistin and gentamicin was effective and resulted in the cure of this patient's endocarditis without the need for surgical intervention.",S Benenson and S Navon-Venezia and Y Carmeli and A Adler and J Strahilevitz and A E Moses and C Block,1201-9712,International Journal of Infectious Diseases,",*beta-Lactam Resistance/genetics,Adolescent,Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic us,Bacterial Proteins/genetics,Bacterial/*drug therapy/microbiology,Carbapenems/*pharmacology,Colistin/*therapeutic use,Combination,Drug Therapy,Endocarditis,Gentamicins/*therapeutic use,Humans,Klebsiella Infections/drug therapy/microbiology,Klebsiella pneumoniae infection,Klebsiella pneumoniae/*drug effects/enzymology/gen,Male,ST segment elevation,Treatment Outcome,acute heart infarction,adult,amikacin,antibiotic resistance,antibiotic sensitivity,antibiotic therapy,article,bacterial endocarditis,bacterium isolate,beta-Lactamases/genetics,bla kpc3 gene,blood culture,burn,carbapenem,case report,cefepime,cephalosporin derivative,colistin,creatinine,creatinine blood level,drug withdrawal,dyspnea,fever,gene,gentamicin,heart infarction,human,kidney function,leukocyte count,male,mitral valve,piperacillin plus tazobactam,plastic surgery,quinolone derivative,thorax pain,tigecycline,troponin,wound infection",e295--8,{Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae endocarditis in a young adult.

1845,MAYBE,Belmonte2010,Article,"AIM OF THE STUDY: The antibiotic resistance of enterobacteriacae knows a worldwide worrying evolution with an increase of the extended spectrum betalactamases (ESBL) that spread into the community. Few publications describe this problem in the Indian Ocean area. The aim of this study is first to identify in Felix Guyon Hospital (Reunion Island) the emergent antibiotics resistance for enterobacteriaceae between 1997/1998 and 2006/2007 periods, at second, to update the prophylactic and therapeutic measures for handling the risk linked to multiresistant enterobacteriaceae in our hospital and third, to assess the risk in Reunion Island and especially at the community level. METHODS: The antibiotic susceptibility of 7814 enterobacteriaceae strains collected among patients, during 1997/1998 and 2006/2007 periods, were analysed as well as the consumption of the third generation cephalosporins, imipenem and fluoroquinolones. RESULTS: Within a span of time of 10 years, an important increase (+57 {\%}) of the resistance prevalence of enterobacteriaceae is observed. The resistance by the ESBL production mechanism is predominant especially for Enterobacter cloacae and Escherichia coli. An important use of broad spectrum antibiotics is correlated with this resistance evolution. CONCLUSION: The emergence of ESBL-producing enterobacteriaceae in our hospital is impairing both therapeutic and health care. It requires a much better control of antibiotics prescriptions and therefore, an important multidisciplinary implication. A proof molecular analysis would allow to evaluate the risk more precisely, especially at the community level.",O Belmonte and D Drouet and J Alba and M P Moiton and B Kuli and N Lugagne-Delpon and C Mourlan and M C Jaffar-Bandjee,0369-8114,Pathol Biol (Paris),"Bacterial Proteins/genetics/metabolism,Cephalosporin Resistance/genetics,Cephalosporinase/genetics/metabolism,Cross Infection/epidemiology/*microbiology,Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial/*genetics,Drug Utilization,Enterobacteriaceae Infections/epidemiology/*microb,Enterobacteriaceae/*drug effects/enzymology/geneti,Fluoroquinolones/pharmacology/therapeutic use,Humans,Imipenem/pharmacology/therapeutic use,Retrospective Studies,Reunion/epidemiology,Substrate Specificity,beta-Lactam Resistance/*genetics,beta-Lactamases/genetics/*isolation {\&} purification",18--24,{[Evolution of Enterobacteriaceae resistance to antibiotics in Reunion Island: emergence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases]},NA,58,2010,1,"1768-3114Belmonte, ODrouet, DAlba, JMoiton, M-PKuli, BLugagne-Delpon, NMourlan, CJaffar-Bandjee, M-CEnglish AbstractJournal ArticleFrancePathol Biol (Paris). 2010 Feb;58(1):18-24. doi: 10.1016/j.patbio.2009.07.021.
