The patient presented 30Â days post HSCT with fever and lymphadenitis. Lymph node, blood, and gastric aspirates were positive for M.Â bovis. The patient received a prolonged treatment course with a combination of isoniazid, levofloxacin, and ethambutol. Her course was further complicated by granulomatous lymphadenitis and otitis media associated with M.Â bovis that developed during immune suppression taper and immune reconstitution.

Observation A masculin infant was born at full term pregnancy to a healthy mother by cesarian section because of rupture of membranes and acute fetal distress. He was normal within 48 h of life and C reactive protein (CRP) was negative, so he was discharged from the hospital. He presented at the age of 3 days erythematous pultaceous lesions of the face without fever. He was hospitalised at the age of 5 days. On examination, we noted on his face, neck and back multiple shallow erosions and flaccid pus-filled bullae, varying in size. Investigations including complete hemogram, renal function tests and CRP had results within normal limits. A smear from a pustular lesion and blood culture were done. The infant was started on intravenous oxacillin (100 mg/kg/day) and gentamicin (5 mg/kg/day). The culture of the two samples was positive for MRSA which was resistant to kanamycin and fusidic acid. Antibiotic therapy was modified by vancomycin and pristinamycin for total treatment duration of 14 days. The outcome was favourable with rapid regression of skin lesion. Search by PCR of the mecA gene and the gene encoding Panton-Valentine Leukocidine was positive for the 2 strains of MRSA isolated from blood culture and pustule.

The objective was analyze clinical, epidemiological, microbiological and outcome features of neonates with CA-Sa infection Methods {\&} Materials: Prospective observational study. We included previously healthy patients (p) â‰_ 30 days of age admitted in the neonatal unit with CA-Sa infection from 2006 to 2014. We defined CA-Sa infection based on CDC guidelines. Results: We included 37 healthy neonates with CA-Sa infection. Twenty nine (78{\%}) were born by vaginal labor. Mean gestational age was 39 weeks (r: 35-41), weight 3279 grams (r: 2500-4450). Patients had less than 3 birth hospital days in 95{\%} of cases. Contact with parental soft tissue infections were present in 38{\%}, 65{\%} of them were associated with maternal forunculosis. Nineteen p (51{\%}) were female. Mean age at admission was 18 days (r: 4-30). Thirty four p (92{\%}) had skin and soft tissue involved at admission, with celulitis, bullous impetigo, pustulosis, chest, facial/neck, inguinal and goin abscesses and mastitis. Fifteen p (40{\%}) also had invasive disease: sepsis, omphalitis, osteoarthritis, orbital cellulitis, cerebral abscess, meningitis, liver abscess and necrotizing pneumonia. Only 3p with invasive disease (osteoarthritis: 1p, otitis:1p and pleuropulmonar infection: 1p) didn't have skin and soft tissue manifestation at admission. Positive culture was obtained in 33p (89{\%}) from purulent effusion, and 4 (11{\%}) from blood culture alone. Between 37 CA-Sa infections, 27 (72{\%}) were MRSA and 11{\%} were clindamycin resistant too. All patients were treated with antibiotics and in 24p (65{\%}) surgical drainage was performed. Thirty four p (92{\%}) received sequential parenteral -oral treatment with a mean duration of 21 days (r: 1-60d). Median hospital stay was 12 days (r: 4-60). One patient (2, 7{\%}) died because of sepsis and necrotizing pneumonia.

All isolates were genotyped using multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) and 20 isolates representing different MLVA types (MT) were chosen for multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Minimal inhibitory concentrations against clinically relevant antibiotics were determined with agar dilution. Presence of the virulence genes esp and hyl was investigated using PCR. RESULTS: A total of 65{\%} (n = 109) of all isolates belonged to MT-1, and the second most common MLVA type was MT-159 (13{\%}, n = 21). MLST analysis confirmed the presence of CC17 during the entire study period. The number of isolates resistant to gentamicin and vancomycin, as well as the presence of hyl, increased significantly during the investigation period. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that nosocomial infections caused by Ent. faecium CC17 are commonly occurring in Sweden. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first report of CC17 Ent. faecium in Sweden.

We report an outbreak of NDM-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae in patients with no prior travel history to endemic regions.Methods.Five NDM-1-producing K. pneumoniae colonizing and/or clinically infecting patients in a community tertiary hospital were detected between October and November 2011. NDM-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae (K. pneumoniae and Escherichia coli) were clinically and epidemiologically characterized, including susceptibility profiles, molecular typing, and molecular characterization of plasmids and resistant determinants.Results.Five patients were identified carrying NDM-1-producing K. pneumoniae, all of them epidemiologically linked with each other. K. pneumoniae were confirmed to belong to the same clone, exhibiting multidrug-resistant phenotypes. One patient was positive for NDM-1-producing E. coli in blood and E. coli and K. pneumoniae in rectal specimens, both containing the same blaNDM plasmid, suggesting horizontal transfer between species in the patient. No environmental sources of these strains were found. Detection of positive isolates directly from rectal specimens allowed the rapid identification and isolation of colonized patients.Conclusions.We report a NDM-1-producing K. pneumoniae outbreak in Ontario, Canada. Implementation of standard infection control practices, including active screening was able to contain the spread of this organism in the hospital setting. Of concern is the potential loss of a travel history to identify patients that are at high risk of being colonized or infected with this organism and the lack of an accurate, cost-effective test that can be implemented in the hospital setting to identify these multidrug-resistant organisms. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Author.",S Borgia and O Lastovetska and D Richardson and A Eshaghi and J Xiong and C Chung and M Baqi and A McGeer and G Ricci and R Sawicki and R Pantelidis and D E Low and S N Patel and R G Melano,"1058-48381537-6591",Clinical Infectious Diseases,"Canada,Escherichia coli infection,Guyana,Klebsiella pneumoniae infection,New Delhi metallo beta lactamase 1,adult,aged,antibiotic sensitivity,article,bacterial colonization,bacterium detection,bacterium isolate,bla new delhi metallo beta lactamase 1 gene,carbapenem,clinical article,community acquired pneumonia,comorbidity,diabetic foot,emergency ward,epidemic,female,gastrointestinal hemorrhage,gene,gene sequence,hepatic encephalopathy,horizontal gene transfer,hospital admission,hospital discharge,human,human cell,infection control,male,metallo beta lactamase,molecular typing,multidrug resistance,osteomyelitis,palliative therapy,patient care,patient identification,phenotype,polymerase chain reaction,priority journal,pyelonephritis,real time polymerase chain reaction,tertiary health care,tigecycline,travel,typhoid fever,unclassified drug",e109--e117,"{Outbreak of carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae containing bla NDM-1, Ontario, Canada}",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L366035722 http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/cid/cis737 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=10584838{\&}id=doi:10.1093{\%}2Fcid{\%}2Fcis737{\&}atitle=Outbreak+of+carbapenem-res,55,2012,11,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,YES,Cale,MAYBE,Mushtaq,Mushtaq,Zach_2,yes,,

Triple resistance to the evaluated agents was uncommon and was detected in 1{\%} of the untreated children, 3.5{\%} of the untreated adults and 13.6{\%} of the treated adults. Five H. pylori strains were resistant to amoxicillin, metronidazole and clarithromycin, two of them exhibiting quadruple resistance. Resistance to four of the five antibacterials tested was found in 0.7{\%} of the untreated and 1.8{\%} of the treated adults. The overall level of multidrug resistance in the treated adults (15.4{\%}) was higher than that in the untreated adults (4.2{\%}, P=0.0001) and the untreated children (1{\%}, P=0.0001). The presence of multidrug H. pylori resistance in Bulgaria could be associated with many factors, among them the slightly increasing national use of macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramins and of quinolones since 2000, the significant increase in primary H. pylori clarithromycin resistance, the high tetracycline use between 1994 and 1999, and, in individual cases, the use of azithromycin-based regimens or reuse of nitroimidazoles. In conclusion, for the first time in a European country during the last 5 years, H. pylori strains harbouring a worrying quadruple antibacterial resistance were found in treated as well as in untreated patients.

A subset of 138 suspected extended-spectrum cephalosporinase (ESC) producers were examined for genes encoding cephalosporin resistance. Forty-three isolates harboring bla(CTX-M-14) or bla(CTX-M-15) were analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and plasmids containing these genes were typed using PCR-based replicon typing (PBRT). Thirteen phylogroup B2 bla(CTX-M-14)- and bla(CTX-M-15)-positive isolates were analyzed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). A frequent occurrence of resistance ({\textgreater}46{\%}) was observed toward cephalosporins, gentamicin, and fluoroquinolones. Among the 222 isolates, 4 qnrS1, 4 qepA, and 16 aac(6')-Ib-cr genes were confirmed.

Here we report a case of successfully treated multiple liver abscess due to CRKP in a liver transplanted patient. Case report A 65-year-old Caucasian woman underwent liver transplant. The patient had no significant medical background except for chronic renal failure; pretransplant cultures resulted negative for MDR bacteria. The postoperative course (p.o.) was characterized by biliary anastomotic-fistula which required an hepaticojejunostomy. During the p.o. course an ESBL-producing E. Aerogenes and K. Pneumoniae resistant to all the antibiotics tested (apart for intermediate sensitivity to gentamycin and tygecicline) were isolated from throat swabs. The patient despite being colonized by CRKP was doing well and discharged. Two months later, she was readmitted for the abrupt onset of fever. A CT scan revealed the presence of multiple abscesses in the liver graft (max diameter 3.5 cm). Teicoplanin, anidulafungin and a weaning of the immunosuppressive therapy were the initial empiric therapy. Blood cultures resulted positive for both E. coli and Klebsiella Pneumoniae, confirming the previous isolated colonizating microorganisms. Fluid samples from the percutaneous drain in the liver abscesses tested positive for the same CRKP strain. The treatment strategy consisted of prolonged antimicrobial combination (meropenem, tygecycline and gentamicin) and drainage of the abscesses As long-time therapy and to preserve renal function, the antimicrobial therapy was then switched to ertapenem and tigecycline. On p.o. day 88, a PET-CT revealed a good response with substantial recovery and only residual activity; the therapy for CRKP was stopped and the patient discharged in good clinical condition. At the moment the patient is doing well with complete recovery of the liver lesions.

6995,MAYBE,Garland2011,Article,"Intrapartum chemoprophylaxis for pregnant group B streptococcus (GBS) carriers reduces vertical transmission, with a resultant decrease in neonatal as well as maternal morbidity from invasive GBS infection. Current Australian guidelines recommend penicillin for intrapartum prophylaxis of GBS carriers, with erythromycin or clindamycin for those with a beta-lactam allergy. Recent reports globally suggest that resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin may be increasing; hence, a study was undertaken to promote an evidence base for local clinical guidelines. Samples collected for standardized susceptibility testing included 1160 invasive GBS isolates (264 isolates retrospectively from 1982 to 2001 and prospectively from 2002 to 2006, plus 896 prospectively collected colonizing GBS isolates gathered over a 12 month period from 2005 to 2006) from 16 laboratories around Australia. All isolates displaying phenotypic macrolide or lincosamide resistance were subsequently genotyped. No isolates showed reduced susceptibility to penicillin or vancomycin. Of the invasive isolates, 6.4 {\%} demonstrated phenotypic erythromycin resistance and 4.2 {\%} were clindamycin resistant. Of the erythromycin-resistant isolates, 53 {\%} showed cross-resistance to clindamycin. Very similar results were found in colonizing specimens. There was no statistically significant change in macrolide-resistance rates over the two study periods 1982-2001 and 2002-2006. Genotyping for macrolide and lincosamide-resistant isolates was largely consistent with phenotype. These findings suggest that penicillin therapy remains an appropriate first-line antibiotic choice for intrapartum GBS chemoprophylaxis, with erythromycin and/or clindamycin resistance being low in the Australian population. It would, nevertheless, be appropriate for laboratories screening for GBS in obstetric patients to consider macrolide sensitivity testing, particularly for those with beta-lactam allergy, to ensure appropriate chemoprophylaxis.",S M Garland and E Cottrill and L Markowski and C Pearce and V Clifford and D Ndisang and N Kelly and A J Daley,0022-2615,J Med Microbiol,"*Drug Resistance, Bacterial,Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology,Australia,Female,Genes, Bacterial,Humans,Infant, Newborn,Pregnancy,Streptococcal Infections/*microbiology,Streptococcus agalactiae/*drug effects/*isolation",230--235,{Antimicrobial resistance in group B streptococcus: the Australian experience},NA,60,2011,Pt 2,"1473-5644Garland, Suzanne MCottrill, ErinMarkowski, LisaPearce, ChrisClifford, VanessaNdisang, DanielKelly, NigelDaley, Andrew JAustralasian Group for Antimicrobial Resistance-GBS Resistance Study GroupJournal ArticleEnglandJ Med Microbiol. 2011 Feb;60(Pt 2):230-5. doi: 10.1099/jmm.0.022616-0.

7585,YES,Gottig2013,Article,"OBJECTIVES: This study characterized a new variant of the New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM). METHODS: A multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli isolate was recovered from the wounds, throat and rectum of a Yemeni patient who presented at the Frankfurt University Hospital in Germany. The presence of beta-lactamase genes was analysed by PCR and sequencing. The isolate was further characterized by susceptibility testing, conjugation and transformation assays and plasmid analysis. RESULTS: The E. coli isolate was resistant to all beta-lactams including carbapenems. By PCR analysis, the beta-lactamase genes blaCMY-2, blaCTX-M-15, blaTEM-1 and blaNDM were identified. Sequencing revealed a blaNDM gene that differed from blaNDM-1 by two point mutations at positions 388 (G--{\textgreater}A) and 460 (A--{\textgreater}C) corresponding to amino acid substitutions Asp130Asn and Met154Leu, respectively. This NDM variant was identified as NDM-7. The blaNDM-7 gene was located on a self-transferable IncX3 plasmid of 60 kb. E. coli TOP10 transformants harbouring NDM-7 showed higher MICs of beta-lactams including carbapenems compared with transformants harbouring NDM-1. Multilocus sequence typing analysis revealed that the E. coli isolate belonged to a novel sequence type (ST599). CONCLUSIONS: This study identified a novel NDM variant in E. coli, NDM-7, possessing a high ability to hydrolyse beta-lactam antibiotics. Given the diversity of NDM variants located on self-transferable plasmids found in different Gram-negative species and isolated in different countries, the blaNDM gene will most likely efficiently disseminate worldwide.",S Gottig and A G Hamprecht and S Christ and V A Kempf and T A Wichelhaus,0305-7453,J Antimicrob Chemother,"Bacterial Proteins/*genetics/*secretion,Conjugation, Genetic,DNA, Bacterial/genetics,Enterobacteriaceae,Escherichia coli Infections/*microbiology,Escherichia coli/*drug effects/*enzymology/genetic,Genotype,Germany,Humans,IncX3,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Multilocus Sequence Typing,Ndm-1,Pharynx/microbiology,Plasmids,Polymerase Chain Reaction,Rectum/microbiology,Transformation, Bacterial,Wounds and Injuries/microbiology,antibiotic resistance,beta-Lactamases/*genetics/*secretion,carbapenems",1737--1740,"{Detection of NDM-7 in Germany, a new variant of the New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase with increased carbapenemase activity}",NA,68,2013,8,"1460-2091Gottig, StephanHamprecht, Axel GChrist, SaraKempf, Volkhard A JWichelhaus, Thomas AJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tEnglandJ Antimicrob Chemother. 2013 Aug;68(8):1737-40. doi: 10.1093/jac/dkt088.

The incidence of community-acquired infection due to such bacteria is increasing, but few cases of infant upper urinary tract infection (UUTI) have been reported in Japan. We treated four infants with UUTI caused by ESBL-producing Escherichia coli, as determined by genotyping. Using medical records, we retrospectively evaluated the clinical course, antibiotic use and efficacy, antimicrobial susceptibility results, and the presence of underlying disease. One of the four had been previously hospitalized for occult bacteremia. Two developed UUTI after antibiotic treatment, indicating that previous antibiotic use may have been a risk factor in these cases. We could not identify the infection route in all cases. Two of the four had bilateral vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Renal scintigraphy was done in three. Although an initial dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) defect was detected in all four, only one had renal scarring. E. coli isolates from all four showed PCR signals for blaCTX-M-; one isolate positive for the blaCTX-M3 group and three positive for blaCTX-M14. Antimicrobial susceptibility test results showed all isolates to be resistant to cephalosporins, but discrepancies existed between antimicrobial susceptibility results and actual clinical efficacy. Clinically, cefazolin (CEZ) was effective in two subjects and ceftazidime (CAZ) effective in one. Panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP) was effective in one. None of the four developed sepsis or meningitis.

8670,MAYBE,Hirsch2010a,Article,"Bacteria producing Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases (KPCs) are rapidly emerging as a cause of multidrug-resistant infections worldwide. Bacterial isolates harbouring these enzymes are capable of hydrolysing a broad spectrum of beta-lactams including the penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems and monobactam. Detection of isolates harbouring carbapenemases can be inconsistent using automated systems, often requiring subsequent confirmatory tests. Phenotypic methods utilizing boronic acid disc tests have demonstrated promising results and appear practical for use in clinical microbiology laboratories. Treatment of infection caused by KPC bacteria is particularly worrisome as the carbapenems are often agents of the last resort for resistant Gram-negative infections. The optimal treatment of infections caused by KPC bacteria is not well established and clinical outcome data remain sparse. We reviewed the current literature regarding clinical outcomes following KPC infections, with a specific effort to summarize the clinical data available for specific antimicrobial agents. A total of 15 papers involving 55 unique patient cases were reviewed. While the total number of patients is relatively small, some useful insights could still be gathered to guide clinicians in the management of KPC infections. Tigecycline and the aminoglycosides were associated with positive outcomes in the majority of cases. Clinical success rates were low when the polymyxins were used as monotherapy, but were much higher when they were used in combination.

9010,MAYBE,Hu2013,Article,"The emergence of NDM-1 has become established as a major public health threat and represents a new and major challenge in the treatment of infectious diseases. A total of 39 carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates collected from patients receiving care at 5 teaching hospitals in Jiangxi province, central China, were analyzed for carriage of resistance genes, including blaNDM-1. Two carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates (NC12 and NC18) were found to harbor blaNDM-1. In addition to blaNDM-1, NC12 also carried blaSHV-1, while NC18 harbored additional resistance genes, including blaSHV-12, blaCTX-M-14, armA and blaTEM-1. NC12 and NC18 belonged to ST15 and novel ST1031 and were clonally unrelated. Carbapenem resistance for NC12 could be transferred to Escherichia coli recipients through conjugation and chemical transformation, while carbapenem resistance for NC18 was only transferred to E. coli recipients by chemical transformation. The EcoR1-digested DNA pattern of plasmids from the transformants of NC12 was identical to that for NC18. Taken together, this is the first report of blaNDM-1 carriage by K. pneumoniae clinical isolates in mainland China, indicating that blaNDM-1 is disseminated among Enterobacteriaceae in China. Systemic surveillance should focus on the dissemination of blaNDM-1 among Gram-negative clinical isolates, especially some major clones, such as K. pneumoniae ST15 which is a major clone among CTX-M-15-producing isolates. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.",L Hu and Q Zhong and J Tu and Y Xu and Z Qin and C Parsons and B Zhang and X Hu and L Wang and F Yu and J Pan,0732-8893,Diagnostic Microbiology and Infectious Disease,",*Molecular Typing,80 and over,Aged,Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology,Bacterial,Carbapenems/pharmacology,China,China/epidemiology,Conjugation,Escherichia coli,Gene Transfer,Genetic,Genotype,Horizontal,Hospitals,Humans,Klebsiella Infections/epidemiology/*microbiology,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Klebsiella pneumoniae infection,Klebsiella pneumoniae/*classification/*enzymology/,Male,Teaching,Transformation,Young Adult,adult,aged,amikacin,ampicillin,antibiotic resistance,antibiotic sensitivity,article,aztreonam,bacterial gene,bacterium isolate,bacterium transformation,beta lactamase,beta lactamase NDM 1,beta lactamase SHV 1,beta lactamase SHV 12,beta lactamase TEM 1,beta lactamase ctx m 14,beta-Lactam Resistance,beta-Lactamases/*secretion,carbapenem,case report,cefepime,cefotaxime,cefoxitin,ceftazidime,ceftriaxone,ciprofloxacin,conjugation,cotrimoxazole,fosfomycin,gentamicin,human,imipenem,levofloxacin,linezolid,male,meropenem,methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus,minimum inhibitory concentration,nonhuman,piperacillin,piperacillin plus tazobactam,polymyxin B,priority journal,purification,teicoplanin,tigecycline,unclassified drug",373--376,{Emergence of blaNDM-1 among Klebsiella pneumoniae ST15 and novel ST1031 clinical isolates in China},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L52466920 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2013.01.006 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=07328893{\&}id=doi:10.1016{\%}2Fj.diagmicrobio.2013.01.006{\&}atit,75,2013,4,"From Duplicate 2 (Emergence of blaNDM-1 among Klebsiella pneumoniae ST15 and novel ST1031 clinical isolates in China - Hu, L; Zhong, Q; Tu, J; Xu, Y; Qin, Z; Parsons, C; Zhang, B; Hu, X; Wang, L; Yu, F; Pan, J)1879-0070Hu, LonghuaZhong, QiaoshiTu, JinjingXu, YuanyuanQin, ZhiqiangParsons, ChrisZhang, BailingHu, XiaoyanWang, LiangxingYu, FangyouPan, JingyeCase ReportsJournal ArticleUnited StatesDiagn Microbiol Infect Dis. 2013 Apr;75(4):373-6. doi: 10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2013.01.006.

9049,MAYBE,Huang2015c,Article,"BACKGROUND: Carbapenem resistance among the Enterobacteriaceae is a serious healthcare challenge. bla IMI is a carbapenemase gene mediating resistance to carbapenems but has not been commonly found. A bla IMI-carrying Enterobacter cloacae, which was also resistant to colistin, is reported here. FINDINGS: E. cloacae strain WCHECl-1060 was recovered from a blood sample of a leukemia patient, who was not previously exposed to colistin. Strain WCHECl-1060 belongs to a new sequence type, ST410, and was resistant to carbapenems and colistin but was susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins. A new allelic variant of bla IMI-1, which has two silent mutations compared to the original bla IMI-1 variant, was found in strain WCHECl-1060. Conjugation and transformation experiments failed to transfer bla IMI-1, suggesting a likely chromosome origin. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first report of an IMI-1 carbapenemase-producing colistin-resistant E. cloacae in China. Microbiological laboratories should be aware of the unusual carbapenem-resistant but third-generation cephalosporin-susceptible profiles of these IMI-producing isolates.

Although they are mostly plant pathogens, R. radiobacter may cause human infections. The aim of this report was to present a case of R. radiobacter bacteremia treated with levofloxacin. Twenty-seven year old male patient had fever after receiving chemotherapy due to osteosarcoma. The infection focus could not be detected in the initial physical examination. Blood cultures were obtained from peripheral veins and central catheter and levofloxacin (500 mg/day) was started as empirical therapy. His fever resolved on the next day. Meanwhile cultures of blood (Bact/Alert automated systems, bioMerieux, Durham, NC) obtained from peripheral veins and central catheters yielded bacteria which were identified as R. radiobacter by VITEK 2 (bioMerieux Inc, Mercy L'etoil, France). The strain was resistant to amikacin and sensitive to ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, meropenem and piperacillin/tazobactam. The patient was diagnosed as catheter-related bacteremia and the treatment was continued for 14 days. His catheter was not removed since subsequent cultures did not reveal any bacterial growth. In conclusion this case suggests that R. radiobacter may cause infections especially in immunocompromised patients with catheters or prosthetic devices.

Materials and methods: During 2013-2014 we have isolated 15 cases of Salmonella enterica serotype Virchow from stool samples of patients admitted in Maharishi Valmiki Infectious Diseases Hospital (MVIDH), Kingsway Camp, Delhi, India. Rectal swab samples were processed as per WHO guidelines (CDC/WHO/ USAID, 2003). Antibiotic sensitivity test and MIC Antimicrobial sensitivity and MIC of all 15 Salmonella enterica serotype Virchow isolates were carried out by Kirby-Bauer ((Bauer et al., 1966; CLSI, 2013) disk diffusion method using commercially available antibiotic disks and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was carried out by agar dilution method as per CLSI guidelines 2013(CLSI, 2013). Results: Conformation of isolates. All 15 Salmonella enterica serotype Virchow was serologically confirmed Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Virchow (6,7,r:1,2) according to White-Kauffmann-Le Minor scheme. Antibiotic sensitivity assay All Salmonella enterica serotype Virchow were 100{\%} resistant to amikacin, gentamicin, nalidixic acid followed by cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin and 100{\%} sensitive to ampicillin, norfloxacin, ceftriaxone, chloramphenicol, and imipenem. The MIC of gentamicin resistant isolates having MIC of â‰¥512 $\mu$g/ml. Conclusion: In 2013 we have only got two Salmonella enterica serotype Virchow but in 2014 suddenly it emerged in Delhi NCR and all are gentamicin and amikacin resistant. The same clone emerged in both humans and poultry, indicating that poultry was probably the main source for Salmonella serovar Virchow in the food chain.

Methods: The tissue samples were collected by gastroscope biopsy from the outpatients and inpatients with gastric diseases from 2010 to 2012. 320 tissue samples cultured in microaerobic condition were identified as typical H. pylori strains by biochemical and slice checking methods. E-test method was used to measure the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of these identified H. pylori strains resistant to metronidazole, clarithromycin, tetracycline, Levofloxacin and amoxicillin. Drug sensitivity tests of furazolidone was performed by means of Kirby-Bane. Results: Among 320 H. pylori strains, the resistance rate to metronidazole was 71.25{\%}(228/320), and the MIC ranged from 0.016 mg/L to beyond 256 mg/L; to tetracycline, 5.31{\%}(17/320),MIC ranged from 0.016 mg/L to 32 mg/L;to clarithromycin, 16.88{\%}(54/320),MIC ranged from 0.016 mg/L to beyond 256 mg/L; to Levofloxacin, 14.38{\%}(46/320), MIC from 0.02 mg/L to beyond 256 mg/L; amoxicillin 1.25{\%}(4/320), MIC from 0.016 mg/L to 2 mg/L; furazolidone 0{\%}(0/320).

Materials and Methods: A multi resistant Morganella morganii SM12012 isolate was recovered from pus from a patient hospitalized in the intensive care unit at the Military hospital, Tunisia. Antibiotic susceptibility was tested with the agar disk diffusion method according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. ESBLs were detected using a standard double-disk synergy test. The characterization of beta-lactamases and associated resistance genes were performed by isoelectric focusing, polymerase chain reaction and nucleotide sequencing. Results: The antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed the high resistance to penicillins, cephalosporins (MICs: 64-512 $\mu$g/ml) and fluoroquinolones (MICs: 32-512 $\mu$g/ml). But M. morganii SM12012 isolate remained susceptible to carbapenems (MICs: 4-{\textless}0.25 $\mu$g/ml). The double-disk synergy test confirmed the phenotype of extended-spectrum $\beta$-lactamases (ESBLs). Three identical $\beta$-lactamases with pI values of 6.5, 7.8 and superior to 8.6 were detected after isoelectric focusing analysis. These $\beta$-lactamases genes can be successfully transferred by the conjugative plasmid. Molecular analysis demonstrated the co-production of bla DHA-1, bla CTX-M-15 and qnrS1 genes on the same plasmid. The detection of an associated chromosomal quinolone resistance revealed the presence of a parC mutation at codon 80 (Ser80-lle80). Conclusion: This is the first report in Tunisia of nosocomial infection due to the production of CTX-M-15 and DHA-1 $\beta$-lactamases in M. morganii isolate with the association of quinolone plasmid resistance.

Methods: Eight intensive care unit (ICU) patients infected/colonized by extended-spectrum $\beta$-lactamase (ESBL)-producing P. stuartii between March and May 2011 were included. Molecular epidemiology was studied by PFGE. Antibiotic resistance genes were analysed by PCR and sequencing and the plasmid incompatibility group by a PCR-based replicon typing scheme. Results: Eight patients were colonized with ESBL-producing P. stuartii isolates. All these isolates were clonally related and found to carry blaOXA-48, blaPER-1, blaCMY-4, qnrA6 and aac-6â€_-Ib genes on the same self-conjugative IncA/C plasmid. The same strain was also cultured from environmental samples in the ICU. All these isolates were susceptible to carbapenems. Only one colonized patient developed P. stuartii pleurisy and was effectively treated with imipenem alone. Conclusions: This is the first report of an outbreak due to P. stuartii isolates carrying blaOXA-48 in Tunisia. The simultaneous expression of various resistance genes (blaOXA-48, blaCMY-4, blaPER-1, qnrA and aac-6â€_-Ib) by P. stuartii isolates is alarming. {\textcopyright} The Author 2012.

14299,YES,Moodley2015,Article,"Multidrug resistant organisms such as vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) are an increasing threat to healthcare worldwide. This organism has been detected worldwide in adult and paediatric patients since the first description in 1986, with the first laboratory detection in South Africa in 1993. VRE were isolated, identified and their antimicrobial susceptibility profiles determined using the Vitek 2 system, from February-November 2013. Vancomycin MIC's were determined using the Etest method. Isolates were screened for the vanA/B/C genes with conventional PCR. Positive isolates were compared using pulsedfield gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Two patients with blood stream infections (BSI) cultured VRE, two days apart, in February 2013, at Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital. This was the first incidence of VRE at this facility and indicated the possibility of an outbreak. Active surveillance and heightened infection control were instituted to limit spread. 29 patients were subsequently screened for colonization with VRE, of which 2 were positive. In September and November 2013, 2 additional VRE were obtained from two patients with BSI's. Screening Results of 26 patients revealed 6 colonized patients. PCR Results indicated that all the VRE isolated possessed the vanA gene, which confers high-level resistance to glycopepetides. PFGE Results indicated a high level of genetic diversity between all the isolates. The initial 2 isolates shared high levels of genetic relatedness (92.5{\%}), indicating likely patient-to-patient transmission of the same clone. A second isolate from patient 2 shared 97.9{\%} homology with the isolate from patient 3. Two isolates from patient 4 had low homology with each other (61.1{\%}) and very low homology with other strains tested. Five of the screening isolates shared high levels of relatedness (?90{\%}) indicating possible spread during the outbreak. An outbreak of VRE in a paediatric hospital was detected.

15049,MAYBE,Nica2012a,Article,"Background. We performed a study to identify the resistance phenotypes to beta-lactam antibiotics of the Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae strains involved in infectious pathology. Methods. We performed a retrospective study of the strains isolated from patients hospitalized in the Clinical Hospital of Infectious and Tropical Diseases â€œDr. Victor BabeÅŸ.â€ù between January and September 2012. Antibioresistance phenotypes were identified through the standard diffusion method and the confirmation and determination of MIC values were made with the VITEK2C and E-test, according to CLSI 2011-2012. The â€œChampagne corkâ€ù synergism test induced by clavulanic acid was performed through the DDD method (Double Disc Diffusion), for the screening of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL)-producing strains. The resistance to beta-lactams (first thru third generation cephalosporins, monobactams, cephamycins; with the exception of fourth generation cephalosporins and carbapenems) produced by beta-lactamase AmpC were identified through screening of resistance to cefoxitin (30 Hg/disc), VITEK2C (MIC cefoxitin {\textgreater}8 ng/mL) and confirmed through the E-test method (AmpC-strip: cefotetan/ cefotetan plus cloxacillin CN/CNI). The modified Hodge-test was used for confirmation of resistance strains to carbapenems (MEM 30ug/disc, CMI ETP {\textgreater}8 ng/mL). Internal quality control: E coli ATCC 25923. Results. 320 Klebsiella pneumoniae and 57 Enterobacter cloacae strains were studied; 47.8{\%} were ESBL-positive K pneumoniae strains. Out of the 320 ESBL-positive Kpneumoniae isolates, 49 were resistant to cefoxitin: 0.6{\%} produced plasmid AmpC cephalosporinase (CN/CNI{\textgreater}8, E-test) and 14.7{\%} were resistant to cephamycins by impermeability mechanisms. 5{\%} of K pneumoniae strains presented ESBL-positive/CTX-M-like (cefotaximase). For 22/320 (6.8{\%}) K pneumoniae with MIC for ertapenem (ETP) {\textgreater}8ug/mL (resistant to imipenem/IPM, meropenem/MEM), the modified Hodge test and the screening IP/IPI (E-test) were performed: 5.6{\%}/ non-carbapenemases producing strains (porin loss and impermeability mechanisms); 0.6{\%} MBL-positive K pneumoniae; 0.6{\%} KPC-positive. 19.3{\%} of Enterobacter cloacae strains were ESBL-positive; 5.2{\%} ESBL-negative isolates were plasmid AmpC cephalosporinase-producing strains; 7.0{\%} metallo-beta-lactamases /MBL)-positive isolates. Conclusion. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae represent a continuous challenge in identification of the resistance mechanisms to beta-lactams; these strains are usually multidrug resistant and for this reason the therapeutical options are very limited. The identification of carbapenemases-producing strains is a necessary laboratory screening process for optimal treatment.

The aim of this study was to analyze carbapenem-resistant isolates of Enterobacter cloacae that have emerged for the first time in the intensive care unit (ICU) at the University Hospital Centre Split, Croatia. The strains were selected in the period between June and August 2012, according to their susceptibility patterns to carbapenems. Resistant isolates were screened for metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) production with the use of the imipenem-EDTA disk synergy test, and positive findings were confirmed by PCR. The type of VIM beta-lactamase gene was determined by sequencing of PCR products. The genetic relatedness was evaluated using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis. The demographic and clinical data were retrospectively analyzed from medical records. Five patients were infected and one patient was colonized with a single clone of multidrug-resistant VIM-1-producing E. cloacae susceptible only to colistin. Three cases of lower respiratory tract infections, one case of bacteremia, and one case of intra-abdominal infection were identified. All cases were hospital-acquired after prolonged stay in ICU. All patients had serious underlying diseases and received a broad-spectrum antibiotic. Four patients died and two had unimprovable medical condition at the time of discharge from the hospital.

Results: The ertapenem, imipenem and meropenem MIC ranges for the 8 isolates were 2-32, 0.125-8 and 0.125-4 $\mu$g/mL, respectively. Seven isolates produced CTX-M type ESBLs, whereas no AmpC was found. All isolates exhibited the ompF and two isolates did not contain the ompC. Alterations of the ompF included mutations, 3-bp or IS1 insertion, and/or 1-, 4-, 7- or 18-bp deletion, while those of the ompC were mutations and/or 1-, 9- or 12-bp deletion. Three different ERIC-PCR patterns were seen among the 8 isolates. In addition, closely related isolates from different patients showed different porin loss or alterations.

We have also observed a similar occurrence in our study involving colistin resistance from several countries along with a similar phenomenon being reported by researchers. The observation of colistin resistance in humans without prior colistin exposure is of particularly great clinical importance and concern because of the current importance of colistin in clinical medicine. Colistin use and colistin-resistant bacteria in animals have been recently reported, suggesting that animals could also be a source of transmission of colistin-resistant bacteria to humans.

16150,YES,Pathak2012a,Article,"Background: Recent reports of the rapid evolution of bacterial resistance in India require urgent antibiotic stewardship programs. This study aimed to define the magnitude and pattern of resistance of bacterial pathogens to guide empirical therapy. Methods: We prospectively collected consecutive, clinically significant, and nonduplicate bacterial isolates from each patient from two hospitals in Ujjain, India. The antibiotic susceptibility of the bacteria was tested using a disc diffusion method as recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. Results: A total of 716 pathogens were isolated from 2568 patients (median age, 25 years; range, 0 days to 92 years). Gram-negative infections were predominant (62{\%}). The isolated pathogens included Staphylococcus aureus (n = 221; 31{\%}), Escherichia coli (n = 149; 21{\%}), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 127; 18{\%}), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 107; 15{\%}). Common diagnoses included abscesses (56{\%}), urinary tract infections (14{\%}), blood stream infections (10{\%}), pneumonia (10{\%}), and vaginal infections (10{\%}). In E. coli isolates, 69{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 61.6-76.6) were extended-spectrum $\beta$-lactamase (ESBL) producers and 41{\%} (95{\%} CI 31.6-50.5) of K. pneumoniae isolates were ESBL producers. These isolates had a high resistance to fluoroquinolones and $\beta$-lactams, except for imipenem and piperacillin-tazobactam. Salmonella typhi remained sensitive to third-generation cephalosporins. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) constituted 30{\%} of all S. aureus isolates and showed resistance to ciprofloxacin (81{\%}), cotrimoxazole (76{\%}), and levofloxacin (60{\%}). Conclusion: Our results showed a high prevalence of ESBL among Gram-negative bacterial isolates and a high prevalence of MRSA among S. aureus isolates. Carbapenems provided the broadest coverage for Gram-negative bacteria, while glycopeptides were the most effective against MRSA; however, both classes of drugs need to be used judiciously. This study will help in planning future antibiotic stewardship programs. {\textcopyright} 2012 Pathak et al, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.",A Pathak and Y Marothi and V Kekre and K Mahadik and R Macaden and C S Lundborg,1178-6973,Infection and Drug Resistance,"Escherichia coli,India,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Pseudomonas aeruginosa,Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi,Staphylococcus aureus,adult,aged,antibiotic resistance,article,bacterial pneumonia,bacterial virulence,bacterium isolation,beta lactam,bloodstream infection,carbapenem,cephalosporin,ciprofloxacin,controlled study,cotrimoxazole,disease surveillance,disk diffusion,extended spectrum beta lactamase,extended spectrum beta lactamase producing Enterob,female,human,infant,levofloxacin,major clinical study,male,methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus,microbial sensitivity test,nonhuman,prevalence,prospective study,quinoline derived antiinfective agent,urinary tract infection,vaginitis",65--73,"{High prevalence of extended-spectrum $\beta$-lactamase-producing pathogens: Results of a surveillance study in two hospitals in Ujjain, India}",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L364869568 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=11786973{\&}id=doi:{\&}atitle=High+prevalence+of+extended-spectrum+$\beta$-lactamase-producing+pathogens{\%}3A+Results+of+a+,5,2012,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,MAYBE,Melanie,YES,Nchedo,Nchedo,Zach_2,yes,,

Both cases presented as infection in community-dwelling individuals in Australia and were associated with travel to the Indian Subcontinent. One isolate of Escherichia coli harbored the previously undescribed enzyme variant blaNDM-3, differing from blaNDM-1 by a single nonsynonymous SNP conferring a putative peptide sequence change at the 95th position (ASPâ†’ASN).

CA-MRSA tends to harbor staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec type IV (SCCmec IV), to be non-multiantibiotic resistant, and to have different genotypes from the local hospital-acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA). However, in Ireland, 80{\%} of HA-MRSA isolates have the non-multiantibiotic-resistant genotype ST22-MRSA-IV. This study investigated MRSA isolates from Ireland (CA-MRSA, health care-associated MRSA, and HA-MRSA) for the carriage of pvl and determined the genotypic characteristics of all pvl-positive isolates identified. All 1,389 MRSA isolates were investigated by antibiogram-resistogram typing and SmaI DNA macrorestriction analysis. pvl-positive isolates were further characterized by multilocus sequence typing and SCCmec, agr, and toxin gene typing. Twenty-five (1.8{\%}) MRSA isolates belonging to six genotypes (ST30, ST8, ST22, ST80, ST5, and ST154) harbored pvl. Nineteen of these (76{\%}) were CA-MRSA isolates, but a prospective study of MRSA isolates from 401 patients showed that only 6.7{\%} (2/30) of patients with CA-MRSA yielded pvl-positive isolates. Thus, pvl cannot be used as a sole marker for CA-MRSA. Fifty-two percent of pvl-positive MRSA isolates were recovered from patients with skin and soft tissue infections; thirty-six percent were from patients of non-Irish ethnic origin, reflecting the increasing heterogeneity of the Irish population due to immigration. All 25 pvl-positive isolates carried SCCmec IV; 14 (56{\%}) harbored SCCmec IV.1 or IV.3, and the remaining 11 isolates could not be subtyped.

This report describes the first KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates identified in Norway (n=6) and the second isolate from Sweden. METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility profiles were determined using Etest. PCR and sequencing were used to determine the bla(KPC) variant, the surrounding genetic structure and the presence of AmpC and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase genes. PFGE and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) were used for epidemiological comparisons. Localization of bla(KPC) was investigated by S1 nuclease digestion, followed by PFGE and Southern blot hybridization. RESULTS: All isolates expressed a multidrug-resistant phenotype with some variability in the carbapenem susceptibility profile. The Norwegian isolates carried bla(KPC-2), while the Swedish isolate carried bla(KPC-3). All isolates carried TEM-1, but were negative for bla(CTX-M) and bla(AmpC) genes. SHV-11 and SHV-12 were detected in the Norwegian isolates, while the Swedish isolate carried only SHV-11. Isolates from four patients were associated with import from Greece (n=3) and Israel. The other isolates were probably associated with local transmissions. PFGE and MLST showed that the isolates were clonally related, with three isolates displaying ST258, a single locus variant of ST11 previously associated with the clonal spread of CTX-M-15-producing K. pneumoniae in Hungary. In all isolates, bla(KPC) was located on plasmids as part of isoform a of Tn4401.

18812,MAYBE,Sendi2016,Article,"Streptococcus agalactiae (group B Streptococcus [GBS]) is a leading cause of sepsis in neonates. The rate of invasive GBS disease in nonpregnant adults also continues to climb. Aminoglycosides alone have little or no effect on GBS, but synergistic killing with penicillin has been shown in vitro. High-level gentamicin resistance (HLGR) in GBS isolates, however, leads to the loss of a synergistic effect. We therefore performed a multicenter study to determine the frequency of HLGR GBS isolates and to elucidate the molecular mechanisms leading to gentamicin resistance. From eight centers in four countries, 1,128 invasive and colonizing GBS isolates were pooled and investigated for the presence of HLGR. We identified two strains that displayed HLGR (BSU1203 and BSU452), both of which carried the aacA-aphD gene, typically conferring HLGR. However, only one strain (BSU1203) also carried the previously described chromosomal gentamicin resistance transposon designated Tn3706. For the other strain (BSU452), plasmid purification and subsequent DNA sequencing resulted in the detection of plasmid pIP501 carrying a remnant of a Tn3 family transposon. Its ability to confer HLGR was proven by transfer into an Enterococcus faecalis isolate. Conversely, loss of HLGR was documented after curing both GBS BSU452 and the transformed E. faecalis strain from the plasmid. This is the first report showing plasmid-mediated HLGR in GBS. Thus, in our clinical GBS isolates, HLGR is mediated both chromosomally and extrachromosomally.",P Sendi and M Furitsch and S Mauerer and C Florindo and B C Kahl and S Shabayek and R Berner and B Spellerberg,"1098-65960066-4804",Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy,"DNA flanking region,DNA sequence,Streptococcus agalactiae,adult,antibiotic resistance,article,bacterial gene,bacterial strain,bacterium identification,case report,chromosomal parameters,ciprofloxacin,genetic variability,gentamicin,group B streptococcal infection,high level gentamicin resistance,human,male,nonhuman,nucleotide sequence,priority journal,transposon",1702--1707,{Chromosomally and extrachromosomally mediated high-level gentamicin resistance in Streptococcus agalactiae},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L608798000 http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AAC.01933-15 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=10986596{\&}id=doi:10.1128{\%}2FAAC.01933-15{\&}atitle=Chromosomally+and+extrac,60,2016,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,MAYBE,Jake,NO,Erica,Allison,Zach_2,yes,,
18873,MAYBE,Serwin2014,Article,"Gonorrhoea, according to the latest World Health Organization (WHO) estimates in 2008, is the most frequent bacterial sexually transmitted infection globally, accounting for 106.1 million new cases among adults. Of those cases, 3.4 (3.2{\%}) million were in the WHO European Region. In the European Union and European Economic Area, the incidence of reported cases was 12.6 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2011. The highest incidences were noted in the United Kingdom (37.1), Latvia (24.4) and Ireland (18.6). However, in Poland from 2000 to 2011 the reported incidence declined and was only 0.8-0.9 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2011, that might indicate a suboptimal diagnostics and incomplete case reporting and epidemiological surveillance. A study surveying the diagnostics for gonorrhoea and the case reporting system, including the local and national epidemiological surveillance, in Poland is recommended. The high resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae to nearly all antimicrobials introduced for treatment of gonorrhoea is an exceedingly serious problem globally. A few years ago the first extensively-drug resistant N. gonorrhoeae strains with high-level resistance to ceftriaxone, the last remaining option for first-line empirical monotherapy, were reported. Due to this emergent situation, in 2012 the WHO and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) launched a global action plan and regional response plan, respectively, to combat the spread of multidrug resistant N. gonorrhoeae. Additionally, an updated European guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of gonorrhoea, recommending treatment with ceftriaxone together with azithromycin, was published in 2012. Worryingly, no antimicrobial susceptibility data for N. gonorrhoeae strains circulating in Poland have been internationally reported in several decades. It is imperative to implement some regular and quality assured antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance for N. gonorrhoeae in Poland and the official Polish treatment guidelines (from 1970s) recommending penicillin G as first-line treatment for gonorrhoea need to be promptly revised.",A B Serwin and M Koper and M Unemo,"0033-2100 (Print)0033-2100",Przegl Epidemiol,",*Drug Resistance,Adolescent,Adult,Aged,Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use,Azithromycin/therapeutic use,Bacterial,Ceftriaxone/therapeutic use,Epidemiological Monitoring,Europe,Europe/epidemiology,Female,Forecasting,Gonorrhea/*drug therapy/*epidemiology,Humans,Incidence,Internationality,Male,Middle Aged,Neisseria gonorrhoeae,Neisseria gonorrhoeae/drug effects,Penicillin G/therapeutic use,Poland,Poland/epidemiology,United Kingdom,United Kingdom/epidemiology,World Health Organization,Young Adult,adolescent,adult,aged,antibiotic resistance,antiinfective agent,article,azithromycin,ceftriaxone,drug effect,epidemiological monitoring,female,forecasting,gonorrhea,human,incidence,international cooperation,male,middle aged,penicillin G,world health organization,young adult","39--44,127--131",{Gonorrhoea in 21st century--international and Polish situation},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L373849768 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=00332100{\&}id=doi:{\&}atitle=Gonorrhoea+in+21st+century--international+and+Polish+situation.{\&}stitle=Przegl+Epidemi,68,2014,1,"From Duplicate 1 (Gonorrhoea in 21st century--international and Polish situation - Serwin, A B; Koper, M; Unemo, M)Serwin, Agnieszka BeataKoper, MartaUnemo, MagnusJournal ArticlePolandPrzegl Epidemiol. 2014;68(1):39-44, 127-31.",NA,7/10/14,"engpol",25004630,YES,Erica,NO,Mushtaq,Zach,Zach_2,yes,,

A case of persistent methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) bacteremia in the setting of right-sided endocarditis in a 38-year-old man with a history of intravenous drug use is presented. He developed de novo resistance to daptomycin during therapy after several courses of antibiotics, with subsequent clinical failure. Isolates were identified by molecular characterization to be community-acquired MRSA 10 (USA300). To the authors' knowledge, the present case was the first in Canada to involve the de novo development of daptomycin resistance with clinical failure due to MRSA during therapy for endocarditis. Clinicians and microbiologists must be aware of this phenomenon given the implications for treatment and transmission of the strain. It also raises questions regarding the use of daptomycin in settings of heavily pretreated patients with persistent MRSA bacteremia. {\textcopyright}2010 Pulsus Group Inc.

ST398 BSI incidence showed a seven-fold increase during the study period (0.002 per 1,000 patient days in 2007 vs. 0.014 in 2010). ST398 BSI isolates differed from the pig-borne multiresistant clone: 17/18 BSI isolates were methicillin susceptible and none was of t011, t034 or t108 pig-borne spa-types. ST398 BSI isolates had homogenous resistance patterns (15/18 with only Ery(r)) and prophagic content (all harboured the hlb-converting Sau3int phage). The clustering of BSI and pig-borne isolates by spa-typing and MLVA, the occurrence of Sau3int phage in BSI isolates and the lack of this phage in pig-borne isolates suggest that the emergence of BSI isolates could have arisen from horizontal transfer, at least of the Sau3int phage, in genetically diverse MSSA ST398 isolates. The acquisition of the phage likely plays a role in the increasing ability of the lysogenic ST398 isolates to colonize human. The mode of acquisition of the non pig-borne ST398 isolates by our 18 patients remains unclear. ST398 BSI were diagnosed in patients lacking livestock exposure and were significantly associated with digestive portals of entry (3/18 [16.7{\%}] for ST398 vs. 19/767 [2.5{\%}] for non ST398 BSI; p = .012).

METHODS: Susceptibility testing against first- and second-line drugs was performed on isolated Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains. Subsequently, the strains identified as XDR or TDR M tuberculosis were subjected to spoligotyping and variable numbers of tandem repeats (VNTR). RESULTS: Of 146 MDR-TB strains, 8 XDR isolates (5.4{\%}) and 15 TDR isolates (10.3{\%}) were identified. The remaining strains were either susceptible (67{\%}) or had other resistant patterns (20{\%}). Overall, the median of treatments and drugs previously received by MDR-TB patients was two courses of therapy of 15 months' duration with five drugs (isoniazid [INH], rifampicin [RF], streptomycin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide). The median of in vitro drug resistance for all studied cases was INH and RF. The XDR or TDR strains were collected from both immigrants (Afghan, 30.4{\%}; Azerbaijani, 8.6{\%}; Iraqi, 4.3{\%}) and Iranian (56.5{\%}) MDR-TB cases. In such cases, the smear and cultures remained positive after 18 months of medium treatment with second-line drugs (ethionamide, para-aminosalicylic acid, cycloserine, ofloxacin, amikacin, and ciprofloxacin). Spoligotyping revealed Haarlem (39.1{\%}), Beijing (21.7{\%}), EAI (21.7{\%}), and CAS (17.3{\%}) superfamilies of M tuberculosis. These superfamilies had different VNTR profiles, which eliminated the recent transmission among MDR-TB cases.

21983,MAYBE,Voulgari2013,Article,"Objectives: First detected in Enterobacteriaceae isolates in Turkey, the OXA-48 carbapenemase has gradually disseminated in the wider Mediterranean area and Europe. Despite reports from other European regions, until now no such isolates have been detected in Greece. We describe the characteristics of the first outbreak caused by OXA-48-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae in Greece. Methods: From December 2011 to March 2012, 13 ertapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates, which were positive by the modified Hodge test while remaining negative by phenotypic screening for metallo-$\beta$-lactamase (MBL) and KPC production, were recovered from nine patients. Patient records were retrieved to access patterns of acquisition. Resistance genes were identified by PCR and sequencing. ompK35, ompK36 and the genetic environment of the blaOXA-48 gene were investigated. Plasmid profiling, conjugation experiments, PFGE and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) were performed. Results: All isolates harboured the blaOXA-48 gene along with the blaCTX-M-15 and blaOXA-1 genes. The blaOXA-48 gene was located on a self-transferable IncL/M-type plasmid of {\~{}}62 kb, which harboured no other resistance genes. IS1999 was located upstream of the blaOXA-48 gene. Genetic disruptions of the ompK35 and ompK36 genes were not detected. The isolates belonged to a unique PFGE clone and MLST assigned them to sequence type ST11. All cases were characterized as hospital acquired and none of them was linked to immigration or history of travel in endemic areas. Conclusions: Carbapenem resistance due to MBL and KPC carbapenemases is currently on an endemic scale in Greece and this report highlights the wider undetected dissemination of yet another carbapenemase in this region. {\textcopyright} The Author 2012.

22703,MAYBE,Wormser2010,Article,"Background. Babesiosis is an emerging tickborne malaria-like infection principally caused by Babesia microti. This infection typically resolves either spontaneously or after administration of a 7-10-day course of azithromycin plus atovaquone or clindamycin plus quinine. Although certain highly immunocompromised patients may respond suboptimally to these drug regimens, unlike the situation with malaria there has been no reported evidence that the cause of treatment failure is infection with drug-resistant strains of B. microti. Methods. Emergence of drug resistance in B. microti was defined as the development of a microbiologic relapse (recurrent parasitemia or a marked increase in parasitemia) in association with both clinical and laboratory abnormalities indicative of active babesiosis in a patient after â‰¥ 28 days of uninterrupted antibabesia drug therapy and while still receiving treatment. Results. The clinical case histories of 3 highly immunocompromised patients who received a subcurative course of azithromycin-atovaquone associated with the eventual development of resistance to this drug regimen are described. One of the 3 patients died of complications related to babesiosis. Conclusions. B. microti may become resistant to azithromycin-atovaquone during the treatment of babesiosis with this combined drug regimen in highly immunocompromised patients. Although research is needed to de-termine the optimal therapy for highly immunocompromised patients with babesiosis, reducing the level of immunosuppression when possible would appear to be a desirable strategy. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

23199,MAYBE,Yu2014a,Article,"BACKGROUND: Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) infection is a serious public health problem. The third-generation extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ESCs) have been used as the first-line treatment for NG infection for almost three decades. However, in recent years, treatment failures with the oral third-generation ESCs have been reported worldwide. This study aimed to estimate worldwide susceptibility rates of NG to cefixime and cefpodoxime by analyzing data from all relevant published studies. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Two researchers independently searched five databases to identify studies on susceptibilities of NG to cefixime and cefpodoxime published between January 1, 1984 and October 15, 2012. A fixed-effect model was used to perform group analysis, and a chi2 test was employed to make subgroup comparison. Publication bias was assessed with the Begg rank correlation test. The pooled susceptibility rate of NG isolates to cefixime was 99.8{\%} (95{\%} CI: 99.7{\%}-99.8{\%}). The cefixime susceptibility rate of NG isolates from men was significantly lower than that from patients without information of gender or from men and women; the susceptibility rate of NG isolates from Asia was significantly lower than that from other continents; and the susceptibility rate of NG isolates collected before or during 2003 was significantly higher than that after 2003. The pooled susceptibility rate of NG isolates to cefpodoxime was 92.8{\%} (95{\%} CI: 89.0{\%}-95.3{\%}), which was lower than that to cefixime (92.8{\%} vs. 99.8{\%}, chi2 = 951.809, P{\textless}0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The susceptibility rate of NG isolates to cefixime varied with the gender of patients and geographical location from which NG isolates were collected, and declined with time. The reported lower susceptibility rate of NG isolates to cefixime and associated treatment failures, as well as the emergence of NG strains with cephalosporin resistance call for the more effective control of NG infection and the development of new antibiotics.",R X Yu and Y Yin and G Q Wang and S C Chen and B J Zheng and X Q Dai and Y Han and Q Li and G Y Zhang and X Chen,1932-6203,PLoS ONE,",Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use,Asia,Cefixime/*therapeutic use,Ceftizoxime/*analogs {\&} derivatives/therapeutic use,Female,Gonorrhea/*drug therapy/epidemiology/*microbiology,Humans,Male,Neisseria gonorrhoeae,Neisseria gonorrhoeae/isolation {\&} purification/*me,antibiotic sensitivity,article,bacterial strain,bacterium isolate,cefixime,cefpodoxime,controlled study,data base,drug screening,female,gender,geography,human,male,meta analysis (topic),minimum inhibitory concentration,nonhuman,patient information,population research,systematic review",e87849,{Worldwide susceptibility rates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates to cefixime and cefpodoxime: A systematic review and meta-analysis},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L373071452 http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0087849 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=19326203{\&}id=doi:10.1371{\%}2Fjournal.pone.0087849{\&}atitle=Worldwid,9,2014,1,"From Duplicate 2 (Worldwide susceptibility rates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates to cefixime and cefpodoxime: a systematic review and meta-analysis - Yu, R X; Yin, Y; Wang, G Q; Chen, S C; Zheng, B J; Dai, X Q; Han, Y; Li, Q; Zhang, G Y; Chen, X)1932-6203Yu, Rui-xingYin, YuepingWang, Guan-qunChen, Shao-chunZheng, Bing-jieDai, Xiu-qinHan, YanLi, QiZhang, Guo-yiChen, XiangshengJournal ArticleMeta-AnalysisResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tReviewUnited StatesPLoS One. 2014 Jan 31;9(1):e87849. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0087849. eCollection 2014.",10.1371/journal.pone.0087849,2/6/14,eng,24498212,YES,Erica,MAYBE,Zach,Zach,Zach_2,yes,,

In 2006, we showed that resistance to anti-tuberculosis drugs remained frequent in Sinaloa. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to describe drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) trends and to investigate the probability that patients acquire resistance to first-line anti-TB drugs on recurrence after treatment in Sinaloa. METHODS: Sputum specimens were collected from patients diagnosed with TB at all the health care institutions of Sinaloa during 1997-2005. Isolates were tested for susceptibility to first-line drugs. RESULTS: Among 671 isolates tested from 1997 to 2002, the overall resistance rate was 34.9{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 31.2-38.4) with a 1.2{\%} increase per year (Chi-square=4.258, p=0.03906). The prevalence of multi-drug resistance (MDR) was 17.9{\%} (95{\%} CI 14.9-20.7) with a 1.2{\%} increase per year (Chi-square=8.352, p=0.00385). Of 50 patients registered twice between 1997 and 2005, 15 were fully susceptible at first registration, of whom six (40{\%}) acquired drug resistance. Of 35 cases with any drug resistance at first registration, 21 (60{\%}) came to acquire resistance to at least one other drug. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of drug-resistant TB increased during 1997-2005 in Sinaloa.
