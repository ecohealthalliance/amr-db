E. coli isolates were collected over a 2-year period from patients presenting E. coli infections. Strains with reduced susceptibility to ertapenem and/or positive for ESBL were characterised with regard to antibiotic resistance, bla genes, phylogenetic groups, O25 serotyping, quinolone resistance, repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reaction (rep-PCR) profiles and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST). Of the 448 isolated E. coli, 94 (20.9 {\%}) were multidrug-resistant. One of them (1.1 {\%}) produced a blaOXA-48 and was identified as a B1 ST5 strain. The transposon bearing this gene was Tn1999.2. This strain was isolated from a patient coming from a border province with Tunisia, where this carbapenemase is endemic. In addition, 84 (18.8 {\%}) isolates among them produced an ESBL with predominance (97.6 {\%}) of blaCTX-M-15, which was coupled with qnr genes in 10.9 {\%}. ESBL-producing strains were mainly detected in phylogroups D and A. They displayed 20 rep-PCR profiles and all the clonally related isolates were of the same sequence type (ST). Ten strains (9.4 {\%}) belonged to the pandemic clone ST131.

385,MAYBE,Al-Derzi2013,Article,"Background: The wide misuse of broad spectrum antibiotics causes an increase in the rate of antibiotic resistance in Iraq. Data are limited on the prevalence, pattern of resistance, and factors associated with resistant organisms. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the isolation prevalence and antibiotic resistance rate of P. aeruginosa species isolated in the North of Iraq and to determine the optimum effect of a combination antibiogram and its potential role in empirical treatment. Patients and Methods: The study samples were collected from two cities: Mosul and Duhok. The Mosul samples were taken from in-patient specimens sent for culture and antibiotic sensitivity to Al-Salam Teaching Hospital over a threeyear period (2003-2005). Duhok samples were obtained mainly from outpatient specimens sent to the laboratory of one of the two main private hospitals in the city for another three-year period (2007-2009). P. aeruginosa was identified by conventional methods and API 20 E (Biomerieux). Their antibiotic susceptibility was tested using the Kirby-Bauer plate diffusion method. Detection of combination effects was performed on Duhok samples by in vitro testing of different antimicrobial combination patterns commonly used in routine empirical practice. For this purpose combinations were chosen of the top four individual drugs demonstrating the highest susceptibilities by the standard antibiogram. Results: Out of 8038 and 1878 clinical specimens submitted for culture in Mosul and Duhok, respectively, 180 and 21 clinically significant isolates of P. aeruginosa were isolated, resulting in a prevalence of 5.2{\%} and 1.6{\%}, respectively. The most common isolates were from pus, followed by urine specimens and ear discharges. The isolates in males were twice that of females. The pattern of resistance revealed that amikacin had the highest sensitivity (89.7{\%}) followed by imipenem, tobramycin and piperacillin (85.6{\%}, 84.1{\%}, and 82.1{\%}, respectively). Cefotaxime showed the lowest sensitivity rate (66.4{\%}) followed by ceftazidime, carbenicillin, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin (70.1{\%}, 74.6{\%}, 76.1{\%}, and 79.1{\%}, respectively). The study revealed that the optimum combination therapy with the highest sensitivity rate was the combination of amikacin with either piperacillin or imipenem (95.2{\%}) and piperacillin with tobramycin (95.2{\%}). Conclusions and Recommendations: A relatively high resistance rate to first-line anti-pseudomonal drugs was observed, which should lead to continuous evaluation of hospital and community resistance patterns. The use of optimum combination therapy should be considered in the rational use of anti-pseudomonas drugs.",N A Al-Derzi,1015-6321,Journal of the Bahrain Medical Society,"Iraq,Pseudomonas infection,adult,amikacin,antibiotic agent,antibiotic resistance,antibiotic sensitivity,antibiotic therapy,article,bacterium culture,bacterium isolation,carbenicillin,cefotaxime,ceftazidime,ciprofloxacin,ear,female,gentamicin,hospital patient,human,imipenem,major clinical study,male,nonhuman,outpatient,piperacillin,prevalence,private hospital,pus,tobramycin,urinalysis",11--16,{The pattern of antibiotic resistance of pseudomonas infections in the North of Iraq: Potential role of a combination antibiogram},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L369387522 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=10156321{\&}id=doi:{\&}atitle=The+pattern+of+antibiotic+resistance+of+pseudomonas+infections+in+the+North+of+Iraq{\%}253,24,2013,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,YES,Allison,MAYBE,Mushtaq,Mushtaq,Zach_4,yes,,

The prevalence of ESBL producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL-KP) strains isolated from patients has recently increased in Tunisia. We conducted this study to determine the prevalence and the genetic characterization of ESBL-KP in a Tunisian Hospital. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed antibiotic susceptibility testing, multiplex PCR, and DNA sequencing analysis on 118 non repetitive K. pneumonia strains isolated during three years, to determine the prevalence and genotypes of ESBL among K. pneumoniae clinical isolates. RESULTS: Most ESBL-producing K. pneumonia strains were isolated from hospitalized patients, especially in neonatal and pediatric wards. The resistance to other antibiotics was high. Most of the pathogens were isolated from the urinary tract (86.44{\%}). Carbapenems were the most effective antimicrobial agents followed by amikacin and fosfomycin. The rate of blaSHV, blaTEM, and blaCTX-M genes among the isolates was 89, 56.78, and 81.35{\%}, respectively. Sequencing revealed the amplicons encoding TEM-1, TEM-53, TEM-158, SHV-1, SHV-11, SHV-28, CTX-M-15, CTX-M-15-like. The blaCTX-M-15 was the dominant gene among Tunisian isolates, but this was the first report of blaTEM-53 and blaTEM-158 genes in the country.

Strains from all patients infected and/or colonized by MDRAB during outbreak periods were characterized using PFGE and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). The first outbreak appeared in the summer of 2009 involving 38 ICU patients: 25 from a Traumatology-Rehabilitation hospital (TRH) and 13 from a Medical-Surgery hospital (MSH). Between 2010 and 2011, outbreaks were limited to the MSH-ICU, affecting 9 and 11 patients, respectively. Two PFGE types were detected. In the 2009 outbreak, two clones were identified: profile 1 strains were isolated at the TRH, whilst profile 2 was isolated at the MSH. Only one clone was identified in the 2010 and 2011 outbreaks: the profile 2 clone detected at the MSH in 2009. After MLST analysis, a single sequence type (ST92) was identified. This suggested that an endemic strain could evolve and cause localized outbreaks in vulnerable patients. Multiplex PCR for OXA group enzymes yielded a positive result for blaOXA-58-like and blaOXA-51-like genes, and gene sequencing showed the presence of blaOXA-58. However, the absence of ISAba1 upstream of the blaOXA-51-like gene suggested the absence of OXA-51 expression.

This study was done to determine the frequency of ESBL-producing E coli and K pneumoniae species isolated from urine samples of our patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A study was conducted on 164 urine isolates (124 E coli and 40 K pneumoniae) in the laboratory Loghman Hakim Hospital in Tehran, Iran, in 2007. Microbial sensitivity tests were done on Mueller-Hinton agar plates with disk diffusion method. Broad-spectrum resistance was defined as resistance to ampicillin or cephalothin; ESBL resistance, as resistance of these bacteria to one of ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, or ceftizoxime; and MDR-ESBL; as resistance to 3 of the following antibiotic groups: trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, and nitrofurantoin. RESULTS: An ESBL resistance was detected in 52.5{\%} of isolates with K pneumoniae and 45.2{\%} of those with E coli. The MDR-ESBL pattern was detected in 26.8{\%} of the isolates. These included 30.0{\%} of the K pneumoniae and 25.8{\%} of the E coli isolates. Broad-spectrum resistance was detected in all K pneumoniae isolates and 87.9{\%} of 124 E coli isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed a high rate of ESBL resistant strain of E coli and K pneumoniae and the emergency of multiple drug resistance to these bacteria in our patients in Tehran, Iran.",Z Aminzadeh and M {Sadat Kashi} and M Sha'bani,"1735-8582 (Print)

1080,YES,Ashour2007,Article,"Purpose: Cancer patients are particularly susceptible to nosocomial infections because of their compromised immune system, and because of the nature of treatment practices they experience. Recently, a shift of the microbial spectrum of cancer patients from Gram-negative to Gram-positive has been demonstrated. This study analyzed the distribution and the antimicrobial resistance of Gram-positive bacteria isolated from cancer patients in Egypt. Patients and Methods: We examined the microbial spectrum of Gram-positive bacteria in patients with hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. In addition, we also studied the antimicrobial resistance of pathogens accounting for the majority of Gram-positive infections in these cancer patients. Results: Most of Gram-positive isolates from urinary tract (100{\%}), respiratory tract (89.7{\%}), and bloodstream infections (BSIs; 65.5{\%}) were obtained from leukemic patients. All Gram-positive isolates from skin infections were isolated from solid-tumor patients. In both leukemic and solid-tumor patients, Gram-positive bacteria causing nosocomial BSI were mainly Coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CNS) and S aureus, whereas Gram-positive bacteria causing nosocomial RTI were mainly $\alpha$-hemolytic streptococci and CNS. Gram-positive bacteria were not isolated from GI tract infections. S aureus, CNS, and $\alpha$-hemolytic streptococci demonstrated methicillin resistance (81.5{\%}, 92.3{\%}, and 90{\%} resistance, respectively). S aureus and CNS were susceptible to linezolid (15.4{\%} and 0{\%} resistance, respectively), and vancomycin (15.5{\%} and 11{\%} resistance, respectively). Conclusion: This is the first study to report the emergence of vancomycin- and linezolid-resistant S aureus in Egypt. Newer generation quinolones (moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin) were more active than older quinolones (ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin) against S aureus and CNS, suggesting the use of newer generation quinolones in the prophylaxis of cancer patients. {\textcopyright} 2007 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",H M Ashour and A El-Sharif,0732-183X,Journal of Clinical Oncology,",Anti-Infective Agents,Cross Infection/*microbiology,Egypt,Gram-Positive Bacteria/*isolation {\&} purification,Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections/complications/*,Humans,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Neoplasms/*complications,Staphylococcus aureus,Staphylococcus epidermidis,Staphylococcus haemolyticus,Staphylococcus hominis,alpha hemolytic Streptococcus,antibiotic sensitivity,article,bacterium isolation,cancer patient,cancer research,hospital infection,human,leukemia,linezolid,priority journal,respiratory tract infection,skin infection,solid tumor,urinary tract infection,vancomycin",5763--5769,{Microbial spectrum and antibiotic susceptibility profile of gram-positive aerobic bacteria isolated from cancer patients},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L351024725 http://dx.doi.org/10.1200/JCO.2007.14.0947 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=0732183X{\&}id=doi:10.1200{\%}2FJCO.2007.14.0947{\&}atitle=Microbial+spectr,25,2007,36,"From Duplicate 2 (Microbial spectrum and antibiotic susceptibility profile of gram-positive aerobic bacteria isolated from cancer patients - Ashour, H M; el-Sharif, A)

1126,YES,Atalar2013,Article,"Introduction and Objectives: Selecting correct antibiotic prophylaxis before surgery is of increasing importance, with the emergence of resistant bacterial strains. Furthermore it is important to target the causative organisms with appropriate antibiotics, as illustrated in guidelines for stone procedures. We reviewed our prospectively captured database of patients undergoing endourological stone surgery over a 12 month period, to assess the types of organism and the antibiotic resistance patterns now emerging. Materials and Methods: We reviewed the records of all patients undergoing ureterorenoscopy/ percutaneous nephrolithotomy/ cystolithopaxy during a 12 month period, under the care of 2 surgeons. Pre-operative urine cultures were recorded, with the antibiotic resistance patterns; positive cultures were treated by antibiotics before surgery, and followed up to ensure the repeat cultures were subsequently negative. Results: From a total of 287 patients, 36 had a positive urine culture requiring antibiotic treatment before surgery. E Coli was the commonest organism (n=11), with ESBL (extended spectrum beta-lactamase) accounting for 3 of these cases; followed by Enterococcus faecalis (n=9), Pseudomonas (n=4), Coliforms (n=4), Klebsiella, Morganella, and Enterobacter cloacae (all n=1). The multi-resistant strains showed sensitivities to Meropenem, Ertapenem and Mecillinam. Conclusion: Our results are consistent with previous reports (BJUI 2009; 104: 760-4) showing that the 2 predominant organisms causing urine infection are E Coli and Enterococcus (Streptococcus) faecalis; it is therefore important to ensure that both Gram positive and negative organisms are covered if antibiotic prophylaxis is to be used in such surgery. Worryingly there is an increase in multiresistant patterns, leaving few available oral antibiotic choices, as particularly demonstrable in the ESBL cases. We have noted further emergence of resistance to co-amoxiclav, trimethoprim and ciprofloxacin, and reiterate the advice of guidelines that antibiotic prophylaxis in endourology (J Endourol 2009; 23: 1567- 70) should be rationalised according to findings of such microbiological reviews.",K Atalar and H Donaldson and A Shamsuddin and R Dasgupta,0090-4295,Urology,"Enterobacter cloacae,Enterococcus faecalis,Escherichia coli,Klebsiella,Morganella,Pseudomonas,amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid,antibiotic agent,antibiotic prophylaxis,antibiotic resistance,antibiotic therapy,bacterial strain,ciprofloxacin,data base,endourology,ertapenem,extended spectrum beta lactamase,human,mecillinam,meropenem,organisms,patient,procedures,surgeon,surgery,trimethoprim,urinary tract infection,urine culture",S110,{Selecting antibiotics for stone surgery},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L71352245 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=00904295{\&}id=doi:{\&}atitle=Selecting+antibiotics+for+stone+surgery{\&}stitle=Urology{\&}title=Urology{\&}volume=82{\&}issue=3,82,2013,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,YES,Allison,YES,Nchedo,Nchedo,Zach_4,no,could not find full-text,

Materials and methods: A prospective surveillance study was performed from January 2006 through December 2007 in the medical and surgical wards of the İzmir Teaching and Research Hospital. Results: During the study period, data on 57,133 patients with a total of 413,515 patient-days were analyzed. A total of 106 HAP episodes occurred in 99 patients. The infection rate per 100 patients and per 1000 patient-days was found to be 0.2{\%} and 0.3{\%}, respectively. HAP episodes were detected mostly in medical wards (66{\%}). The mean age of patients was 58.6 ± 15.9 and 73{\%} of the patients were male. The most common intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors observed in patients with HAP, according to the first episode, were cardiovascular disease (47{\%}), central nervous system disease (41{\%}), malignancy (40{\%}), hospitalization longer than 5 days (91{\%}), antibiotic therapy (81{\%}), previous endotracheal intubation (40{\%}), nasogastric tubes (38{\%}), and H2 receptor antagonist/antiacid (37{\%}). Moreover, 109 microorganisms were isolated from 84{\%} of HAP episodes. Overall, the most frequently isolated pathogens from HAP episodes were Klebsiella pneumoniae (23{\%}), Escherichia coli (21{\%}), and Staphylococcus aureus (18{\%}). These were mostly multidrug-resistant. The crude mortality was found to be 25{\%}. Conclusion: Surveillance of HAP in non-ICU and nonintubated adult patients provides valuable guidance for empirical antimicrobial therapy and infection control measures for some wards. {\textcopyright} T{\""{U}}BİTAK.",M Avci and O Özgenç and A Coşkuner and B Bozca and K Levent and G Mermut and M S Taşbakan and N Genç and G Güloǧlu and A Ari,1300-0144,Turkish Journal of Medical Sciences,"Escherichia coli,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Staphylococcus aureus,Turkey (republic),adult,antacid agent,antibiotic agent,antibiotic sensitivity,antibiotic therapy,article,bacterium isolation,cardiovascular disease,central nervous system disease,endotracheal intubation,female,histamine H2 receptor antagonist,hospital infection,hospitalization,human,incidence,infection rate,major clinical study,male,malignant neoplastic disease,mortality,multidrug resistance,nasogastric tube,pneumonia,prospective study,risk factor,teaching hospital,ward",357--363,{Hospital-acquired pneumonia in nonintensive care unit wards},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L359133920 http://dx.doi.org/10.3906/sag-0902-14 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=13000144{\&}id=doi:10.3906{\%}2Fsag-0902-14{\&}atitle=Hospital-acquired+pneumoni,40,2010,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,MAYBE,Cale,MAYBE,Ayomide,Ayomide,Zach_4,yes,,

A 78 old male patient was admitted to Clinical Hospital Center Zagreb with subdural haematoma. He was previously diagnosed with acute myeloblastic leukemia. After surgical removal of haematoma he developed purulent meningtis. K. pneumoniae with reduced susceptibility to carbapenems was isolated. The patient died from intracerebral bleeding in April 2011. The antimicrobial susceptibility to a wide range of antibiotics was determined by broth microdilution method in Mueller-Hinton broth and 96 well microtiter plates according to CLSI guidelines. A double-disksynergy test was performed to detect ESBLs. Modified Hodge Test (MHT) was used to screen for production of carbapenemases. MBL E-test was used to screen for production of metallo-b-lactamases. The transferability of meropenem resistance was determined by conjugation (broth mating method) employing E. coli A15R-strain resistant to rifampicin. Transconjugant was selected on the combined plates containing meropenem (1 mg/L) and rifampicin (128 mg/mL). The presence of genes encoding ESBLs (blaSHV, blaTEM, blaCTX-M), plasmid mediated ampC b-lactamases and carbapenemases blaKPC, blaOXA-48, blaOXA-NDM, blaVIM and blaIMP was determined by PCR. Results: The isolate showed resistance or intermediate susceptibility to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins, beta-lactam combinations with inhibitors, carbapenems and gentamicin but remained susceptible only to ciprofloxacin and colistin. Modified Hodge test was consistent with the activity of carbapenemases. The MBL test for metallo-betalactamase was negative indicating the absence of metallo betalactamase. Imipenem resistance was not transferred to E. coli recipient strain by conjugation. PCR revealed the presence of blaKPC, blaTEM genes and blaSHV genes. Sequencing of blaKPC gene revealed the presence of KPC-2 beta-lactamase. Neither plasmidmediated AmpC beta-lactamase nor OXA-48 beta-lactamase were found. The strain was found belong to ST37 clone by MLST. Conclusions: Infection control efforts limited the spread of KPCproducing clone of K. pneumoniae in our hospital so far.

1939,MAYBE,Berger2016,Article,"Background: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the most common cause of nosocomial diarrhoea. C. difficile ribotype 018 (RT018) has become the most prevalent strain in North Italy and has spread to several European countries as well as to East Asia (South Korea and Japan), where a growing number of RT018- related outbreaks have been reported. However, the RT018 strain has rarely been isolated in Central and Western Europe. In August 2015, C. difficile RT018 was detected in two hospitals in the German state of Baden-Wuerttemberg. An outbreak investigation was initiated in close cooperation between the local hospital hygiene team and the National Consultant Laboratory for C. difficile, followed by prospective ribotyping of all isolates for a period of two months. Here, we provide a preliminary report on this first RT018 outbreak in southern Germany. Method: C. difficile strains were detected and characterized using antigen detection, stool culture and PCR. Subsequently, capillary electrophoresis ribotyping and multiple-locus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA) were carried out on all C. difficile RT018 strains to investigate genetic relatedness and possible clonality. Result: In total, nine C. difficile RT018 isolates could be identified. All RT018 strains were genetically related and clustered into two clonal complexes. When compared with historic isolates from Germany and with recent epidemic outbreak isolates from Milan, Italy, the identified isolates showed close relatedness with the epidemic Italian strains from Milan in 3 of 4 cases. In contrast, no direct relationship to the historic German isolates was found. Antibiotic susceptibility testing revealed resistance to moxifloxacin among the Italian and the German outbreak strains, while this resistance pattern was absent in most historic German isolates. Follow-up investigations in the outbreak hospitals elucidated continued low-level spreading of RT018 isolates for a period of at least two months, despite strict application of hand hygiene and infection prevention strategies, including early diagnosis of patients with diarrhoea, single room isolation of patients with symptomatic CDI and contact precautions.

The multi-drug-resistant Vibrio cholerae O1 serotype Ogawa was found to be responsible for this outbreak. On 5 August 2013, a 30-year-old woman presented with severe dehydration and watery diarrhea at the Aganwadi Health Centre in Badami. A total of 49 suspected cholera cases were reported, with an attack rate of 3.5{\%}. The V. cholerae isolates exhibited resistance to a wide range of drugs, including ampicillin, co-trimoxazole, nitrofurantoin, carbenicillin, and third generation cephalosporins, and showed reduced susceptibility to third generation fluoroquinolones. All of the cephalosporin-resistant V. cholerae strains produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamase.

Methods: The isolates were identified to species level by MALDITOF MS. Antibiotic susceptibilities were determined by disk diffusion, VITEK2, and microdilution MIC determination. ESBL, AmpC and carbapenemase were analyzed by PCR-sequencing. Purified plasmids were electroporated in recipient TOP10 E. coli and their InC groups were determined. The isolates were typed by PFGE and MLST. Results: In 2010, 5 NDM-producing isolates (2 E. coli, 1 K. pneumoniae, 1 M. morganii, 1 E. cloacae) were identified in Belgium in 3 patients admitted to different hospitals. Isolates were recovered upon admission from necrotic wound infection, respiratory and fecal samples. One patient died from severe sepsis while two others were colonized. Patients were transferred from Pakistan, Montenegro and Kosovo. Enforced barrier precautions were applied and no secondary nosocomial outbreaks did occur. The E. coli isolates from 2 patients were genetically distinct by PFGE and harbored different MLST sequence types (ST101 and ST782). The K. pneumoniae presented a ST15 type (close to ST14)involved in the spread of CTX-M-15 producing K. pneumoniae. All isolates were extensively resistant and displayed a synergy between imipenem and EDTA. MICs against meropenem/imipenem/doripenem ranged from ≤1 to 8 mg/L while MIC against ertapenem ranged between 4 and 16 mg/L. NDM-1 was borne on 1 IncFI, 1 IncA/C and 1 none typable plasmid. NDM-1 in M. morganii and in E. cloacae could not be transferred in recipient cells suggesting a chromosome location or very high size plasmid. In E. coli TOP10, NDM-1 confers MICs ≤1 mg/L against all carbapenems. In addition, multiple resistance genes were associated with NDM-1 on the same or on different plasmids including CMY-16, CMY- 58, CTX-M-15, SHV-12, TEM-1, OXA-30, OXA-9, RmtB, ArmA, QnrA and QnrB. Conclusion: NDM-1 is rapidly spreading worldwide mostly from the Indian subcontinent. This is the first characterization of NDM-1- producing isolates in Belgium, two being isolated from patients with no link with the Indian subcontinent but who received hospital care in Balkan countries.

Worldwide, systemic infections with BL enzymes are evolving by mutations from classical bla genes in an intensified manner and they continue to be transferred across species. Results: E.cloacae BF1417 isolate and its transconjugants gave positive results with the DDST, suggesting the presence of ESBL. Sequence analysis revealed a bla {\textless}inf{\textgreater}SHV-ESBL{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}-type gene that differs from the gene encoding SHV-1 by five point mutations resulting in three amino acid substitutions in the coding region: C123R, I282T and L286P. This novel SHV-type enzyme was designated SHV-128. The conjugation tests and plasmid characterization showed that the bla {\textless}inf{\textgreater}SHV-128{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} is located on a conjugative plasmid IncFII type. Expression studies demonstrated that the above mutations participated in drug resistance, hydrolysis of extended spectrum $\beta$-lactam and the change of the isoelectric point of the protein.

2611,YES,Brigante2012,Article,"Acinetobacter baumannii is a Gram-negative organism reported worldwide as a cause of health-care-associated infections, particularly in intensive care units (ICUs). The aim of this study is to describe the emergence and spread of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (CRAB) isolates in hospitalized patients. From March to November 2009, multidrug-resistant CRAB isolates were obtained from 21 patients hospitalized in different wards (mostly ICUs). Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by using the Etest method. Carbapenem and aminoglycoside resistance determinants were studied by PCR and sequencing. Genetic relatedness was investigated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multiplex PCR identification of sequence groups. Clinical records of patients were examined retrospectively. CRAB isolates were consistently resistant to multiple drugs including fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides, whereas they retained a susceptibility to colistin. Molecular analysis revealed that 19 of the 21 CRAB isolates belonged to a single clone producing both the carbapenemase OXA-23 and the 16S rRNA methylase ArmA. Based on clinical data, the patients included in the study were classified as infected (n = 13) or colonized (n = 8). Colistin alone or in combination with ampicillin-sulbactam was administered to 11 of the 13 infected patients.

Even if widespread antibiotic therapy and modern imaging technologies combined with minimally invasive techniques have improved the outcome in patients with brain abscesses, this is counterbalanced by an increasing population of immunocompromised patients. Basal ganglia, thalamic, brainstem or multiple abscesses are usually of hematogenous origin with an underlying source of infection which can include congenital heart disease, thoracic sepsis or, less frequently, an odontogenic or otogenic source. However, no evident foci of sepsis or predisposing factors may be found. Only a few studies are reported in the literature, because midline abscesses are usually included in studies dealing on the treatment of abscesses in general. Different treatment options and the timing of treatment are described. We report our experience in 3 consecutive cases of thalamic abscess, treated by stereotactic puncture as the first step, followed by histological analysis, external drainage and targeted intrathecal and systemic antibiotic therapy. Deep-seated abscesses seem to behave differently as they are associated with an increased risk of intraventricular rupture and antibiotic resistance, a fact which justifies a more aggressive and immediate surgical treatment.

3489,MAYBE,Charalambakis2012,Article,"Objectives: Accurate detection of production or co-production of class A KPC and class B metallo -beta-lactamase (MBL) Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolates. Methods: From November 2010 - November 2011, 30 K. pneumoniae ICU blood isolates with reduced susceptibility to carbapenemes (MIC {\textgreater} 1 $\mu$g/mL) were detected. Antibiotic susceptibility to several antibiotics was estimated by Kirby-Bauer method, MIC determination by automated system (Phoenix, BD) and E-test (Biomerieux SA, France), according to CLSI standards. The isolates were submitted to phenotypic combined disk test by both EDTA and boronic acid - meropenem for the differentiation of KPC and MBL enzymes. Genotypic confirmation for the presence of carbapenemase genes was carried out by PCR and molecular typing was performed by PFGE in 11 representative isolates. Results: The clinical isolates were mulltidrug resistant with an MIC range to meropenem ({\textless}1 to ≥2), while colistin (≤0.5-≥4), gentamicin (2-8), tigecycline (≤2-≥8) and fosfomycin (≤16-128) were the most active agents. Twenty isolates produced KPC carbapenemases, seven isolates only VIM while four produced both KPC and VIM carbapenemases. Five isolates produced ESBL additionally. Pulsed field typing gathered five isolates into subtype A1 and one in subtype A2, which is the most common type producing KPC-2 in Greece. Three isolates were included in sybtype B, the second most common type of KPC in Greece which produced both KPC and VIM . Two isolates were not genetically related. Conclusion: Dissemination of bla KPC is mainly due to certain K. pneumoniae types. Fosfomycin, colistin and tigecyclin remain among the therapeutic options for KPC infections. Phenotypic and molecular tests were in accordance for detection of KPC, MBL producers and coproducers in the majority of isolates.

3688,YES,Chen2015o,Article,"AIMS: To describe the identification of two carbapenem-resistant, NDM-1 and IMP-4, carbapenemases coproducing Enterobacteriaceae isolates recovered from hospitalized patients in China. Both Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolates (Kpn922 and Kpn9599) were resistant to meropenem and imipenem and were subjected to additional antibiotic susceptibility testing. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequence analyses were used to characterize bacterial carbapenemase resistance genes, extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, plasmid-mediated AmpC enzymes, quinolone resistance, and 16s RNA methylase. Genetic relatedness was determined using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Plasmids were analyzed by S1-PFGE and Southern blot. RESULTS: PCR analyses revealed that the Kpn922 isolate carried blaNDM-1, blaIMP-4, blaTEM-1, and blaSHV-1 genes, while Kpn9599 carried blaNDM-1, blaIMP-4, blaTEM-1, and blaSHV-12 genes. MLST determined that the two isolates were ST1043 and ST571 sequence types. Southern blot analyses revealed that metallo-beta-lactamase genes were plasmid borne in both isolates. Plasmids approximately 300 kb simultaneously carried blaNDM-1 and blaIMP-4. CONCLUSIONS: Coexistence of blaNDM-1 and blaIMP-4 in these clinical isolates may herald the emergence of a new pattern of drug resistance.

3753,MAYBE,Chia2016,Article,"Background: Carbapenem resistance is an emerging global problem. Resistance to carbapenems arises through either acquisition of resistance genes (IMP, NDM-1, KPC, OXA) or production of extended spectrum beta-lactamase with alteration of porin expression. In Singapore, there has been an increase in CRE since 2010. The primary objective of this retrospective case-case-control study is to identify and compare risk factors for colonization with NCP CRE and CP CRE. Methods {\&} Materials: Patients admitted between September 2010 and July 2013 to Tan Tock Seng Hospital, a teaching hospital in Singapore, were included. We selected three groups of subjects. Case 1: patients who had NCP CRE gut colonization. Case 2: patients who had CP CRE gut colonization. Control: Patients who were screened negative for CRE. Demographic, clinical, microbiological data and antibiotic usage in preceding 90 days were collected from electronic medical records. Statistical analysis was done using STATA 12.0. Results: 1934 patients were screened for CRE, of which a total of 17 patients colonized with NCP CRE and 15 patients with CP CRE (13 NDM-1 and 2 OXA-48) were compared with 60 randomly selected control patients. Of the NCP CRE, 9 were Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1 was Enterobacter cloacae, 1 was Enterobacter aerogenes and 6 were not speciated. Of the CP CRE, 7 were Klebsiella pneumoniae, 4 were Escherichia coli and 4 were Enterobacter cloacae. There was no significant difference in age, sex and Charlson index between cases and controls. Duration of fluoroquinolone and carbapenem exposure was significantly longer for NCP CRE compared to controls: fluoroquinolone-(3.88±6.47 vs 1.00±.80; OR, 1.16; 95{\%} CI, 1.02 - 1.32; P = 0.02) and carbapenems- (5.29±7.70 vs 1.62±5.52; OR, 1.08; 95{\%} CI, 1.00 - 1.17; P = 0.05). Of note, antibiotic exposure in the preceding 90 days was not associated with CP CRE colonization. Conclusion: While preceding antibiotic use was a risk factor for NCP CRE colonization, it was not found to be a risk factor in CP CRE colonization. As such, we will need to continue to evaluate risk factors and infection control strategies for CP CRE.

3798,MAYBE,Chironna2011,Article,"OBJECTIVES: Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a frequent cause of human lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) for which macrolides are the treatment of choice. The aim of this study was to determine the rate of macrolide resistance and to subtype M. pneumoniae strains in Italy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: During an outbreak of M. pneumoniae infections in southern Italy in 2010, 48 clinical specimens from 43 paediatric patients hospitalized for LRTIs were analysed for macrolide resistance. The mutations associated with resistance (A2063G and A2064G) and M. pneumoniae subtypes were detected by sequencing the targeted domain V region of the 23S rRNA gene and a region in the MPN528a gene, respectively. RESULTS: Macrolide resistance genotypes were detected in 11 (26{\%}) of the 43 M. pneumoniae-positive children. The A2063G mutation was identified in seven patients and the A2064G mutation was identified in the remaining four. Upon admission, the isolates from three patients showed a susceptible genotype but subsequently acquired the A2063G mutation. Genotyping revealed M. pneumoniae subtype 1 in 33 of 40 sequenced strains and subtype 2 in the remaining 7. There was no association between macrolide resistance or susceptibility and the M. pneumoniae subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of macrolide resistance among M. pneumoniae strains in Italy. Our findings indicate an unexpected high prevalence of macrolide resistance genotypes in children, and so macrolide resistance should be carefully considered in patients who do not respond appropriately to antibiotic treatment.

3927,YES,Chua2014,Article,"A previously well 66-year-old man was repatriated from Athens, Greece, to the Austin Hospital for ongoing management after a protracted hospital admission for an ischiorectal abscess secondary to perforated diverticulitis. This was complicated by faeculent peritonitis, multiple intra-abdominal abscesses and necrotising fasciitis of the abdominal wall. These complex problems required multiple laparotomies to drain and debride the abscesses, management of an open abdomen with vacuum-assisted closure dressings, and the formation of a loop sigmoidostomy. He also developed a grade IV sacral pressure ulcer with underlying sacral osteomyelitis. Organisms isolated from the intra-abdominal collections included carbapenemresistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and a carbapenemaseproducing Klebsiella pneumoniae (blaKPC). Due to the complexity of the patient's illness, he had spent 93 days in hospital in Greece, predominantly in intensive care, with three interhospital transfers within Greece before repatriation to Australia. Antibiotics administered in Greece included tigecycline, colistin, fosfomycin, vancomycin, clindamycin and anidulafungin. As the patient had multiple resistant organisms, detailed infection control plans were made before his arrival at the Austin Hospital. This included placement in a single room with a dedicated ensuite bathroom, daily bleach cleaning of the room,1 no use of shared equipment, enforcement of strict contact precautions including gowns and gloves, and hand hygiene. Patient movement was severely restricted and only two visitors were allowed at any one time. Unfortunately, the patient developed a new intra-abdominal collection, bowel obstruction and abdominal sepsis. This required surgical intervention, including extensive division of adhesions, resection of the sigmoid and part of the descending colon, retroperitoneal enteric fistula repair and retroperitoneal abscess drainage. An end colostomy and loop ileostomy were formed. This procedure resulted in faecal continence and therefore control of the perianal source of multidrug-resistant organisms. Culture of the intra-abdominal abscess grew mixed enteric flora including Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp, Candida glabrata and K. pneumoniae. The latter organism was resistant to multiple drugs, including meropenem, due to the production of K. pneumoniae carbapenemase-2 (blaKPC-2) (Patient 1, Box). The same organism was found in his faeces. A blaKPC-2-producing K. pneumoniae was also isolated from a sacral ulcer swab, but the susceptibility profile was slightly different. This isolate was also resistant to all aminoglycosides, including gentamicin and amikacin, and demonstrated an increased minimum inhibitory concentration to colistin (Box). The patient's antibiotic treatment included meropenem, tigecycline, colistin and caspofungin for 6 weeks, and his sacral ulcer was treated with a vacuum-assisted closure dressing. He stayed at the Austin Hospital for 101 days before being discharged home. Six months later, the patient re-presented to the Austin Hospital with urosepsis. The causative organism, isolated in both urine and blood, was E. coli (Box). Strikingly, the organism was found to be a blaKPC-2-producing strain, suggesting interspecies transfer of this mobile genetic element between K. pneumoniae and E. coli. Unlike the K. pneumoniae, this isolate was susceptible to ciprofloxacin, and the patient was successfully treated with this antibiotic. During this second admission, the same infection control measures were enforced. At follow-up 6 months later, the patient remained well. There was no documented inhospital transmission of blaKPC-2, suggesting the infection control measures employed were successful.",K Y L Chua and M {Lindsay Grayson} and A N Burgess and J Y H Lee and B P Howden,"0025-729X

4187,MAYBE,Consales2011,Article,"Purpose: Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MRAB) is an emerging cause of intensive care unit (ICU) outbreaks. Patients are the main reservoirs, inducing cross transmission. We describe an MRAB outbreak that occurred in the Prato Hospital ICU in June to August 2009. Materials and Methods: The ICU consists of 2 separated 4-bed rooms (rooms A and B). The MRAB-positive patients were included in our study. During the outbreak, infection control measures were enhanced; patients and environmental screenings were performed. A 6-month follow-up was carried out. Results: Four of 26 patients admitted during the outbreak were MRAB positive. All patients were located in room A; no case was detected in room B either in the hospital or during the follow-up. Management included closure to new admissions, reinforcement of infection control measures, patient and environmental screenings, discharge of room B MRAB-negative patients for at least 5 days after the first case identification. All isolates were carbapenems resistant and tigecycline and colistin susceptible. All patients received tigecycline: 2 were successfully treated, 1 died because of preexisting illness, and 1 developed resistance and recovered after colistin therapy. Conclusions: Enhanced infection control measures and adequate antibiotic strategy limited the outbreak. Tigecycline allowed rapid recovery. Nevertheless, resistance ensued; so colistin remained the only therapeutic option. However, pan-drug resistance has been reported. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.",G Consales and E Gramigni and L Zamidei and D Bettocchi and A R {De Gaudio},"0883-9441

This study reports the emergence of carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae strains in Brescia Civic Hospital, Italy. Different samples, collected from April 2012 to February 2013, showed that 29 patients presented infections from multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae and three of these patients were intestinal carriers. In total, 40 carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae strains were isolated from multiple specimens of these patients. In 39 out of 40 samples, we identified the blaKPC-3 carbapenemase gene variant responsible for bacterial carbapenem resistance. The DiversiLab analysis showed four different genetic patterns within multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates, with pattern 1 and 2 including 95{\%} of the bacterial strains. Carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae strains belonging to patterns 1 and 2 were also detected in the intestinal tract of the three asymptomatic carriers. Moreover, isolation of the same strains in other body sites of the same patients and in bronchial fluid of a non-colonized patient in the same ward indicates an initial dissemination of this pathogen. Our results highlight the emergence of carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae strains in different hospital wards and the urgent need for infection control, antibiotic stewardship programmes and utilization of a surveillance and prevention system.",S Corbellini and F Caccuri and M Gelmi and M A {De Francesco} and S Fiorentini and A Caruso and C Giagulli,"1121-7138 (Print)

A 58 year-old man was admitted to the Saint Joseph Hospital-Raymond and Aida Najjar polyclinic in Beirut on July 17, 2007 to undergo surgery for a moderately differentiated colonic adenocarcinoma (T3N0). Following several discharges and re-admissions, an extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Escherichia coli susceptible to imipenem was isolated. The patient was put on imipenem and metronidazole. Three weeks later, imipenem (IMP) resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae was isolated. Methods and results. The antimicrobial susceptibility profile of the imipenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae strain and related minimum inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics were determined. Hydrolysis of IMP was evaluated and production of metallo-$\beta$-lactamase (MBL) was detected by a double disk-synergy test, ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) inhibited the imipenemase activity, whereas clavulanate and tazobaetam did not, this suggesting the production of a metallo-$\beta$-lactamase. Isoelectric focusing analysis was performed and indicated the presence of a cefotaximase (blaCTX-M-15). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used and detected the presence of blaIMP-1 and blaCTX-M genes. Conclusions.

4717,YES,David2008,Article,"AIM OF THE STUDY: This retrospective study was conducted in order to characterize mechanisms of resistance to beta-lactams and clonality of 24 isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These strains were isolated from patients hospitalized in Rouen University Hospital between August 2004 and December 2006 and were resistant to cefepime and/or ceftazidime (PMR) by a mechanism not only related to overproduction of the cephalosporinase. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical strains of PMR were characterized by conventional biochemical methods, antibiotic susceptibility testing by disk diffusion in agar with or without cloxacillin and RAPD for genetic comparison. Identification of beta-lactamase was performed by PCR amplification followed by sequencing of bla genes. RESULTS: All strains produced the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) TEM-116. Epidemiological study identified eight unrelated strains, eight related strains originating from a single unit, three related strains isolated in different wards and five related strains coproducing TEM-116 and SHV-2a but isolated in different units. Detection of ESBL in these strains was difficult due to a low level of ESBL production. CONCLUSION: This is the first report of TEM-116 in France in 24 strains of P. aeruginosa and its association with SHV-2a in five cases. SHV-2a has been described in P. aeruginosa in France but not TEM-116 which was recently reported in this species, in China and in Netherlands (in a strain coproducing SHV-12).

The first South African NDM-1 case was reported in September 2011. We describe a case-control study of an NDM-1 producing Enterobacteriaceae outbreak which occurred in a 322- bed South African hospital and identify risk factors associated with invasive disease and mortality. Methods {\&} Materials: All reported NDM-1 positive patients (n = 97) identified between 1 June 2011 and 31 October 2012 were reviewed. The inclusion criteria was all patients admitted during the study period in whom NDM-1 producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates causing invasive disease were identified at least 48 hours after admission (n = 41). Controls (n = 78) were randomly selected and matched for age, sex, date of hospital admission, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Bivariate conditional logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for NDM-1 invasive disease as well as death. A forward multivariate conditional logistic regression model was utilised to identify significant predictors for NDM-1 invasive disease and death. Results: The epidemic-curve showed a propagating pattern, with most cases being detected during or subsequent to ICU admission. Cases had longer mean hospital (27.8 days vs 11.9 days) and ICU stays (31.0 days vs 7.3 days) than controls. The crude in-hospital mortality of cases was significantly higher than controls (OR 13.02; 95{\%} CI: 2.98 - 56.76). The final model showed co-morbid disease (Charlson Score) (AOR 1.68; 95{\%} CI: 1.21 - 2.33); mechanical ventilation (AOR 1.35;95{\%}CI: 1.02 - 1.16) and receipt of piperacillin-tazobactam (AOR 1.33; 95{\%} CI: 1.11 - 1.61) to be significant predictors for invasive disease. Invasive disease was strongly associated with mortality (AOR 9.62; 95{\%} CI: 2.16 - 42.93). Conclusion: NDM-1 invasive disease is associated with significant mortality.

5416,YES,Dora2008,Article,"Introduction: Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumanii are important nosocomial pathogens with wide intrinsic resistance. However, due to the dissemination of the acquired resistance mechanisms, such as extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) and metallo beta-lactamase (MBL) production, multidrug resistant strains have been isolated more often. Case presentation: We report a case of a Hungarian tourist, who was initially hospitalized in Egypt and later transferred to Hungary. On the day of admission PER-1-producing P. aeruginosa, PER-1 producing A. baumannii, SHV-5-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae and VIM-2-producing P. aeruginosa isolates were subcultured from the patient's samples in Hungary. Comparing the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns of the P. aeruginosa strains from the patient to the P. aeruginosa strains occurring in this hospital, we can state that the PER-1-producing P. aeruginosa and VIM-2-producing P. aeruginosa had external origin. Conclusion: This is the first report of PER-1-producing P. aeruginosa, and PER-1-producing A. baumanii strains in Hungary. This case highlights the importance of spreading of the beta-lactamase-mediated resistance mechanisms between countries and continents, showing the importance of careful screening and the isolation of patients arriving from a different country. {\textcopyright} 2008 Szab{\'{o}} et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",S Dora and J Szentandrássy and Z Juhász and K Katona and K Nagy and L Rókusz,1476-0711,Annals of Clinical Microbiology and Antimicrobials,"Acinetobacter baumannii,Egypt,Enterococcus faecalis,Hungary,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Pseudomonas aeruginosa,Pseudomonas extended resistance 1 protein,adult,amikacin,aminoglycoside,antibiotic resistance,antibiotic sensitivity,article,aztreonam,bacterial strain,bacterium culture,bacterium detection,bacterium isolate,beta lactamase SHV,beta lactamase SHV 5,burn,carbapenem,case report,cefepime,cefotaxime,ceftazidime,ceftriaxone,cephalosporin,ciprofloxacin,clavulanic acid,edetic acid,extended spectrum beta lactamase,gentamicin,human,imipenem,male,meropenem,metallo beta lactamase,methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus,minimum inhibitory concentration,netilmicin,nonhuman,piperacillin plus tazobactam,protein VIM 2,pulsed field gel electrophoresis,sepsis,tobramycin,vancomycin",NA,"{Imported PER-1 producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa, PER-1 producing Acinetobacter baumanii and VIM-2-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains in Hungary}",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L351877807 http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1476-0711-7-12 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=14760711{\&}id=doi:10.1186{\%}2F1476-0711-7-12{\&}atitle=Imported+PER-1+produ,7,2008,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,YES,Brooke,YES,Erica,Erica,Zach_4,yes,,
5718,YES,Ehrmann2016,Article,"INTRODUCTION: Capnocytophaga genus was recently known to highly contribute to the beta-lactam (BL) and macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (MLS) resistance gene reservoir in the oral microbiota (BL: blaCSP-1 and blaCfxA; MLS: erm(F) and erm(C)). But fluoroquinolone (FQ) resistance remains uncommon in literature, without available data on resistance mechanisms. CASE REPORT: For the first time, a case of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was described in a 78-year-old immunocompetent patient due to a multidrug-resistant Capnocytophaga gingivalis isolate with significant microbiological finding. C.gingivalis acquired resistance to third generation cephalosporins (blaCfxA3 gene), MLS (erm(F) gene), and fluoroquinolones. Genetics of the resistance, unknown as regards fluoroquinolone, was investigated and a substitution in QRDR of GyrA was described (Gly80Asn substitution) for the first time in the Capnocytophaga genus. LITERATURE REVIEW: A comprehensive literature review of Capnocytophaga spp. extra-oral infection was conducted. Including the present report, on 43 cases, 7 isolates were BL-resistant (17{\%}), 4 isolates were MLS-resistant (9.5{\%}) and 4 isolates were FQ-resistant (9.5{\%}). The studied clinical isolate of C.gingivalis was the only one to combine resistance to the three groups of antibiotics BL, MLS and FQ. Four cases of Capnocytophaga lung infection were reported, including three infections involving C. gingivalis (two FQ resistant) and one involving C. sputigena. CONCLUSION: This multidrug-resistant C. gingivalis isolate illustrated the role of oral flora as a reservoir of antibiotic resistance and its contribution to the limitation of effective antibiotics in severe respiratory infections.",E Ehrmann and A Jolivet-Gougeon and M Bonnaure-Mallet and T Fosse,1075-9964,Anaerobe,",Aged,Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology,Antibiotic resistance,Bacterial/*genetics,Capnocytophaga gingivalis,Capnocytophaga/drug effects/*genetics/isolation {\&},Cephalosporins/pharmacology,Chronic Obstructive/*diagnosis/,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,DNA Gyrase/*genetics,Drug Resistance,Fluoroquinolone,Fluoroquinolones/pharmacology,Gene Expression,Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections/*diagnosis/micr,Humans,Lincosamides/pharmacology,Macrolides/pharmacology,Male,Multiple,Mutation,Oral microbiota,Pulmonary Disease,Streptogramins/pharmacology,aged,amino acid substitution,antibiotic resistance,antibiotic sensitivity,antibiotic therapy,bacterial gene,blaCfxA3 gene,case report,cephalosporin derivative,chronic obstructive lung disease,disease exacerbation,erm(F) gene,human,immunocompromised patient,lung infection,male,multidrug resistance,nonhuman,priority journal,quinoline derived antiinfective agent,review,streptogramin derivative",50--54,{Multidrug-resistant oral Capnocytophaga gingivalis responsible for an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Case report and literature review},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L611720521 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anaerobe.2016.08.003 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=10958274{\&}id=doi:10.1016{\%}2Fj.anaerobe.2016.08.003{\&}atitle=Mult,42,2016,NA,"From Duplicate 1 (Multidrug-resistant oral Capnocytophaga gingivalis responsible for an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Case report and literature review - Ehrmann, E; Jolivet-Gougeon, A; Bonnaure-Mallet, M; Fosse, T)

6591,MAYBE,Fouad2013,Article,"BACKGROUND: Healthcare-associated infections are a worldwide threat to hospitalized patients, especially those in intensive care units. The prevalence of these infections in Egypt, and their antimicrobial resistance patterns and mechanisms, were investigated in this study. METHODS: A total of 547 cases of healthcare-associated infections were investigated. Causative agents were identified and antimicrobial susceptibility determined. Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii isolates were further investigated for their resistance mechanism via the modified Hodge test, inhibitor-potentiated disk diffusion test, synergy with carbonyl cyanide chlorophenylhydrazone, and PCR. Moreover, clonal linkage was examined via enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC)-PCR. RESULTS: Klebsiella spp was the most prevalent species in the isolates examined (217; 40{\%}). Although A. baumannii represented only 10{\%} of the total isolates, it showed the highest percentage of carbapenem resistance (74{\%}). PCR showed that 100{\%} of the resistant isolates carried both blaOXA-51 and blaOXA-23 genes, 85{\%} carried the class 1 integrase genes, and only 2.5{\%} carried metallo-beta-lactamase (blaVIM). ERIC-PCR indicated that isolates from different hospitals were genetically linked. CONCLUSIONS: These findings represent the first report of the alarming spread of OXA-23 carbapenemase in A. baumannii in Egyptian intensive care units. The spread of such strains has serious health consequences and requires the application of strict infection control measures.",M Fouad and A S Attia and W M Tawakkol and A M Hashem,"1201-9712

6806,YES,Gabriel2015,Article,"Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis), one of the leading etiological agents of nosocomial infections poses a significant economic burden globally. Introduced in 2000, linezolid (LZD) has become an important antibiotic, used in nearly seventy countries worldwide to treat infections caused by Gram-positive pathogens such as meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species along with vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Resistance to LZD in clinical settings remains rare. Here, we report the emergence of meticillin resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE) clinical isolates from two voluntary general acute hospitals exhibiting higher than typically reported levels of LZD resistance (MIC{\textgreater}256 mug/ml).

We describe the first isolates of mecC-positive MRSA of human origin collected in Spain and report a fatal case of bacteraemia. METHODS: Isolates were tested for phenotypic resistance using cefoxitin, tested for the mecA/mecC genes and toxin genes by PCR, and typed by staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec), PFGE, spa, multilocus sequence typing and agr. RESULTS: During 2008-13 five MRSA isolates showing resistance to cefoxitin and carrying the mecC gene were recovered at one hospital in Spain. In a review of 5505 S. aureus strains received at the Spanish National Reference Centre for Staphylococci from the same period, we found two additional mecC-positive isolates. The isolates were recovered from blood (two), wounds (two), joint fluid (one), urine (one) and a nasal swab (one). All MRSA were mecA negative, presented SCCmecXI, belonged to agr group III and to clonal complex 130, and were negative for the production of the toxin genes tst1, eta, etb, etd and Panton-Valentine leucocidin. Six isolates belonged to spa type t843 (ST130 and ST1945, where ST stands for sequence type) and one to spa type t6220 (ST1945). One patient with mecC-positive MRSA sepsis died in the emergency department.

7970,MAYBE,Gupta2009f,Article,"BACKGROUND {\&} OBJECTIVE: Enteric fever is a major public health problem in India. It is classically caused by Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi. Salmonella enterica serotype Paratyphi A which had been reported less frequently from cases of enteric fever has shown an increasing trend since 1996 in India. There is also variation in the antimicrobial susceptibility of Salmonella Paratyphi A from different parts of the country. An attempt is therefore made to study the rate of isolation and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of Salmonella Paratyphi A from cases of enteric fever coming to a tertiary care hospital at Chandigarh. METHODS: The blood samples of patients suspected of having enteric fever and admitted to Government Medical College and Hospital, Chandigarh, from January 2006 to April 2007 (11,240) were processed by conventional methods. Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. The minimum inhibitory concentration to two antibiotics- ciprofloxacin and chloramphenicol was determined by agar dilution technique. Simultaneously, retrospective analysis was done from January 2003-December 2005 to study any difference in the incidence and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of Salmonella Paratyphi A among enteric fever patients. RESULTS: Of 305 total isolates, 231 were S. Typhi and 84 S. Paratyphi A rise. The number of Salmonella Paratyphi A cases rose from 27 in 2006 (34.18{\%}) to 13 (40.63{\%}) in four months of 2007. All were sensitive to ciprofloxacin and cefotaxime but MIC to ciprofloxacin was raised (0.125-0.5 microg/ml). Resistance to nalidixic acid was 92.5 per cent. Chloramphenicol sensitivity re-emerged with 90 per cent isolates sensitive to it while sensitivity to ampicillin dropped (72.5{\%}) as compared to previous years. Only one isolate was multi-drug resistant. INTERPRETATION {\&} CONCLUSION: The present study conferencing Salmonella Paratyphi A as the rapidly emerging pathogen of enteric fever. With increasing resistance to fluoroquinolones and possibility of re-emergence of sensitivity to chloramphenicol, the policy of empirical treatment of enteric fever needs to be rationalized.",V Gupta and J Kaur and J Chander,"0971-5916 (Print)

Studying annual trends in antibiotic susceptibility and genetic patterns of H. influenzae beta-lactam resistance, we isolated 122 strains from the adult respiratory tract in 2007, determined MIC for different antibiotics, and analyzed TEM-1 beta-lactamase resistant genes and ftsI encoding PBP3 mutation compared to results in 2005 and 2007. We found that ABPC-susceptible strains with MIC {\textless}1 microg/mL (BLNAS) accounted for 71.0{\%}, ABPC-resistant strains with MIC exceeding 2 microg/mL without beta-lactamase activity (BLNAR) for 25.3{\%}, and beta-lactamase-positive strains (BLP) for 3.7{\%}. The BLNAS ratio showed no significant change from 2002 and 2005. The BLP ratio decreased from those in 2002 and 2005. Genetic studies of resistant genes showed that gBLNAS with no resistant genes had increased in the last five years. The ratio of all strains with PBP3 mutation (gBLNAR and gLow-BLNAR) remained constant from 2002 to 2007. The proportion of gBLNAR with two PBP3 mutations had increased, however, while gLow-BLNAR with one mutation had decreased. LVFX showed constant strong antimicrobial potency for all mutation groups. Among beta-lactam antibiotics, the lowest MIC90 was observed in parenteral CTRX and oral CDTR-PI use. Although a new MIC peak generated by gBLNAR became obvious in the ABPC and CDTR-PI MIC distribution, the MIC of the new peak was still low enough to treat with high doses of those two antibiotics.",E Hagiwara and Y Watanuki and J Shiihara and A Matsushima and T Enomoto and A Sekine and N Tsuchiya and T Baba and T Shinohara and T Endo and Y Sogo and R Nishihira and S Komatsu and T Kato and T Ogura and H Takahashi,"0387-5911 (Print)

8949,YES,Hrabak2011,Article,"Objectives: The occurrence of carbapenemase producing Gram-negative bacteria is of high clinical interest as they can hydrolyze most $\beta$-lactam agents including carbapenems recognised as antibiotics of choice in ESBL or acquired AmpC producers usually resistant to other antibiotics. The resistance to carbapenems, generally very rare in Klebsiella pneumoniae strains in the Czech Republic, is predominantly caused by an alteration of the cell wall, together with a production of extendedspectrum and/or AmpC $\beta$-lactamases. At the end of 2009, the first putative KPC-producing isolates of K. pneumoniae was submitted for confirmation to the National Reference Laboratory for Antibiotics of the National Institute of Public Health in Prague. The isolates were obtained from one patient. Methods: MICs of 24 antibiotics were determined according to EUCAST recommendation. $\beta$-lactamases were identified by isoelectric focusing followed by PCR and sequencing of $\beta$-lactamase genes. The gene environment of blaKPC-2 was determined by PCR mapping and sequencing of the amplicons. Isolates were compared by PFGE after the restriction with XbaI endonuclease and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Results: The isolates of K. pneumoniae (ST258) were obtained from a wound swab, decubitus and urine from patient formerly hospitalized in a Greek hospital. The carbapenemase was identified as a KPC-2 with a gene located on Tn4401a traspozon variant.

Levofloxacin non-susceptible S. pneumoniae isolates were subsequently analysed for serotype and molecular epidemiology. Rates of levofloxacin non-susceptibility of S. pneumoniae increased significantly from 1.2{\%} in 2001 to 4.2{\%} in 2007 at NTUH. A total of 30 isolates of levofloxacin non-susceptible S. pneumoniae isolates (MIC {\textgreater}/= 4 mg/L) were available for evaluation of serotype, antimicrobial susceptibility, nucleotide sequence of the quinolone resistance-determining regions of parC, gyrA, parE and gyrB, reserpine effect on quinolone susceptibility and multilocus sequence type. Among these isolates, seven (23.3{\%}) were from children, and two (6.7{\%}; one from a 3- and one from a 93-year-old patient) were from blood. One levofloxacin-resistant isolate (MIC = 8 mg/L) was recovered from a previously healthy child with bacteraemic necrotizing pneumonia complicated by empyema and a haemolytic-uraemic syndrome.

We describe here the evolution of the epidemiology of decreased carbapenem susceptibility in Enterobacteriaceae and the increasing frequency of occurrence of CPE clinical isolates in Belgium. Methods: Multidrug-resistant clinical Enterobacteriaceae isolated referred between Jan. 2007 and Dec. 2010 by Belgian laboratories to the National Reference Centre were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility by disk diffusion method according to CLSI guidelines. Isolates showing decreased susceptibility to a carbapenem (meropenem inhibition diameter {\textless}22 mm) were tested for the presence of carbapenemase encoding genes by PCR targeting blaVIM, IMP, KPC, NDM and blaOXA-48. Case data were reviewed in CPE carriers for evidence of recent travel or transfer from institution abroad. Results: The number of Enterobacteriaceae isolates with decreased susceptibility to a carbapenem increased from 8 (5{\%} of all yearly referred Enterobacteriaceae isolates), 11 (11{\%}) and 14 (11{\%}) in 2007, 2008 and 2009 respectively to 44 (47{\%}) in year 2010. Of the 506 Enterobacteriaceae isolates received over the whole study period, 31 CPE isolates were detected in 27 patients from 12 hospitals, carrying VIM-1 (n = 15), NDM-1 (n = 5), KPC-2 (n = 5)and OXA-48 (n = 6) enzymes. The majority (17/31) of the CPE isolates (including all 5 NDM-1 and 5 of 6 OXA-48 producing isolates) were recorded in 2010. K. pneumoniae represented 65{\%} (20/31) of CPE whereas all but one CPE isolates belonging to 6 other species were reported in 2010. Among the 27 patients carrying CPE, 13 had travelled and had been hospitalized in a foreign country during the three months before diagnosis, 6 had acquired CPE through probable secondary nosocomial transmission, while for 8 carriers, no clear link to imported or epidemic strains could be established. Conclusion: Enterobacteriaceae isolates with decreased susceptibility to carbapenems are increasingly reported and CPE are clearly more frequently detected in Belgium since 2010.

9489,YES,Jacquier2012,Article,"Objectives: Many alleles of the penicillinase TEM-1 or TEM-2 were described so far in clinical isolates. Their spectrum of resistance varies with regard to point mutations in the bla sequence, with some mutations leading to extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) and others to inhibitor-resistant TEM (IRT). These IRT enzymes can broaden their spectrum to third generation cephalosporins by the occurrence of additional mutations: they are commonly referred to as “complex mutant TEM” or CMT. If many studies have shown that modifications of the spectrum of TEM-type enzymes is driven by antibiotic selection pressure, no study has ever described a CMT derived from an IRT by in vivo selection. Methods: We describe the case of a patient hospitalized for an acute myeloid leukemia in the Haematology ward at Saint-Louis Universitary Hospital in Paris. During hospitalisation, the patient was treated with ceftazidime for a bacteremia due to an Escherichia coli strain expressing an IRT phenotype (strain EC1). After 8 days of treatment, there was no clinical improvement and new blood cultures yielded a strain of E. coli with an IRT phenotype but with resistance extended to ceftazidime (strain EC2). Results: ERIC-PCR analysis showed the clonality of the two strains. PCR-sequencing of the TEM allele from EC1 identified the mutations M69L and N276D, corresponding to the TEM-35 allele also known as IRT-4. TEM gene sequencing from EC2 identified the additional mutation R164S, which was previously reported for the TEM-158 allele already described as a CMT allele (CMT-9).

This study examined current pattern of antimicrobial susceptibility among Salmonella enterica isolates from enteric fever cases at a tertiary care centre in New Delhi, India. METHODOLOGY: Blood cultures from patients with enteric fever during January 2010- July 2012 were processed using the BACTEC automated system. Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested using Kirby Bauer's disc diffusion method and/or Phoenix 100 automated system. RESULTS: Of 344 isolates of Salmonella enterica, 266 (77.3{\%}) were S. Typhi, 77 (22.4{\%}) were S. Paratyphi A, and one (0.3{\%}) was S. Paratyphi B. Resistance to nalidixic acid (NA(R)) (96.7{\%}) was most common, followed by ciprofloxacin (37.9{\%}), and azithromycin (7.3{\%}). Multi-drug resistance was observed only in S. Typhi (3.4{\%}). Among NA(R) strains, 61.8{\%} were sensitive, 11.1{\%} were moderately sensitive, and 23.9{\%} were resistant to ciprofloxacin (0.8{\%}, 57.4{\%}, and 37.9{\%} respectively according to revised CLSI breakpoint criteria for ciprofloxacin). Resistance to third-generation cephalosporin was found in seven (2{\%}) strains of S. enterica. CONCLUSION: Increasing rates of nalidixic acid, fluoroquinolone and azithromycin resistance among S. enterica, particularly in S. Paratyphi A strains, is of concern, as S. Paratyphi A infection is becoming increasingly common and is not prevented by current vaccinations.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE 2: Recognize the importance of differentiating N. pseudobrasiliensis from N. brasiliensis and choosing appropriate antimicrobials. CASE: A 79 year old Caucasian male was admitted with multiple abscesses in the lower extremities. Patient had a history of left hand abscess for the past 1 year. Lower extremity abscesses started 6 months ago and were progressively getting worse with increasing pain. He received several courses of antibiotics with moderate relief. His past medical history was significant for Myasthenia Gravis, on prednisone therapy for the last 2 years. Vital signs were stable. On examination, patient had multiple tender swellings in the both lower extremities. Laboratory data was significant only for leucocytosis. Patient was started empirically on vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lower extremities showed multifocal complex lesions and fluid within the muscle bed without any evidence of osteomyelitis. Largest lesion measured approximately 10×8 cm in the left biceps femoris muscle complex. Ultrasound guided drainage of large abscesses was done. The organism was identified presumptively as Actinomyces based on gram stain and colonial morphology. Vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam were discontinued and he was then started on ampicillin. Cultures later revealed the organism to be Nocardia. Genetic analyzer confirmed the species as Nocardia pseudobrasiliensis which was resistant to penicillin, cephalosporins, trimethoprime-sulfomethoxazole and sensitive to moxifloxacin and linezolid. CT chest and MRI brain did not show any disseminated abscesses. Patient was started on moxifloxacin and remarkable improvement was noted. DISCUSSION: Nocardia pseudobrasiliensis is an emerging species of Nocardia, first identified in 1996. Only few cases have been reported so far. This case emphasizes the difficulties in diagnosing Nocardia infection which may lead to inappropriate antimicrobial therapy. The distinction between Actinomyces and Nocardia species is of extreme clinical importance. On gram stain, Nocardia and Actinomyces species are morphologically indistinguishable. Nocardia species can be identified by modified acid-fast staining and their ability to grow under aerobic conditions, neither of which is a characteristic of Actinomyces. Nocardia infections range from localized cutaneous infections to invasive and disseminated disease. Nocardia brasiliensis is one of the most common species isolated in Nocardiosis. A recent study demonstrated that 60 {\%} of apparent N. brasiliensis associated with pulmonary or disseminated disease, belonged to a new taxonomy named N. pseudobrasiliensis. Because of these associations and a different susceptibility pattern, it is prudent to recommend screening of all N. brasiliensis isolates to rule out possible N. pseudobrasiliensis. Disk-diffusion method for ciprofloxacin susceptibility provides a rapid screening test, as 95 {\%} of N. pseudobrasiliensis strains are susceptible compared with none of N. brasiliensis strains. In a study of 43 cases of N. pseudobrasiliensis, 70 {\%} involved the lung, 23 {\%} involved the CNS, and 37 {\%} had disseminated disease. The majority of patients were receiving corticosteroids (74 {\%}) or had AIDS (14 {\%}). Isolates of N. pseudobrasiliensis, unlike isolates of N. brasiliensis, are strongly associated with invasive disease.",V V Kandasamy and A Kaja and K M Abouelezz and M Tadros,0884-8734,Journal of General Internal Medicine,"Actinomyces,Caucasian,Gram staining,Nocardia,Nocardia brasiliensis,abscess,acid,acquired immune deficiency syndrome,ampicillin,antibiotic agent,antiinfective agent,antimicrobial therapy,biceps brachii muscle,brain,central nervous system,cephalosporin derivative,ciprofloxacin,corticosteroid,disk diffusion,examination,genetic analyzer,hand,human,immunocompromised patient,infection,internal medicine,laboratory,leg,leukocytosis,linezolid,liquid,lung,male,medical history,morphology,moxifloxacin,muscle,myasthenia gravis,nocardiosis,nuclear magnetic resonance imaging,organisms,osteomyelitis,pain,pathogenesis,patient,penicillin derivative,piperacillin plus tazobactam,prednisone,screening,screening test,skin infection,society,species,staining,sulfamethoxazole,swelling,taxonomy,therapy,thorax,trimethoprim,ultrasound,vancomycin,vital sign",S265--S266,{A case of multidrug resistant nocardia pseudobrasiliensis},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L71293217 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=08848734{\&}id=doi:{\&}atitle=A+case+of+multidrug+resistant+nocardia+pseudobrasiliensis{\&}stitle=J.+Gen.+Intern.+Med.{\&},28,2013,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,MAYBE,Brooke,MAYBE,Erica,Erica,Zach_4,no,could not find full-text,

We describe the first outbreak of colonisation with KPC-KP strain ST512; it affected nine patients in a 137-bed primary care hospital. The index case was detected by chance when a non-prescribed urine culture was taken from an asymptomatic patient with suprapubic urinary catheter in June 2013. Thereafter, all patients on the 38-bed ward were screened until two screening rounds were negative and extensive control measures were performed. Eight additional KPC-KP-carriers were found, and the highest prevalence of carriers on the ward was nine of 38. All other patients hospitalised on the outbreak ward between 1 May and 10 June and 101 former roommates of KPC-KP carriers since January had negative screening results. Two screening rounds on the hospital's other wards were negative. No link to travel abroad was detected. Compared with non-carriers, but without statistical significance, KPC-KP carriers were older (83 vs 76 years) and had more often received antimicrobial treatment within the three months before screening (9/9 vs 90/133).

10569,MAYBE,Kiernan2009,Article,"PURPOSE: To report a case of daily wear soft contact lens-associated keratitis caused by Alcaligenes xylosoxidans in a portable toilet sanitation worker. METHODS: A previously healthy 30-year-old man presented with bilateral decreased vision, redness, and irritation, beginning 1 week earlier. The patient had been treated with moxifloxocin for 1 week before presentation without improvement. Bacterial staining cultures were performed from corneal scrapings, contact lenses, contact lens case, and solution. Preliminary culture results and antibiotic sensitivities were generated using an automated identification system. Positive results from the contact lens, case, and solution were confirmed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: The contact lenses, contact lens case, and solution cultures revealed heavy growth of A. xylosoxidans. These findings were confirmed by PCR. The organism was found to be resistant to aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, and cephalosporins. The patient was started on polymyxin B or trimethoprim. After 21 days of treatment, the infection completely resolved with a final spectacle-corrected visual acuity of 20/25. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first case report of a corneal infection caused by A. xylosoxidans, which was isolated and identified from a contact lens, case, and solution using culture and PCR technique as well the first description of ocular surface disease resolution after the treatment with topical polymyxin B or trimethoprim.

10691,YES,Kimura2016,Article,"Background: Numbers of patients with diabetic gangrene is increasing. Antimicrobial treatment is commonly used, however, limb amputation cannot be avoided in severe cases. For prophylaxis at operation, basic antimicrobial agents such as cefazolin are often administrated, however, severe infection could occur if resistant strains were cultured especially in immunosuppressive patients such as diabetes. The purpose of this study is to clarify bacterial species and their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents for patients of diabetic foot gangrene. Methods{\&}Materials: Twenty-four patients (nine females)who had amputation on their legs for treating diabetic gangrene were enrolled from year 2002 to 2012. Among them, fifteen patients had diabetic history for over ten years, eleven patients were having repetitive hemodialysis. Their ages were 40-81(mean 67), average hospitalization period were 81.6 days. Results: As results, fifty-seven strains were isolated. Among them, 62{\%} strains were Gram-positive cocci, 33{\%} were Gramnegative rods, 5{\%} were Gram-positive rods. Two or more strains were detected in fifteen patients. Indigenous bacteria of skin such as MSSA were most commonly cultured (n = 10). MRSA was found only in one patient. Sixty-seven percent of Peptostreptococci (n = 7), and seventy-five percent of E.coli (n = 4) were resistant to new quinolones. All Enterococci (n = 6) were susceptible to penicillin. Seventy percent of operated patients had no complications and discharged normally. Others had re-operation, including two cases dead due to heart disease. Most commonly used antimicrobial agents for prophylaxis were cefazolin (n = 8). However, sixty percent of all operated cases had resistant bacterial strain against cefazolin. Conclusion: We conclude that in order to avoid inappropriate anti-microbial therapy, it is important to confirm antimicrobial susceptibility with bacterial culture before operation.

The prevalence of ESBL-producing E. coli and ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae, patient demographics and the susceptibilities of these bacteria to various antimicrobial agents were described. A total of 87.3{\%} of isolates carried several bla genes. The prevalence of bla(CTX-M) was strikingly high: 99.6{\%} for ESBL-producing E. coli (CTX-M-14, -15, -27, -40, and -55) and 99.2{\%} for ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae (CTX-M-3, -14, -15, -27, and -55). ISEcp1 was found in the upstream region of bla(CTX-M) in most isolates. Up to 77.0{\%} and 71.7{\%} of ESBL-producing E. coli and ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae, respectively, carried bla(TEM); all of them encoded TEM-1.

A total of 217 MDR P. aeruginosa isolates were obtained from August 2009 to April 2010 from patients at 144 hospitals in Japan, of which 145 (66.8{\%}) were positive for IMP-type MBLs and AAC(6')-Iae when tested with an immunochromatographic assay. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) showed that these isolates were also positive for blaIMP and aac(6')-Iae genes. When these IMP-type MBL- and AAC(6')-Iae-producing isolates were analysed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), two clusters (I and II) were detected. Most of the isolates (88.3{\%}; 128/145) were grouped under cluster I and had multilocus sequence type ST235 and serotype O11, except for one isolate that was ST991 and serotype O3. The isolates were mainly isolated from the urinary tract (82/145; 56.6{\%}) and respiratory tract (58/145; 40.0{\%}). The epidemiological properties of the isolates belonging to cluster I were similar to those of MDR P. aeruginosa isolates that have been previously reported in Japan.

11023,YES,Kothary2013,Article,"Escherichia coli is implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Rifaximin, a nonabsorbable derivative of rifampin effective against E. coli, improves symptoms in mild-to-moderate IBD. However, rifaximin resistance can develop in a single step in vitro. We examined the prevalence and mechanisms of rifaximin resistance in 62 strains of E. coli isolated from the ileal mucosa of 50 patients (19 with ileal Crohn's disease [L1+L3], 6 with colonic Crohn's disease [L2], 13 with ulcerative colitis [UC], 4 with symptomatic non-IBD diagnoses [NI], and 8 healthy [H]). Resistance (MIC {\textgreater} 1,024 mg/liter) was present in 12/48 IBD-associated ileal E. coli strains. Resistance correlated with prior rifaximin treatment (P {\textless} 0.00000001) but not with the presence of ileal inflammation (P = 0.73) or E. coli phylogroup. Mutations in a 1,057-bp region of rpoB, which encodes the bacterial target of rifaximin, were identified in 10/12 resistant strains versus 0/50 sensitive strains (P {\textless} 0.000000001) and consisted of seven amino acid substitutions. The efflux pump inhibitor Phe-Arg-beta-naphthylamide (PAbetaN) lowered the MIC of 9/12 resistant strains 8- to 128-fold. Resistance was stable in the absence of rifaximin in 10/12 resistant strains after 30 passages. We conclude that IBD-associated ileal E. coli frequently manifest resistance to rifaximin that correlates with prior rifaximin use, amino acid substitutions in rpoB, and activity of PAbetaN-inhibitable efflux pumps, but not with the presence of ileal inflammation or E. coli phylogroup.

In Canada and the United States, the spread of MRSA is primarily attributed to a single dominant epidemic clone: CMRSA10/USA300. Despite this, the CMRSA7/USA400 epidemic clone has been reported to be the predominate epidemic clone in several Canadian provinces and some parts of the United States. This study examined the epidemiology of CMRSA7/USA400 MRSA in Alberta, Canada, from June 2005 to December 2012. Molecular characterization of CMRSA7/USA400 isolates was done using spa, SCCmec, PVL, and PFGE typing and identified two predominant spa types in Alberta: t128 and t1787. Although closely related, these spa types have distinct geographic distributions. From 2010 to 2012, the number of t128 infections has remained stable while there has been a nearly 3-fold increase in the number of provincial t1787 infections, accompanied by 10-fold increases in t1787 infection rates in some communities. Most t128 and t1787 patients were First Nations or Inuit people, and isolates were usually from skin and soft tissue infections in outpatients. t128 patients were significantly older than t1787 patients.

Materials and Methods: Forty E. coli were collected from Tainan Hospital in 2007 - 2008 and identified in our laboratory. Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by disc diffusion method. Five bla genes and 12 virulence factors were examined by multiplex PCR. The plasmid number and size were analyzed. Plasmid mediated resistance genes were investigated. Results: Although 5 bla genes were examined, 6 isolates lacked any bla. Over 60{\%} of E. coli isolates produced ESBL and contained more than one bla. The predominant bla genes were blaCMY (70{\%}), blaTEM (57.5{\%}), blaSHV (20{\%}), blaCTX-M3 (15{\%}), blaCTX-M14 (12.5{\%}), and blaDHA (5{\%}). Examination of ciprofloxacin resistance isolates found mutations in the gyrA and parC and three plasmid mediated qnr genes qnrA, qnrB, and qnrS. The associated of bla and qnr were determined for qnrA with blaCMY, qnrB with blaDHA, and qnrS with bla CMY and blaSHV.

Result: Among 121 H. pylori strains, the resistance rate to metronidazole was 72.70{\%}(88/121), and the MIC ranged from 0.016 mg/L to beyond 256 mg/L; to clarithromycin1,4.88{\%}(18/121), MIC ranged from 0.016 mg/L to beyond 256 mg/L; to Levofloxacin, 14.05{\%}(17/121), MIC from 0.02 mg/L to beyond 256 mg/L; amoxicillin 0.83{\%}(1/121), MIC from 0.016 mg/L to 2 mg/L; furazolidone 0{\%} (0/121). Conclusion: In Jiangxi Province, the resistance rate of H. pylori to metronidazole was the highest (72.70{\%}), and the second was to clarithromycin and Levofloxacin (14.88{\%}, 14.05{\%}respectively).

Aim To investigate the prevalence of mutations in genes associated with drug resistance in M. leprae isolates from patients with leprosy in Shandong Province. Methods The DRDR in the FolP1, RpoB and GyrA genes was analysed by direct sequencing of the PCR product from 85 isolates of M. leprae sampled from patients with leprosy in Shandong, China. Results Sequencing results were obtained for FolP1, RpoB and GyrA in 67, 57 and 81 of the 85 samples, with mutation rates of 1.5{\%} (1/67), 8.8{\%} 5/57 and 25.9{\%} (21/81). Three multidrug-resistant samples were found among the new cases: one had a mutation in both Folp1 and RpoB, while the other two had a mutation in both RpoB and GyrA. Conclusions Primary resistance appears to be to either single drugs or combinations of two drugs. The resistance rate to dapsone seems to be low.

12406,YES,Lobel2008,Article,"INTRODUCTION: The treatment of urinary tract infection (UTI) in women is based mainly on empirical antibiotic therapy. It requires up-to-date knowledge of the susceptibility patterns of the bacteria most commonly identified in that setting. The aim of this prospective study was to measure the antibiotic susceptibility of Escherichia coli isolates responsible for UTIs in women from a single area and to compare it in hospital and community settings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From May 2003 through April 2004, UTI was diagnosed in 1838 women around Rennes (France), 893 of them inpatients admitted to the teaching hospital and 945 outpatients in the community. We determined the susceptibility to 7 antibiotics of the resulting 1217 E. coli isolates. RESULTS: E. coli resistance rates in hospitalized and community patients were respectively 47.9{\%} and 39.2{\%} for aminopenicillins, 47.3{\%} and 25.4{\%} for coamoxiclav, 19.2{\%} and 14.1{\%} for cotrimoxazole, 14.3{\%} and 5.7{\%} for first-generation quinolones, and 8.9{\%} and 3.7{\%} for fluoroquinolones. All these rates were significantly higher among hospitalized patients (p{\textless}0.05). Conversely, resistance to injectable third-generation cephalosporins and fosfomycin was similar and infrequent in both groups.

Methods: From May 2005 to June 2009, 200 clinical isolates of Proteus mirabilis and Morganella morganii were isolated from patients with respiratory or urinary tract infections hospitalized at Military hospital in Tunis (Tunisia). Antibiotic susceptibility was tested with the agar disk diffusion method according to CASFM guidelines. ESBLs were detected using a standard double-disk synergy test. Characterisation of ESBLs and their genetic environments as well as integrons and their gene cassette composition were performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and nucleotide sequencing. For the genotyping method, we used pulsed-field gel electrophoresis using SfiI and SpeI restriction endonuclease. Results: 21 of 200 (7{\%}) strains exhibited non susceptibility to third generation cephalosporins and among these strains the double-disk synergy test confirmed the phenotype of ESBLs in 13 isolates (62{\%}). These ESBLs producers were coresistant to chloramphenicol, tetracyclin and ofloxacin, but remained susceptible to Ertapenem (MIC {\textless}0.25). By PCR and nucleotide sequencing, we detected the presence of bla genes as follows (number of isolates): blaCTX-M-15 (7), blaCTX-M-8 (1), blaTEM-24 (10), blaTEM-1(4) and blaTEM-2 (4). ISEcp1, IS26 and IS903, 0RF477 were located upstream and downstream, respectively, of the blaCTX-M-15 gene in 7 strains.

This isolate was resistant to penicillins, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones. A marked in vitro synergy between ceftazidime or cefotaxime and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid on Mueller-Hinton agar plates suggested the presence of an extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase. In addition, an unusual synergy was found between cefepime or aztreonam, and cefoxitin or imipenem on a double disk synergy test suggesting a VEB-type extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase. The characterization of beta-lactamases and associated resistance genes was performed by isoelectric focusing, polymerase chain reaction and nucleotide sequencing. Two beta-lactamases bands with pI values of 5.4 and 7.7, which were matched to TEM-1, VEB-1-a and OXA-2-like beta-lactamases were detected. The blaVEB-1-a gene was found to be associated with complex genetic structures, including Re elements. These beta-lactamases were not transferred by electroporation or conjugation experiments to the transconjugants and electroporants. Hybridization methods showed that the extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase encoding gene may have a chromosomal localization. The isolate SM662 produced the quinolone resistance determinants qnrA6 and aac(6')-Ib-cr which were successfully transferred.

13002,MAYBE,Manageiro2012a,Article,"Objectives: The identification of isolates containing AmpC blactamases is epidemiologically and clinically relevant. With this study we performed the phenotypic and molecular characterization of two new CMY-2-types, designated CMY-46 and CMY-50, encountered among a total of 1664 clinical non-duplicate isolates of various Enterobacteriaceae species. Methods: E. coli INSRA1169 and INSRA3413 were isolated from the urine of patients with 77 years and 7 months old, hospitalized in the ward and in pediatrics, respectively. The blaCMY genes were cloned in the plasmid pBK-CMV and transformed into electrocompetent E. coli DH5 alpha delta ampC by electroporation. Antimicrobial susceptibility (MIC) was determined by a microdilution method. E. coli INSRA6015, a CMY-2-producer, was used for phenotype comparison. PCR-mapping of the genetic environment of new blaCMY genes was performed using primers for known antibiotic and mercury resistance genes. Results: Antimicrobial susceptibly tests showed that all isolates and respective transformants were nonsusceptible to amoxicillin, amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, cephalothin, cefoxitin, ceftazidime and cefotaxime. INSRA1169 and INSRA6015 were also nonsusceptible to ciprofloxacin and to trimethoprim. Regarding gentamycin, only INSRA1169 was resistant. Its noteworthy that the transformants EcDH5a(pBK-CMY-2) and EcDH5a(pBK-CMY-46) exhibited higher values for extended-spectrum cephalosporins than the respective isolates. All strains were susceptible to cefepime and imipenem, showing synergy between cloxacilin and cefoxitin and/or ceftazidime. No phenotypic alterations were found comparing the new CMY-type with the parental CMY-2. The genetic characterization of CMY-46 and CMY-50-encoding genes revealed a Citrobacter freundii chromosometype structure, encompassing a blc-sugE-blaCMY-2-type-ampR platform in both isolates. In addition, a sul1-type class 1 integron and a truncated mercury resistance operon were encountered. Conclusion: Although the CMY-type enzymes studied conferred resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins, the susceptibility to cefepime lead us to assume that those enzymes are not extendedspectrum cephalosporinases. Otherwise, the presence of three genetic resistance-encoding regions is of great concern, namely the truncated mercury resistance operon, which may help to promote antibiotic resistance through indirect selection.",V Manageiro and D Louro and E Ferreira and M Canic¸a,1198-743X,Clinical Microbiology and Infection,"Citrobacter freundii,Enterobacteriaceae,Escherichia coli,amoxicillin,amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid,antibiotic agent,antibiotic resistance,antibiotic sensitivity,antiinfective agent,cefalotin,cefepime,cefotaxime,cefoxitin,ceftazidime,cephalosporin derivative,ciprofloxacin,electroporation,environment,enzyme,gene,genetic resistance,gentamicin,human,imipenem,infection,integron,mercury,microbiology,operon,patient,pediatrics,phenotype,plasmid,species,trimethoprim,urine,ward",738--739,"{Phenotypic and molecular characterisation of CMY-46 and CMY-50, two novel plasmid-mediated AmpC betalactamase carried by Escherichia coli}",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L70824204 http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-0691.2012.03803.x http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=1198743X{\&}id=doi:10.1111{\%}2Fj.1469-0691.2012.03803.x{\&}atitle=P,18,2012,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NO,Cale,MAYBE,Zach,Brooke,Zach_4,no,could not find full-text,

As only a few studies with a small number of samples were done in this regard in India, the present study was undertaken to report the prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility pattern of MRSA screened from diabetes patients with foot ulcers, attending tertiary care hospitals. Settings and Design: It was a retrospective study carried out at Department of Microbiology, Dr.N.G.P Arts and Science College, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India during the period from November 2002 to October 2006. Methods: The present study comprised of 7354 pus specimens of diabetic foot ulcer patients collected from various tertiary care hospitals in and around Coimbatore. All the samples were subjected to gram staining and bacterial culture, and the S. aureus isolates were screened for MRSA prevalence using conventional microbiological methods. Subsequently, the antibiotic sensitivity test was performed for the confirmed MRSA isolates. Results: Out of 2314 (37.82{\%}) strains of S. aureus isolated form diabetic foot ulcers, 992 (42.86{\%}) were found to be methicillin resistant.

The majority of patients had received a course of first-line antibiotics such as chloramphenicol, ampicillin or co-trimoxazole before admission. On bacteriological investigation, Salmonella Typhi was isolated from the blood of 11 patients with peritonitis. The isolates were all resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline and co-trimoxazole, but sensitive to third-generation cephalosporins, quinolone (nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacine) and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. Several factors contributed to the poor outcome of this disease including a) the use of inappropriate antibiotics, b) long delay in diagnosis, c) difficult access to health facilities.

14680,MAYBE,Muzevich2013,Article,"OBJECTIVE: To report a case of subtherapeutic linezolid concentrations in a patient with morbid obesity. CASE SUMMARY: A 34-year-old male with morbid obesity (265 kg, body mass index 82 kg/m2) was admitted for severe sepsis due to respiratory failure requiring emergent intubation and treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. Admission tracheal aspirate culture revealed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) for which vancomycin was prescribed. Therapy subsequently was changed to linezolid, because the patient's clinical status worsened, with significant hypoxia (partial pressure of arterial oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen [PaO2/FiO2] ratio 145), increasing leukocytosis (white blood cell count from 10,800/$\mu$L on admission to 15,400/$\mu$L on hospital day 6), and persistent fever (38.3 °C). After 48 hours of linezolid monotherapy, the patient remained febrile with continued leukocytosis, worsening hypoxemia, and a persistently positive MRSA culture from a repeat endotracheal aspirate. Linezolid serum concentrations were obtained and vancomycin was reinstituted, after which the patient began to improve (afebrile, improving PaO2/FiO2 ratio, decreasing leukocytosis). On hospital day 12, the patient removed his endotracheal tube, and a sputum sample was obtained for culture. The patient's clinical status subsequently declined, prompting addition of cefepime to his antibiotic regimen. This sputum culture revealed not only MRSA, but also quinolone-resistant Escherichia coli. After completing treatment for both organisms the patient was discharged home. DISCUSSION: Limited data on linezolid dosing in the morbidly obese population show lower serum drug concentrations than those in nonobese patients, but no clinical failure has been reported when treating MRSA skin and soft tissue infections or MRSA tracheitis. In our patient, low steady-state linezolid serum concentrations (peak 4.13 $\mu$g/mL [reference 15-27] and trough 1.27 $\mu$g/mL [reference 2-9]) were thought to contribute to his poor clinical response. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first report of subtherapeutic linezolid concentrations correlated with decreased clinical effectiveness when during treatment of MRSA pneumonia in a patient with morbid obesity. {\textcopyright} 1967-2013 Harvey Whitney Books Co.

14700,MAYBE,Naas2011,Article,"Plasmid-mediated 16S rRNA methylases such as ArmA, which confer high levels of resistance to aminoglycosides, are increasingly reported in Enterobacteriaceae. This study investigated the molecular mechanism of beta-lactam and aminoglycoside resistance in extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Salmonella enterica serotype Infantis isolated at the 53-bed neonatology ward of University Hospital Benabib in Constantine, Algeria. From September 2008 to January 2009, 200 S. enterica isolates were obtained from 138 patients (age range 8-80 months) hospitalised in the neonatology ward. Most isolates were from stool cultures, but also from two blood cultures and one gastric fluid. The isolates were multidrug-resistant and produced TEM-1 and CTX-M-15 enzymes as well as the 16S RNA methylase ArmA. The armA, bla(CTX-M-15) and bla(TEM-1) genes were located on the same 140-kb self-transferable plasmid belonging to the IncL/M incompatibility group. All of the S. Infantis isolates belonged to a single clone. Increased infection control measures and thorough biodecontamination of the rooms led to control of the outbreak but did not eradicate the epidemic strain. This study further illustrates the global emergence of ArmA methylase and its frequent association with bla(CTX-M) genes. Spread of 16S RNA methylase determinants at the same level as bla(CTX-M) genes in Enterobacteriaceae may seriously compromise the efficacy of aminoglycosides for treating Gram-negative infections.",T Naas and C Bentchouala and G Cuzon and S Yaou and A Lezzar and F Smati and P Nordmann,0924-8579,Int J Antimicrob Agents,"*Disease Outbreaks,Algeria/epidemiology,Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology,Blood/microbiology,Child,Child, Preschool,Cluster Analysis,Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial,Feces/microbiology,Gastric Juice/microbiology,Genotype,Hospitalization,Humans,Infant,Molecular Typing,Plasmids/analysis,Salmonella Infections/*epidemiology/*microbiology,Salmonella enterica/classification/drug effects/*g,beta-Lactamases/biosynthesis/*genetics,purification,tRNA Methyltransferases/biosynthesis/*genetics",135--139,"{Outbreak of Salmonella enterica serotype Infantis producing ArmA 16S RNA methylase and CTX-M-15 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase in a neonatology ward in Constantine, Algeria}",NA,38,2011,2,"1872-7913

This A. baumannii strain had both bla NDM-1 and bla OXA-23 by polymerase chain reaction analysis. In Japan, NDM-1-producing bacteria are extremely rare in clinical specimens. To date, three NDM-1-positive cases have been detected in Japan, and this is the first case of A. baumannii-producing NDM-1 in Japan.

Salmonella typhi or paratyphi infections should be evoked in case of persistent fever in patients having traveled to endemic areas, even if digestive signs are absent.

Urgent antibiotic treatment can save patients' lives, but antibiotic resistance can make antibiotic therapy useless. This study is the first to collect epidemiological data on BSI from Unguja, Zanzibar, and can help optimize local guidelines for empiric treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS Clinical data and blood for culturing and susceptibility testing were obtained from 469 consecutively enrolled neonates, children and adults presenting with signs of systemic infections at Mnazi Mmoja Hospital, Zanzibar. RESULTS Pathogenic bacteria were recovered from the blood of 14{\%} of the patients (66/469). The most frequently isolated microbes were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter spp. and Staphylococcus aureus. The infection was community-acquired in 56 patients (85{\%}) and hospital-acquired in 8 (12{\%}) (missing data in 2 patients). BSI caused by extendedspectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae (E. coli, K. pneumoniae) was found in 5 cases, communityacquired in 3 and hospital-acquired in 2 infections. Three of these patients died. Six of 7 Salmonella typhi isolates were multidrug resistant. Streptococcus pneumoniae was found in one patient only. CONCLUSIONS This is the first report of ESBL-producing bacteria causing BSI in Zanzibar. Our finding of communityacquired BSI caused by ESBL-producing bacteria is alarming, as it implies that these difficult-to-treat bacteria have already spread in the society.

16683,MAYBE,Pletz2006a,Article,"Fluoroquinolone resistance in Streptococcus pyogenes has been described only anecdotally. In this study we describe two invasive ciprofloxacin-resistant S. pyogenes isolates (ciprofloxacin MICs, 8 mg/liter), one of which shows evidence of interspecies recombination. The quinolone resistance-determining regions of gyrA and parC were sequenced. In both isolates, there was no evidence for an efflux pump and no mutation in gyrA. Both isolates had an S79F mutation inparC that is known to confer fluoroquinolone resistance. In addition, a D91N mutation in parC, which is not related to fluoroquinolone resistance but is a feature of the parC sequence of Streptococcus dysgalactiae, was found in one isolate. The parC nucleotide sequence of that isolate showed greater diversity than that of S. pyogenes. A GenBank search and phylogenetic analysis suggest that this isolate acquired resistance by horizontal gene transfer from S. dysgalactiae. Statistical testing for recombination confirmed interspecies recombination of a 90-bp sequence containing the S79F mutation from S. dysgalactiae. For the other isolate, we could confirm that it acquired resistance by spontaneous mutation by identifying the susceptible ancestor in an outbreak setting.

16801,MAYBE,Porres-Osante2014,Article,"OBJECTIVES: To characterize the mechanisms involved in carbapenem resistance, as well as the genetic elements supporting their mobilization, in a multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli isolate. METHODS: The E. coli isolate was obtained from a patient with fatal urinary sepsis. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by the disc diffusion and agar dilution methods. The E. coli molecular type and phylogroup were determined using multilocus sequence typing and the triple PCR technique, respectively. PCR and sequencing were used for virulence and resistance genotype characterization. Plasmid content and gene location were analysed by S1-PFGE, I-Ceu1-PFGE and hybridization experiments. Transformation assays were performed. RESULTS: The E. coli strain, typed as ST448 and phylogroup B1, was resistant to all tested antibiotics except fosfomycin, tigecycline and tetracycline. The following resistance and virulence genetic structures were obtained: ISKpn7 + bla(KPC-3) + ISKpn6 linked to Tn4401; tnpR + aac(6')-Ib'-9 + aadA1 + bla(OXA-9) + tnpR + bla(TEM-1a) + tnpB + strB + strA + sul2; intI1 + bla(VIM-1) + aac(6')-Ib' + aphA15 + aadA1 + catB2 + qacEDelta1-sul1 + orf5; ISEcp1 + bla(CMY-2); IS26 + bla(SHV-12); aph(3')-I; aac(3)-IV; floR; catA; and fimA. Mutations in the ampC promoter (-18, -1 and +58) and substitutions in the GyrA (Ser-83--{\textgreater}Leu and Asp-87--{\textgreater}Asn) and ParC (Ser-80--{\textgreater}Ile) proteins were observed. IncFII (ST2), IncA/C and ColE(TP) plasmids of 145.5, 87 and {\textless}2 kb, respectively, were found. The bla(VIM-1) gene was located in a non-typeable plasmid of {\textgreater}300 kb, and the bla(KPC-3) gene in the 145.5 kb IncFII plasmid. Transformant strains carried the IncFII and ColE(TP) plasmids, and the bla(KPC-3), bla(TEM-1a), bla(OXA-9), aadA1, aac(6')-Ib'-9, aac(3)-IV and floR genes. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of the co-production of KPC-3, VIM-1, SHV-12, OXA-9 and CMY-2 in a unique clinical multiresistant E. coli isolate. The dissemination of these genes on mobile genetic elements is alarming and complicates antimicrobial therapies.",N Porres-Osante and J M Azcona-Gutierrez and B Rojo-Bezares and E Undabeitia and C Torres and Y Saenz,0305-7453,J Antimicrob Chemother,"*Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial,Aged,Bacterial Proteins/*genetics/*secretion,Cmy-2,DNA, Bacterial/chemistry/genetics,Escherichia coli Infections/*microbiology,Escherichia coli/*drug effects/*enzymology/genetic,Fatal Outcome,Female,Gene Transfer, Horizontal,Humans,Interspersed Repetitive Sequences,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Molecular Sequence Data,Polymerase Chain Reaction,Sequence Analysis, DNA,Spain,St448,Urinary Tract Infections/microbiology,aac(6')-Ib',beta-Lactamases/*genetics/*secretion,carbapenems,plasmids",1792--1795,{Emergence of a multiresistant KPC-3 and VIM-1 carbapenemase-producing Escherichia coli strain in Spain},NA,69,2014,7,"1460-2091

17441,MAYBE,Reich2016a,Article,"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections cause significant morbidity and mortality in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). We characterized the clinical and molecular epidemiology of MRSA strains colonizing NICU patients. Nasal MRSA isolates (n = 250, from 96 NICU patients) recovered through active surveillance from 2009 to 2014 were characterized with staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing and detection of mupA (marker of high-level mupirocin resistance) and qacA/B (marker associated with chlorhexidine resistance). Factors associated with community-associated (CA-) or healthcare-associated (HA-) MRSA were evaluated. The overall prevalence of MRSA nasal colonization was 3.9{\%}. Of 96 neonates in our retrospective cohort, 60 (63{\%}) were colonized with CA-MRSA strains and 35 (36{\%}) were colonized with HA-MRSA strains. Patients colonized with HA-MRSA were more likely to develop MRSA infections than patients colonized with CA-MRSA (13/35, 37{\%} versus 8/60, 13{\%}; p 0.007), although the interval from colonization to infection was shorter in CA-MRSA-colonized infants (median 0 days, range -1 to 4 versus HA-MRSA-colonized infants, 7 days, -1 to 43; p 0.005). Maternal peripartum antibiotics were associated with CA-MRSA colonization (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 8.7; 95{\%} CI 1.7-45.0); intubation and surgical procedures were associated with HA-MRSA colonization (aOR 7.8; 95{\%} CI 1.3-47.6 and aOR 6.0; 95{\%} CI 1.4-24.4, respectively). Mupirocin- and chlorhexidine-resistant MRSA was isolated from four and eight patients, respectively; carriage of a mupirocin-resistant strain precluded decolonization.

17685,MAYBE,RobustilloRodela2012,Article,"This report describes the epidemiological features of the first outbreak caused by KPC3 carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC-3-KP) in Spain and how it was effectively controlled. From 16 September 2009 to the end of February 2010, seven patients infected or colonised with KPC-3-KP were detected. Stool surveillance cultures were recovered from patients, doctors, nurses, nursing assistants, cleaners and hospital porters working in the affected units. Hand swabs were taken from workers and patients' relatives for culturing. Environmental samples were also taken. Patients infected or colonised with KPC-3-KP were placed in single rooms under contact precautions and 4{\%} chlorhexidine soap was used for their daily hygiene. Staff attended educational seminars and workshops on hand hygiene and isolation of patients. An alcohol-based disinfectant was used for surface cleaning and disinfecting.

18398,MAYBE,Sarma2011,Article,"PURPOSE: A study was carried out in an Indian teaching hospital in 2009 to detect the rate of surgical site infections (SSI) and peripheral vascular access site infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was a point-prevalence study involving over 300 patients. The presence of infection was determined according to the CDC criteria. Swabs were taken from the infected sites and identification and sensitivity were carried out using VITEK(R) 2 automated system. Characterisation of beta-lactamase was carried out at ARRML, Colindale, London. RESULTS: The rate of SSI was 15{\%} for the clean and clean-contaminated categories while that for the dirty contaminated category was 85{\%} (NNIS risk index 0). Cultures yielded definite or probable pathogens from 64{\%} (9/14) of the patients with SSI. In 1/3 rd of the cultures, Staphylococcus aureus was grown and the rest had Enterobacteriaceae, either extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers or Amp-C hyperproducers and, alarmingly, three isolates were positive for newly recognised New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1). In medicine, 87{\%} (n = 99) of the patients had a peripheral IV access device, 55{\%} developed associated phlebitis/infection and, in seven, probable pathogens were isolated (Candida species and Escherichia coli producing ESBL and NDM-1, respectively, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium). All ESBL and metallo-beta-lactamase producers were resistant to multiple classes of antimicrobials, the latter being sensitive only to colistin and tigecycline. The study also found that all post-operative patients were on antibiotics, 92{\%} on IV [213 defined daily doses (DDD)/100 post-op patients] limited mainly to the third-generation cephalosporins (26{\%}) and aminoglycosides (24{\%}) and imidazole derivatives (30{\%}). In medicine, 83{\%} (n = 82) were on IV antibiotics (123 DDD/100 bed-days), limited mainly to the third-generation cephalosporins (74{\%}). CONCLUSION: Indiscriminate use of antibiotics is a major problem predisposing patients to harm by multi-resistant pathogens. Carbapenems were in little use in this hospital, but the selection pressure exerted by cephalosporins and other unrelated classes was sufficient to select NDM-1-producing strains due to co-selection, suggesting a role of single plasmid carrying resistance genes to multiple classes.",J B Sarma and P K Bhattacharya and D Kalita and M Rajbangshi,0255-0857,Indian J Med Microbiol,"Adult,Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology,Catheter-Related Infections/microbiology,Cross Infection/*microbiology,Enterobacteriaceae Infections/*microbiology,Enterobacteriaceae/*drug effects/*enzymology/isola,Female,Hospitals, Teaching,Humans,India,Male,Surgical Wound Infection/microbiology,beta-Lactamases/*biosynthesis,beta-Lactams/pharmacology",22--27,{Multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae including metallo-beta-lactamase producers are predominant pathogens of healthcare-associated infections in an Indian teaching hospital},NA,29,2011,1,"1998-3646

18449,YES,Saunders2007,Article,"BACKGROUND: Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) has increasingly been isolated from individuals with no predisposing risk factors; however, such strains have rarely been linked to outbreaks in the hospital setting. The present study describes the investigation of an outbreak of CA-MRSA that occurred in the maternal-newborn unit of a large community teaching hospital in Toronto, Ontario. METHODS: Screening and clinical specimens collected from mothers and newborns delivered during the outbreak period, as well as from staff on the affected unit, were submitted for microbiological testing. Computerized delivery logs and nursing notes were reviewed, and a case control study was conducted. RESULTS: Analysis by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed 38 babies and seven mothers with MRSA colonization and/or infection by the same unique strain (Canadian MRSA-10-related) from September to December 2004. Isolates were characterized as having the staphylococcal chromosome cassette mec type IVa and were positive for the Panton-Valentine leukocidin gene. No one health care worker was associated with all cases; however, mothers and newborns exposed to one particular nurse (Nurse A) were almost 23 times (odds ratio 22.7, 95{\%} CI 3.3 to 195.9) more likely to acquire MRSA than those with no such contact. MRSA was successfully isolated from Nurse A and from an environmental swab of a telephone recently used by Nurse A; both isolates matched the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pattern of the outbreak strain. CONCLUSION: The first nosocomial outbreak of CA-MRSA among healthy newborns and postpartum mothers in Canada is described. Effective control of sustained MRSA transmission within an institution may require prompt identification, treatment and monitoring of colonized and/or infected staff. {\textcopyright}2007 Pulsus Group Inc.

In this report, a case of epidural abscess due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis with primary resistance to isoniazid and ethambutol was presented. A 57-year-old male patient was admitted to emergency service with ten days history of weakness in legs, disability of walking and fever. Neurological examination revealed paraplegia of lower extremities, numbness distal to T2 disc level and hyperactivity of deep tendon reflexes indicating transverse myelitis. Laboratory findings were as follows; ESR: 74 mm/hour, CRP: 22 g/L, ALT: 42 IU/L, AST: 45 IU/L and white blood cell count 23.000/mm3 (45{\%} polymorphonuclear leukocyte, 45{\%} lymphocyte, 10{\%} monocyte). Spinal magnetic resonance imaging showed a fusiform abscess localized at anterior epidural space and extending along levels of C5-6 and C6-7. The longitudinal dimension of the abscess was 3 cm. The lesion was hypointense on T1 and hyperintense on T2 weighted MRI images with prominent rim shaped contrast enhancement on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images. At fourth day of hospitalization the patient underwent neurosurgical management. M.tuberculosis was isolated from the cultures of operation material by Mycobacteria Growth Incubator Tube system (MGIT, BBL; BD, USA) on the 12th day. The isolate was found susceptible to streptomycin and rifampisin, but resistant to isoniazid and ethambutol. The treatment was initiated with rifampicin 600 mg/day, pyrazinamid 2 g/day, ethambutol 1.5 g/day and levofloxacin 500 mg/day. At the end of second month levofloxacin 500 mg/day and rifampisin 600 mg/day combination was sustained and total treatment period was planned as nine months.

Sporadic cases of NDM-1 positive strains have been reported from different countries, suggesting a widespread dissemination. The aim of this study was the detection of MBLs in Enterobacteriaceae isolated from patients in Tehran hospitals. After identification tests, the susceptibility to the antibiotics was done by Kirby-Bauer method and broth microdilution. Carbapenem-resistant isolates were tested for carbapenemase production using the modified Hodge test (MHT). Carbapenem-resistant strains screened for bla(KPC) gene and genes encoding MBLs. Twenty-three isolates (6.3{\%}) were resistant to meropenem, eleven isolates (3{\%}) were resistant to ertapenem, and four isolates (1.1{\%}) were resistant to imipenem. MHT was positive in 11 (47.8{\%}) of the carbapenem-resistant isolates. In March 2011, we detected a multiple drug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate that was resistant to all tested antibiotics except colistin.

20506,MAYBE,Tang2012a,Article,"Objectives: Rifampin is a key component of standard short-course first-line therapy against M. tuberculosis, and the resistance to rifampin has been reported to connect to the mutations of the rpoB gene. The objective of this study was to detect the rpoB gene mutations in rifampin-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates circulated in Sichuan, as well as the possible correlation between molecular typing of TB population and rpoB mutation patterns that confer rifampin resistance in M. tuberculosis. Methods: Antimicrobial drug susceptibility test of M. tuberculosisisolates from 3645 pulmonary tuberculosis patients from different regions of Sichuan province from January 2008 to May 2010 was carried out by standard conventional proportion method. Spoligotying and sequencing of the rpoB gene were performed for 268 randomly selected isolates, including 213 rifampin-resistant and 55 rifampin-susceptible isolates. Results: Mutations in the rpoB gene were detected in 207 (97.2{\%}) of 213 rifampin-resistant isolates and one (1.8{\%}) of 55 rifampinsusceptible isolates, respectively. The most common mutations were in codon 531 (55.9{\%}), 526 (16.4{\%}), 516 (10.3{\%}), together accounting for 82.6{\%} of rifampin-resistant isolates. New mutations were also identified in codon 144 (Val-{\textgreater}Gly), 149 (Leu-{\textgreater}Pro), 401 (Val-{\textgreater}Phe) and 616 (Ser-{\textgreater}Leu) of rpoB gene in rifampin-resistant isolates. Among the 213 rifampin-resistant isolates, 150 (70.4{\%}) belonged to the Beijing family and mutation at codon 531 (TCG- {\textgreater}TTG) was associated with Beijing genotype (Fisher exact test, p = 0.0025). Conclusion: The new mutations identified in this study illustrate the need to disclose the unknown rifampin-resistance-associated mutations in M. tuberculosis isolates for an improved identification of rifampinresistant isolates.

This study was the first to examine S. aureus isolates from CF patients in the Czech Republic. Among 100 S. aureus isolates from 92 of 107 observed patients, we found a high prevalence of resistance to macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLS(B)) antibiotics (56{\%}). More than half of the resistant strains (29 of 56) carried a mutation in the MLS(B) target site. The emergence of MLS(B) resistance and mutations conferring resistance to MLS(B) antibiotics was associated with azithromycin treatment (p=0.000000184 and p=0.000681, respectively). Methicillin resistance was only detected in 3{\%} of isolates and the rate of resistance to other antibiotics did not exceed 12{\%}. The prevalence of small-colony variant (SCV) strains was relatively low (9{\%}) and eight of nine isolates with the SCV phenotype were thymidine dependent. The study population of S. aureus was heterogeneous in structure and both the most prevalent community-associated and hospital-acquired clonal lineages were represented.

20957,YES,ToprakUlger2013,Article,"Bacteroides species, the predominant constituents of the human intestinal microbiota can cause serious intraabdominal and postoperative wound infections and bacteremia. Moreover, these bacteria are more resistant to antimicrobial agents than the other anaerobes. The limited number of the antimicrobials, such as carbapenems, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors and nitroimidazoles are highly effective in eliminating Bacteroides. However, a few metronidazole- resistant isolates have been reported from several countries recently. The nim genes (nim A-G) are suggested to be responsible for the majority of the metronidazole resistance. Here, we describe a metronidazole-resistant Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron isolated from a blood culture. A gram-negative obligate anaerobic rod was isolated from the postoperative 5th day blood culture of a 62-year-old male patient with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas head. The strain was identified as B.thetaiotaomicron by using a combination of conventional tests and commercially available biochemical kits. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by agar dilution method. The resistance genes were investigated by means of PCR using specific primer pairs for nim gene. The purified PCR product was sequenced and analyzed by comparison of the consensus sequences with CenBank sequences. The MIC for metronidazole was 16 mg/L. Although the strain was intermediate according the CLSI criteria, it was resistant ({\textgreater} 4 mg/L) according to EUCAST criteria. The isolate was nim gene positive, and nucleotide sequencing of the PCR product shared 100{\%} similarity with nimE gene (embJAM042593.1J). On the other hand the isolate was susceptible to carbapenems and sulbactam-am-picillin. Following administration of ampicillin-sulbactam, the patient's fever disappeared after 24 hours. The clinical condition improved considerably and he was discharged at day 8. The patient was followed up at the medical oncology clinic; however he died due to disease progression six months after surgery. Since anaerobic bacteremia is associated with high mortality rate, prompt diagnosis and proper management are critical. The studies on Bacteroides bacteremia have revealed adverse outcomes in patients receiving antibiotics to which the bacterium was resistant. In the present case, the metronidazole-resistant organism would be reported as susceptible according to CLSI breakpoint value and on account of this result the treatment might lead to clinical failure. Therefore EUCAST MIC values seem to be more rational in case of Bacteroides antibiotic susceptibility testing.",N {Toprak Ulger} and E Sayin and A Soyad and F Dane and G Soyletir and N {Toprak Ülger} and E Sayin and F Dane and G Söyletir,"0374-9096 (Print)

METHODS: A carbapenem-resistant clinical isolate of K. pneumoniae was recovered from a hospitalized Greek patient. Detailed susceptibility testing was carried out by the agar dilution method. The isolate was screened by phenotypic and genotypic assays for the presence of various beta-lactamases. Boronic acid disc tests were performed to show the ability of these tests to detect production of the KPC enzymes. The potential for conjugal transfer of carbapenem resistance was examined by biparental matings, plasmid analysis and PCR studies. RESULTS: The isolate possessed on the same self-transferable plasmid the KPC-2 carbapenemase and the SHV-12 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. Although the isolate did not produce an AmpC-type enzyme, the production of KPC-2 was associated with positive boronic acid disc tests using cephamycins and cefotaxime as well as cefepime and carbapenems as substrates. DISCUSSION: KPC-2-possessing K. pneumoniae clinical isolates seem to have been introduced in our region.

OBJECTIVE: To determine U.S. trends in the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance of N. gonorrhoeae from 1988 to 2003. DESIGN: 16-year, multisite, sentinel surveillance for gonococcal isolate susceptibility through the Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project (GISP). SETTING: Sexually transmitted disease clinics in 37 cities. PATIENTS: Male patients with a total of 82,064 episodes of urethral gonorrhea. MEASUREMENTS: Primary outcome measures included percentage of gonococcal isolates resistant to antimicrobials used to treat gonorrhea, percentage of patients treated with specific antimicrobials for gonorrhea, and trends of these measures over time. RESULTS: The median age of patients was 26 years, and 74.1{\%} of patients were African American. The proportion of men treated with penicillins for gonorrhea declined from 39.5{\%} in 1988 to 0{\%} in 1994, while the proportion of those receiving fluoroquinolone treatment increased from 0{\%} in 1988 to 42.0{\%} in 2003. Penicillin resistance peaked at 19.6{\%} in 1991, then declined to 6.5{\%} in 2003. Tetracycline resistance peaked at 25.8{\%} in 1997 and declined to 14.4{\%} in 2003. The first fluoroquinolone-resistant isolate was found in 1991. Nationally, 0.4{\%} of isolates were fluoroquinolone-resistant in 1999 and were identified in 39{\%} of GISP cities. By 2003, 4.1{\%} of isolates were fluoroquinolone-resistant and were identified in 70{\%} of GISP cities. Isolates with decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone, cefixime, azithromycin, and spectinomycin remained rare. In 2001, 3 multidrug-resistant isolates with decreased susceptibility to cefixime were identified. LIMITATION: Sentinel surveillance may not fully reflect trends for all patients with gonorrhea in the United States. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of penicillin resistance has declined in the years since gonorrhea treatment with penicillin was discontinued. Fluoroquinolone-resistant N. gonorrhoeae infections continue to increase at a time when fluoroquinolone use has increased. Ongoing nationwide and local antimicrobial susceptibility monitoring is crucial to ensure appropriate treatment of gonorrhea.",S A Wang and A B Harvey and S M Conner and A A Zaidi and J S Knapp and W L Whittington and C {del Rio} and F N Judson and K K Holmes,0003-4819,Ann Intern Med,"Adult,Anti-Infective Agents/*pharmacology,Azithromycin/pharmacology,Cephalosporins/pharmacology,Drug Resistance, Bacterial,Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial,Fluoroquinolones/*pharmacology,Gonorrhea/*microbiology,Humans,Male,Neisseria gonorrhoeae/*drug effects,Penicillin Resistance,Spectinomycin/pharmacology,Tetracycline Resistance,United States",81--88,"{Antimicrobial resistance for Neisseria gonorrhoeae in the United States, 1988 to 2003: the spread of fluoroquinolone resistance}",NA,147,2007,2,"1539-3704

Death from shigellosis is rare in Fiji. However, the global problem of emerging multi-drug resistance raises some issues about the management of Shigellosis in this country. Within Fiji, Shigella is a notifiable disease. The Fiji Ministry of Health recorded 68 cases of Shigella in 1996, 173 cases in 1997 and 334 cases in 1998 (no data available for 1999). There was only one recorded death during this time--in 1998. Resistance to chloramphenicol occurred in 82{\%} of cases. Shigella flexneri in Fiji remains sensitive to cephalothin and cefaclor. The current antibiotic guidelines in Fiji, recommend that antibiotics be used only for cases of moderate and severe dysentery. Shigellosis was suspected soon after presentation however the patient was unable to take oral antibiotics and was treated with intravenous antibiotics (chloramphenicol and ampicillin), which were ineffective due to resistance of the organism. The current antibiotic guidelines for severe dysentry recommend chloramphenicol or nalidixic acid--the later not available in Fiji. However the only intravenous drugs that retain their sensitivity to Shigella--ceftriaxone and cephalothin, are expensive ({\$}F 45.00 per vial' of ceftdaxone) and these are only available in large regional hospitals.",C Watson,"1015-7867 (Print)

22366,YES,Weissman2013,Article,"Resistance to extended-spectrum beta-lactams is increasing worldwide among Escherichia coli and has been linked to a small number of emergent clones (e.g. ST38, ST131 and ST405) recovered from extraintestinal infections in community and hospital settings. There are, however, limited data about the relative contributions of bacterial strains, plasmids and beta-lactamase genes to extended-spectrum beta-lactam resistance in paediatric infections. We performed an extensive molecular analysis of phylogenetic, virulence and antibiotic resistance-related properties of 49 previously reported serial E. coli isolates recovered during 1999-2007 at Seattle Children's Hospital (Seattle, WA). Class C enzyme CMY-2 and class A enzyme CTX-M-15 were the most prominent extended-spectrum beta-lactam resistance enzymes in the collection, first appearing in this patient population in 2001 and 2003, respectively, and then steadily increasing in frequency over the remainder of the study period. Among 19 CMY-2-positive isolates, 16 distinct STs were detected (D = 98.25{\%}, 95{\%} CI 96-100.25{\%}), indicating that CMY spread is non-clonal at the host strain level. In contrast, among ten CTX-M-15-positive isolates, three STs were detected (D = 37.78{\%}, 95{\%} CI 2.36-73.20{\%}), of which eight represented the worldwide-disseminated ST131 lineage, consistent with clonal spread of CTX-M-15-associated resistance. fimHTR subtyping of ten ST131 isolates (including two CTX-M-negative isolates) revealed that, within ST131, carriage of allele fimHTR30 correlated with CTX-M-15 positivity, whilst carriage of non-fimHTR30 alleles correlated with carriage of non-CTX-M enzymes. Thus, spread of CMY-2 is non-clonal at the ST level, but clonal spread of CTX-M-15 may be associated with a specific fimHTR-defined sublineage of ST131.",S J Weissman and A Adler and X Qin and D M Zerr,0924-8579,Int J Antimicrob Agents,"*Genetic Variation,Academic Medical Centers,Adolescent,Adult,Child,Child, Preschool,Escherichia coli Infections/*epidemiology/microbio,Escherichia coli/classification/*enzymology/geneti,Female,Hospitals, Pediatric,Humans,Infant,Male,Molecular Epidemiology,Molecular Typing,Phylogeny,Virulence Factors/genetics,Washington/epidemiology,Young Adult,beta-Lactamases/*genetics",414--420,"{Emergence of extended-spectrum beta-lactam resistance among Escherichia coli at a US academic children's hospital is clonal at the sequence type level for CTX-M-15, but not for CMY-2}",NA,41,2013,5,"1872-7913

Because the patient had received rifampin monotherapy during the course of treatment for presumed BCG disease, the clinical picture favoured acquired rifampin resistance.

P. fulva is a very rare cause of infection and only two cases due to this pathogen (meningitis and bloodstream infection) were reported. Furthermore, class 1 integron containing bla VIM-2 metallo-b-lactamase (MBL) gene has been found in this species. Methods: Pseudomonas spp. isolate screening positive for MBL production was found from urine of a 70 years old male patient with lung cancer and analyzed in Kyoto University Hospital, Japan. Specieslevel identification was carried out by sequencing gyrB gene, rpoB gene, and rpoD gene. The MBL genes (IMP, VIM, SPM, GIM and SIM) were detected by multiplex PCR. Integrase genes (intI1 , intI2, and intI3 ) were detected by PCR. To identify the genetic environment of MBL gene, the total of extracted genome was digested with restriction enzyme EcoRI, and obtained fragments were ligated into pUC19 vector digestedwith EcoRI. All of recombination plasmidswere electroporated into Escherichia coli , and cultured on LB agar with ceftazidime (4 mg/ml). Then recombination plasmid containing MBL gene was selected. Selected plasmid was extracted and sequenced. Results: P. fulva was confirmed by species-level identification. IMPtype MBL gene and intI3 gene were detected from this isolate. As the result of analyzing the genetic environment of MBL gene, class 3 integron containing bla IMP-1 was found and this integron included two other resistance gene cassettes. The order of these resistance gene cassettes was as follows: intI3 -aac( 6')-31-fosE -bla IMP-1.

22980,YES,Yang2016f,Article,"Background: The majority of nontyphoid Salmonella infection is identified in children. When an invasive or severe Salmonella infection is encountered, ceftriaxone is recommended for such patients. A 2-year-old girl was hospitalized for the treatment of Salmonella bacteremia and discharged with standard ceftriaxone treatment. She was readmitted to the hospital after 2 days due to the recurrence of the Salmonella bacteremia. The study aimed to unveil the mechanism for the relapse. Methods: Six isolates (blood and 2 stool) were recovered from the patient, with the last two blood isolates being ceftriaxone-resistant. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was used for genotyping. Ceftriaxone resistance genes and transferability of the resistance plasmid were examined by molecular methods. Results: All isolates were identified as Salmonella enterica serotype Oranienburg. Five isolates demonstrated almost identical electrophoresis patterns, except that in the two ceftriaxone-resistant isolates an extra band ({\textgreater}100 kb) was noted. A blaCMY-2 gene, carried by a 120-kb conjugative IncI1 plasmid of the sequence type 53, was identified in the two ceftriaxone-resistant isolates. Transfer of the resistance plasmid from one blood isolate to Escherichia coli J53 resulted in the increase of ceftriaxone minimum inhibitory concentration from 0.125 $\mu$g/mL to 32 $\mu$g/mL in the recipient. Conclusion: Ceftriaxone is the standard therapeutic choice for invasive or serious Salmonella infections in children. Pediatricians should be aware of the possibility of resistance development during therapy, especially in areas with a widespread of ceftriaxone resistance genes that are carried by a self-transferrable plasmid, such as the blaCMY-2-carrying IncI1 plasmid identified herein.",W C Yang and O W Chan and T L Wu and C L Chen and L H Su and C H Chiu,"1995-9133

Gene libraries and amplification of class 1 integrons revealed three resistance-conferring regions; the first contained bla(CMY-4) flanked by ISEcP1 and blc. The second region of 4.8 kb contained a complex class 1 integron with the gene cassettes arr-2, a new erythromycin esterase gene; ereC; aadA1; and cmlA7. An intact ISCR1 element was shown to be downstream from the qac/sul genes. The third region consisted of a new MBL gene, designated bla(NDM-1), flanked on one side by K. pneumoniae DNA and a truncated IS26 element on its other side. The last two regions lie adjacent to one another, and all three regions are found on a 180-kb region that is easily transferable to recipient strains and that confers resistance to all antibiotics except fluoroquinolones and colistin. NDM-1 shares very little identity with other MBLs, with the most similar MBLs being VIM-1/VIM-2, with which it has only 32.4{\%} identity. As well as possessing unique residues near the active site, NDM-1 also has an additional insert between positions 162 and 166 not present in other MBLs. NDM-1 has a molecular mass of 28 kDa, is monomeric, and can hydrolyze all beta-lactams except aztreonam. Compared to VIM-2, NDM-1 displays tighter binding to most cephalosporins, in particular, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, and cephalothin (cefalotin), and also to the penicillins. NDM-1 does not bind to the carbapenems as tightly as IMP-1 or VIM-2 and turns over the carbapenems at a rate similar to that of VIM-2. In addition to K. pneumoniae 05-506, bla(NDM-1) was found on a 140-kb plasmid in an Escherichia coli strain isolated from the patient's feces, inferring the possibility of in vivo conjugation. The broad resistance carried on these plasmids is a further worrying development for India, which already has high levels of antibiotic resistance.",D Yong and M A Toleman and C G Giske and H S Cho and K Sundman and K Lee and T R Walsh,"0066-4804

23192,MAYBE,Yu2012a,Article,"Outbreaks caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae producing carbapenemases and other beta-lactamases have been reported. Four neonates admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in a Chinese hospital developed respiratory infection while receiving intensive care. In all four cases, multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae was isolated from multiple respiratory specimens, leading to additional characterization of these organisms and investigation of the local environment in the NICU. Multiple beta-lactamase genes, including bla(TEM-1), bla(IMP-4), bla(DHA-1) and bla(CTX-M-14), as well as the quinolone resistance gene qnrB4, were harboured by transferable plasmids from all four clinical isolates. Furthermore, PFGE confirmed that three of the four clinical isolates from the patients and three K. pneumoniae isolates collected from the hands of health-care workers and an incubator in the NICU belonged to the same PFGE cluster, indicating that an outbreak due to multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae carrying bla(IMP-4) and bla(DHA-1) occurred in this NICU. As far as is known, this is the first report of the co-existence of bla(IMP-4) and bla(DHA-1) in the same K. pneumoniae isolate.

23252,MAYBE,Zagorianou2012,Article,"We report 570 carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (CPKP) clinical isolates in a 1,040-bed Greek tertiary hospital during 2004 to 2010. The first CPKP (VIM-producing) was isolated in September 2004. Despite initial containment, VIM producers have become endemic since 2006. KPC-producing K. pneumoniae was first isolated in August 2007 from a patient who came from Israel, spread rapidly, and outcompeted VIM. Overall, 267 (47{\%}) VIM-producing and 301 (53{\%}) KPC-producing strains were isolated, including 141 (24.7{\%}) from patients with bacteraemia. Two isolates carrying both VIM and KPC were isolated in two consecutive months in 2009, but not since. The prevalence of CPKP increased from 0{\%} in 2003 to 38.3{\%} in 2010 (p c;0.0001). All genotyped KPC producers harboured blaKPC-2 and belonged to two clones, among which the hyperepidemic Greek clone, related to those from the United States and Israel, predominated. Most metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) producers carried the blaVIM-1 gene and belonged to several clones, whereas all but one isolate with blaVIM-12 were clustered within a five-month period, arising from one clone. Resistance to non-beta-lactam antibiotics was also increased among CPKP. They were almost invariably resistant to ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Resistance to colistin increased from 3.5{\%} (4/115) in 2008 to 20.8{\%} (25/120) in 2010, and resistance to tigecycline also increased. Following reinforcement of infection control measures, prevalence of CPKP (mainly KPC) has been reduced since mid-2009 (from 46{\%} in 2009 to 38.3{\%} in 2010).
