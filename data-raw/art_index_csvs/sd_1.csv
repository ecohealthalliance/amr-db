38,yes,abdelhadi2012,article,"Culture and resistance testing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis are not regularly performed in Chad. Sputa were obtained from three different categories of hospitals (district, regional and national) in Chad. All examined sputa were smear-positive and were investigated by culture and drug resistance testing for first-line antituberculosis drugs. From 232 sputa positive for acid-fast bacilli, 135 isolates of M. tuberculosis from different patients (46 women, 89 men, mean age 34 years) were analyzed. All the patients except one corresponded to new cases of tuberculosis. In total, 27 out of 135 isolates (20{\%}) were resistant to at least one major antituberculosis drug. Resistance to isoniazid was the most frequent resistance observed, with 18 isolates (13{\%}) presenting at least this resistance. Three isolates (2.2{\%}) were resistant to isoniazid and rifampicin (multidrug resistance MDR) including one isolate being concomitantly resistant to streptomycin and ethambutol. The resistance rate differed in relation to the category of the hospital; the most important resistance rate was observed in regional hospitals (33{\%}), while it was 16{\%} and 14{\%} in the national and district hospitals, respectively. HIV serology was performed in 81 patients, among whom 20 (25{\%}) were positive. This is the first study that shows that drug resistance of M. tuberculosis is present in Chad. Besides single drug-resistant isolates, multidrug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis could also be identified.

4717,no,david2008,article,"AIM OF THE STUDY: This retrospective study was conducted in order to characterize mechanisms of resistance to beta-lactams and clonality of 24 isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These strains were isolated from patients hospitalized in Rouen University Hospital between August 2004 and December 2006 and were resistant to cefepime and/or ceftazidime (PMR) by a mechanism not only related to overproduction of the cephalosporinase. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical strains of PMR were characterized by conventional biochemical methods, antibiotic susceptibility testing by disk diffusion in agar with or without cloxacillin and RAPD for genetic comparison. Identification of beta-lactamase was performed by PCR amplification followed by sequencing of bla genes. RESULTS: All strains produced the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) TEM-116. Epidemiological study identified eight unrelated strains, eight related strains originating from a single unit, three related strains isolated in different wards and five related strains coproducing TEM-116 and SHV-2a but isolated in different units. Detection of ESBL in these strains was difficult due to a low level of ESBL production. CONCLUSION: This is the first report of TEM-116 in France in 24 strains of P. aeruginosa and its association with SHV-2a in five cases. SHV-2a has been described in P. aeruginosa in France but not TEM-116 which was recently reported in this species, in China and in Netherlands (in a strain coproducing SHV-12).

7761,yes,grisold2011,article,"Objectives: Extended-spectrum $\beta$-lactamase-producing (ESBL) Enterobacteriaceae have emerged as major public health problem throughout the world, in particular India and Pakistan. We report the emergence of the newly described resistance mechanism conferred by New Delhi metallo-$\beta$-lactamase 1 (NDM-1) in Austria. NDM-1 positive Enterobacteriaceae (2x Klebsiella pneumoniae and 1x E. coli) has been detected in three patients at the University Hospital of Graz, Austria, with all three cases occurring within the last 6 months. Methods: NDM-1 shares very little identity with other metallob- lactamase (MBL) enzymes and Enterobacteriaceae with NDM-1 show high resistance to nearly all commonly used antibiotics. Primers for PCR detection of NDM-1 were designed based on GenBank (National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) database entry AB571289.1 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/300422615). Results: NDM-1 was detected in isolates of three patients, in two cases in K. pneumoniae, and one patient with NDM-1 positive E. coli. All threecases occurred between December 2009 and August 2010. Patient one (NDM-1 K. pneumoniae), a 30-year-old Austrian male was admitted to our University Hospital in November 2009. History revealed that he had suffered multiple open fractures of his upper and lower left leg and rectal laceration due to a motorcycle accident in Pakistan. In patient two the NDM-1 K. pneumoniae was detected in August 2010, the patient being a 14-year-old Kosovarian boy transferred from Kosovo to the Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Graz, with multiple intraabdominal abscess formations and peritonitis. He had undergone appendectomy in Pristina, Kosovo, in April 2010 and had developed abdominal sepsis consecutively. Patient number three (NDM-1 E. coli), a 56 year old male developed a necrotizing fasciitis when being in India in January 2010, after a short admittance at a hospital in New Delhi the patient was transferred to Austria. Conclusion: Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae with the newly described resistance enzyme NDM-1 have been recently shown to pose the potential of growing to a major public health problem worldwide. We report the emergence of NDM-1 among Enterobacteriaceae in Austria.

15560,yes,onken2015a,article,"Background Bloodstream infections (BSI) are frequent and cause high case-fatality rates. Urgent antibiotic treatment can save patients' lives, but antibiotic resistance can render antibiotic therapy futile. This study is the first to collect epidemiological data on BSI from Unguja, Zanzibar. Methods Clinical data and blood for culturing and susceptibility testing of isolated microbes were obtained from 469 consecutively enrolled neonates, children and adults presenting with signs of systemic infections at Mnazi Mmoja Hospital (MMH), Zanzibar. Results Pathogenic bacteria were recovered fromthe blood of 14{\%}of the patients (66/469). The most frequently isolated microbes were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter spp. and Staphylococcus aureus. Infections were community-acquired in 56 patients (85{\%}) and hospital-acquired in 8 (12{\%}) (datamissing for 2 patients). BSI caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae (E. coli, K. pneumoniae) was found in 5 cases, of which 3 were community-acquired and 2 hospital-acquired. Three of these patients died. Six of 7 Salmonella Typhi isolates were multidrug resistant. Streptococcus pneumoniae was found in one patient only. Conclusions This is the first report of ESBL-producing bacteria causing BSI from the Zanzibar archipelago. Our finding of community-acquired BSI caused by ESBL-producing bacteria is alarming, as it implies that these difficult-to-treat bacteria have already spread in the society. In the local setting these infections are virtually impossible to cure. The findings call for increased awareness of rational antibiotic use, infection control and surveillance to counteract the problem of emerging antimicrobial resistance.",A Onken and A K Said and M Jorstad and P A Jenum and B Blomberg and M J???¬rstad and P A Jenum and B Blomberg,1932-6203,PLoS ONE,",*Drug Resistance,Acinetobacter,Adolescent,Adult,Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology,Bacteremia/drug therapy/*epidemiology/microbiology,Child,Community-Acquired Infections/drug therapy/*epidem,Cross Infection/drug therapy/*epidemiology/microbi,Escherichia coli,Female,Humans,Infant,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Male,Microbial,Newborn,Preschool,Prevalence,Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi,Staphylococcus aureus,Streptococcus pneumoniae,Tanzania,Tanzania/epidemiology,adolescent,adult,ampicillin,antibiotic resistance,antibiotic sensitivity,article,blood culture,bloodstream infection,cefotaxime,ceftazidime,child,chloramphenicol,ciprofloxacin,community acquired infection,cotrimoxazole,epidemiological data,extended spectrum beta lactamase producing Enterob,female,gentamicin,hospital infection,human,infant,major clinical study,male,meropenem,mortality,multidrug resistance,newborn,nonhuman,oxacillin,penicillin G,piperacillin plus tazobactam,preschool child,prevalence",e0145632,"{prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of microbes causing bloodstream infections in unguja, zanzibar}",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=l608043455 http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0145632 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=embase{\&}issn=19326203{\&}id=doi:10.1371{\%}2fjournal.pone.0145632{\&}atitle=prevalen,10,2015,12,"from duplicate 2 (prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of microbes causing bloodstream infections in unguja, zanzibar - onken, a; said, a k; jorstad, m; jenum, p a; blomberg, b)1932-6203onken, annettesaid, abdulrahman kjorstad, melissajenum, pal ablomberg, bjornjournal articleresearch support, non-u.s. gov'tunited statesplos one. 2015 dec 23;10(12):e0145632. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0145632. ecollection 2015.",10.1371/journal.pone.0145632,12/25/15,eng,26700032,maybe,brooke,no,erica,allison,zach_4,yes,sd_1.csv,NA,NA,sd_1_1.mex,yes,journal

18812,MAYBE,Sendi2016,Article,"Streptococcus agalactiae (group B Streptococcus [GBS]) is a leading cause of sepsis in neonates. The rate of invasive GBS disease in nonpregnant adults also continues to climb. Aminoglycosides alone have little or no effect on GBS, but synergistic killing with penicillin has been shown in vitro. High-level gentamicin resistance (HLGR) in GBS isolates, however, leads to the loss of a synergistic effect. We therefore performed a multicenter study to determine the frequency of HLGR GBS isolates and to elucidate the molecular mechanisms leading to gentamicin resistance. From eight centers in four countries, 1,128 invasive and colonizing GBS isolates were pooled and investigated for the presence of HLGR. We identified two strains that displayed HLGR (BSU1203 and BSU452), both of which carried the aacA-aphD gene, typically conferring HLGR. However, only one strain (BSU1203) also carried the previously described chromosomal gentamicin resistance transposon designated Tn3706. For the other strain (BSU452), plasmid purification and subsequent DNA sequencing resulted in the detection of plasmid pIP501 carrying a remnant of a Tn3 family transposon. Its ability to confer HLGR was proven by transfer into an Enterococcus faecalis isolate. Conversely, loss of HLGR was documented after curing both GBS BSU452 and the transformed E. faecalis strain from the plasmid. This is the first report showing plasmid-mediated HLGR in GBS. Thus, in our clinical GBS isolates, HLGR is mediated both chromosomally and extrachromosomally.",P Sendi and M Furitsch and S Mauerer and C Florindo and B C Kahl and S Shabayek and R Berner and B Spellerberg,"1098-6596

ST398 BSI incidence showed a seven-fold increase during the study period (0.002 per 1,000 patient days in 2007 vs. 0.014 in 2010). ST398 BSI isolates differed from the pig-borne multiresistant clone: 17/18 BSI isolates were methicillin susceptible and none was of t011, t034 or t108 pig-borne spa-types. ST398 BSI isolates had homogenous resistance patterns (15/18 with only Ery(r)) and prophagic content (all harboured the hlb-converting Sau3int phage). The clustering of BSI and pig-borne isolates by spa-typing and MLVA, the occurrence of Sau3int phage in BSI isolates and the lack of this phage in pig-borne isolates suggest that the emergence of BSI isolates could have arisen from horizontal transfer, at least of the Sau3int phage, in genetically diverse MSSA ST398 isolates. The acquisition of the phage likely plays a role in the increasing ability of the lysogenic ST398 isolates to colonize human. The mode of acquisition of the non pig-borne ST398 isolates by our 18 patients remains unclear. ST398 BSI were diagnosed in patients lacking livestock exposure and were significantly associated with digestive portals of entry (3/18 [16.7{\%}] for ST398 vs. 19/767 [2.5{\%}] for non ST398 BSI; p = .012).

METHODS: Susceptibility testing against first- and second-line drugs was performed on isolated Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains. Subsequently, the strains identified as XDR or TDR M tuberculosis were subjected to spoligotyping and variable numbers of tandem repeats (VNTR). RESULTS: Of 146 MDR-TB strains, 8 XDR isolates (5.4{\%}) and 15 TDR isolates (10.3{\%}) were identified. The remaining strains were either susceptible (67{\%}) or had other resistant patterns (20{\%}). Overall, the median of treatments and drugs previously received by MDR-TB patients was two courses of therapy of 15 months' duration with five drugs (isoniazid [INH], rifampicin [RF], streptomycin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide). The median of in vitro drug resistance for all studied cases was INH and RF. The XDR or TDR strains were collected from both immigrants (Afghan, 30.4{\%}; Azerbaijani, 8.6{\%}; Iraqi, 4.3{\%}) and Iranian (56.5{\%}) MDR-TB cases. In such cases, the smear and cultures remained positive after 18 months of medium treatment with second-line drugs (ethionamide, para-aminosalicylic acid, cycloserine, ofloxacin, amikacin, and ciprofloxacin). Spoligotyping revealed Haarlem (39.1{\%}), Beijing (21.7{\%}), EAI (21.7{\%}), and CAS (17.3{\%}) superfamilies of M tuberculosis. These superfamilies had different VNTR profiles, which eliminated the recent transmission among MDR-TB cases. CONCLUSIONS: The isolation of TDR strains from MDR-TB patients from different regional countries is alarming and underlines the possible dissemination of such strains in Asian countries.

21983,MAYBE,Voulgari2013,Article,"Objectives: First detected in Enterobacteriaceae isolates in Turkey, the OXA-48 carbapenemase has gradually disseminated in the wider Mediterranean area and Europe. Despite reports from other European regions, until now no such isolates have been detected in Greece. We describe the characteristics of the first outbreak caused by OXA-48-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae in Greece. Methods: From December 2011 to March 2012, 13 ertapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates, which were positive by the modified Hodge test while remaining negative by phenotypic screening for metallo-$\beta$-lactamase (MBL) and KPC production, were recovered from nine patients. Patient records were retrieved to access patterns of acquisition. Resistance genes were identified by PCR and sequencing. ompK35, ompK36 and the genetic environment of the blaOXA-48 gene were investigated. Plasmid profiling, conjugation experiments, PFGE and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) were performed. Results: All isolates harboured the blaOXA-48 gene along with the blaCTX-M-15 and blaOXA-1 genes. The blaOXA-48 gene was located on a self-transferable IncL/M-type plasmid of {\~{}}62 kb, which harboured no other resistance genes. IS1999 was located upstream of the blaOXA-48 gene. Genetic disruptions of the ompK35 and ompK36 genes were not detected. The isolates belonged to a unique PFGE clone and MLST assigned them to sequence type ST11. All cases were characterized as hospital acquired and none of them was linked to immigration or history of travel in endemic areas. Conclusions: Carbapenem resistance due to MBL and KPC carbapenemases is currently on an endemic scale in Greece and this report highlights the wider undetected dissemination of yet another carbapenemase in this region. {\textcopyright} The Author 2012.

22703,MAYBE,Wormser2010,Article,"Background. Babesiosis is an emerging tickborne malaria-like infection principally caused by Babesia microti. This infection typically resolves either spontaneously or after administration of a 7-10-day course of azithromycin plus atovaquone or clindamycin plus quinine. Although certain highly immunocompromised patients may respond suboptimally to these drug regimens, unlike the situation with malaria there has been no reported evidence that the cause of treatment failure is infection with drug-resistant strains of B. microti. Methods. Emergence of drug resistance in B. microti was defined as the development of a microbiologic relapse (recurrent parasitemia or a marked increase in parasitemia) in association with both clinical and laboratory abnormalities indicative of active babesiosis in a patient after Â‰Ã¤Â´ 28 days of uninterrupted antibabesia drug therapy and while still receiving treatment. Results. The clinical case histories of 3 highly immunocompromised patients who received a subcurative course of azithromycin-atovaquone associated with the eventual development of resistance to this drug regimen are described. One of the 3 patients died of complications related to babesiosis. Conclusions. B. microti may become resistant to azithromycin-atovaquone during the treatment of babesiosis with this combined drug regimen in highly immunocompromised patients. Although research is needed to de-termine the optimal therapy for highly immunocompromised patients with babesiosis, reducing the level of immunosuppression when possible would appear to be a desirable strategy. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

23199,MAYBE,Yu2014a,Article,"BACKGROUND: Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) infection is a serious public health problem. The third-generation extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ESCs) have been used as the first-line treatment for NG infection for almost three decades. However, in recent years, treatment failures with the oral third-generation ESCs have been reported worldwide. This study aimed to estimate worldwide susceptibility rates of NG to cefixime and cefpodoxime by analyzing data from all relevant published studies. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Two researchers independently searched five databases to identify studies on susceptibilities of NG to cefixime and cefpodoxime published between January 1, 1984 and October 15, 2012. A fixed-effect model was used to perform group analysis, and a chi2 test was employed to make subgroup comparison. Publication bias was assessed with the Begg rank correlation test. The pooled susceptibility rate of NG isolates to cefixime was 99.8{\%} (95{\%} CI: 99.7{\%}-99.8{\%}). The cefixime susceptibility rate of NG isolates from men was significantly lower than that from patients without information of gender or from men and women; the susceptibility rate of NG isolates from Asia was significantly lower than that from other continents; and the susceptibility rate of NG isolates collected before or during 2003 was significantly higher than that after 2003. The pooled susceptibility rate of NG isolates to cefpodoxime was 92.8{\%} (95{\%} CI: 89.0{\%}-95.3{\%}), which was lower than that to cefixime (92.8{\%} vs. 99.8{\%}, chi2 = 951.809, P{\textless}0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The susceptibility rate of NG isolates to cefixime varied with the gender of patients and geographical location from which NG isolates were collected, and declined with time. The reported lower susceptibility rate of NG isolates to cefixime and associated treatment failures, as well as the emergence of NG strains with cephalosporin resistance call for the more effective control of NG infection and the development of new antibiotics.",R X Yu and Y Yin and G Q Wang and S C Chen and B J Zheng and X Q Dai and Y Han and Q Li and G Y Zhang and X Chen,1932-6203,PLoS ONE,",Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use,Asia,Cefixime/*therapeutic use,Ceftizoxime/*analogs {\&} derivatives/therapeutic use,Female,Gonorrhea/*drug therapy/epidemiology/*microbiology,Humans,Male,Neisseria gonorrhoeae,Neisseria gonorrhoeae/isolation {\&} purification/*me,antibiotic sensitivity,article,bacterial strain,bacterium isolate,cefixime,cefpodoxime,controlled study,data base,drug screening,female,gender,geography,human,male,meta analysis (topic),minimum inhibitory concentration,nonhuman,patient information,population research,systematic review",e87849,{Worldwide susceptibility rates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates to cefixime and cefpodoxime: A systematic review and meta-analysis},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L373071452 http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0087849 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=19326203{\&}id=doi:10.1371{\%}2Fjournal.pone.0087849{\&}atitle=Worldwid,9,2014,1,"From Duplicate 2 (Worldwide susceptibility rates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates to cefixime and cefpodoxime: a systematic review and meta-analysis - Yu, R X; Yin, Y; Wang, G Q; Chen, S C; Zheng, B J; Dai, X Q; Han, Y; Li, Q; Zhang, G Y; Chen, X)

In 2006, we showed that resistance to anti-tuberculosis drugs remained frequent in Sinaloa. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to describe drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) trends and to investigate the probability that patients acquire resistance to first-line anti-TB drugs on recurrence after treatment in Sinaloa. METHODS: Sputum specimens were collected from patients diagnosed with TB at all the health care institutions of Sinaloa during 1997-2005. Isolates were tested for susceptibility to first-line drugs. RESULTS: Among 671 isolates tested from 1997 to 2002, the overall resistance rate was 34.9{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 31.2-38.4) with a 1.2{\%} increase per year (Chi-square=4.258, p=0.03906). The prevalence of multi-drug resistance (MDR) was 17.9{\%} (95{\%} CI 14.9-20.7) with a 1.2{\%} increase per year (Chi-square=8.352, p=0.00385). Of 50 patients registered twice between 1997 and 2005, 15 were fully susceptible at first registration, of whom six (40{\%}) acquired drug resistance. Of 35 cases with any drug resistance at first registration, 21 (60{\%}) came to acquire resistance to at least one other drug. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of drug-resistant TB increased during 1997-2005 in Sinaloa.
