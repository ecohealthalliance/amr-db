1151,MAYBE,Aubry2014,Article,"Background: Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the major public health problems in Congo. However, data concerning Mycobacterium tuberculosis drug resistance are lacking because of the insufficient processing capacity. So, the aim of this study was to investigate for the first time the resistance patterns and the strain lineages of a sample of M. tuberculosis complex (MTBC) isolates collected in the two main cities of Congo. Methods: Over a 9-day period, 114 smear-positive sputa isolated from 114 patients attending centers for the diagnosis and treatment of TB in Brazzaville and Pointe Noire were collected for culture and drug susceptibility testing (DST). Detection of mutations conferring drug resistance was performed by using line probe assays (GenoType MTBDRplus and MTBDRsl) and DNA sequencing. Strain lineages were determined by MIRU-VNTR genotyping. Results: Of the 114 sputa, 46 were culture positive for MTBC. Twenty-one (46{\%}) were resistant to one or more first-line antiTB drugs. Of these, 15 (71{\%}) were multidrug resistant (MDR). The most prevalent mutations involved in rifampin and isoniazid resistance, D516V (60{\%}) in rpoB and S315T (87{\%}) in katG respectively, were well detected by MTBDRplus assay. All the 15 MDR strains were susceptible to fluoroquinolone and injectable second-line drug. No mutation was detected in the rrs locus involved in resistance to amikacin and capreomycin by both the MTBDRsl assay and DNA sequencing. By contrast, 9 MDR strains belonging to the same cluster related to T-family were identified as being falsely resistant to fluoroquinolone by the MTBDRsl assay due to the presence of a double substitution T80A-A90G in GyrA. Conclusions: Taken together, these data revealed a possible spread of a particular MDR clone in Congo, misidentified as fluoroquinolone resistant by MTBDRsl assay. Thus, this test cannot replace gold-standard culture method and should be interpreted carefully in view of the patient's native land.

2418,MAYBE,Borgia2012,Article,"BACKGROUND: New Delhi metallo-ss-lactamase (NDM) has emerged worldwide in clinically relevant gram-negative bacteria. We report an outbreak of NDM-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae in patients with no prior travel history to endemic regions. METHODS: Five NDM-1-producing K. pneumoniae colonizing and/or clinically infecting patients in a community tertiary hospital were detected between October and November 2011. NDM-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae (K. pneumoniae and Escherichia coli) were clinically and epidemiologically characterized, including susceptibility profiles, molecular typing, and molecular characterization of plasmids and resistant determinants. RESULTS: Five patients were identified carrying NDM-1-producing K. pneumoniae, all of them epidemiologically linked with each other. K. pneumoniae were confirmed to belong to the same clone, exhibiting multidrug-resistant phenotypes. One patient was positive for NDM-1-producing E. coli in blood and E. coli and K. pneumoniae in rectal specimens, both containing the same bla(NDM) plasmid, suggesting horizontal transfer between species in the patient. No environmental sources of these strains were found. Detection of positive isolates directly from rectal specimens allowed the rapid identification and isolation of colonized patients. CONCLUSIONS: We report a NDM-1-producing K. pneumoniae outbreak in Ontario, Canada. Implementation of standard infection control practices, including active screening was able to contain the spread of this organism in the hospital setting. Of concern is the potential loss of a travel history to identify patients that are at high risk of being colonized or infected with this organism and the lack of an accurate, cost-effective test that can be implemented in the hospital setting to identify these multidrug-resistant organisms.",S Borgia and O Lastovetska and D Richardson and A Eshaghi and J Xiong and C Chung and M Baqi and A McGeer and G Ricci and R Sawicki and R Pantelidis and D E Low and S N Patel and R G Melano,1058-4838,Clin Infect Dis,"*Disease Outbreaks,Aged,Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology,Carbapenems/*pharmacology,Cross Infection/epidemiology/microbiology,Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial,Female,Hospitals,Humans,Klebsiella Infections/epidemiology/*microbiology,Klebsiella pneumoniae/*drug effects/enzymology,Male,Middle Aged,Ontario/epidemiology,Rectum/microbiology,beta-Lactamases/genetics/*metabolism",e109--17,"{Outbreak of carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae containing blaNDM-1, Ontario, Canada}",NA,55,2012,11,"1537-6591Borgia, SergioLastovetska, OlgaRichardson, DavidEshaghi, AlirezaXiong, JianhuiChung, CatherineBaqi, MahinMcGeer, AllisonRicci, GloriaSawicki, RachaelPantelidis, RajniLow, Donald EPatel, Samir NMelano, Roberto GJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.S. Gov'tUnited StatesClin Infect Dis. 2012 Dec;55(11):e109-17. doi: 10.1093/cid/cis737.

3799,MAYBE,Chisholm2009,Article,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the origin of high-level azithromycin resistance that emerged in isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae in England and Wales in 2007, and to establish methods for identifying high-level azithromycin resistance. METHODS: The Gonococcal Resistance to Antimicrobials Surveillance Programme (GRASP) data from 2001-07 were examined for emerging trends in azithromycin susceptibility. Further to the identification of six high-level azithromycin-resistant isolates in GRASP 2007, an additional 102 isolates were selected on the basis of azithromycin susceptibility and geographic origin from the GRASP 2006 and 2007 collections. Susceptibility testing by Etest and disc diffusion was performed on all 108 isolates and 75 of these were typed by N. gonorrhoeae multiantigen sequence typing. RESULTS: A slight drift towards higher MICs of azithromycin was observed in the gonococcal population since 2001. Of greater concern was the first example of a shift to high-level resistance observed in six isolates in 2007. All six isolates were sequence type 649, which was not observed in any of the lower-level azithromycin-resistant isolates from 2007 or in any isolates tested from the same geographical locations. Contact tracing data for one patient suggested a link with Scotland. Disc diffusion testing of all 108 isolates showed that azithromycin, but not erythromycin, discs can differentiate between low-level and high-level resistance. CONCLUSIONS: High-level azithromycin resistance has emerged in England and Wales. Contact tracing and typing data suggest this may have originated from Scotland.

3956,YES,Chung2016a,Article,"Background: Mycotic anastomotic pseudoaneurysm of renal allograft artery is a rare complication of renal transplantation with less than 30 cases known to the literature. Aim: To report a rare case of mycotic pseudoaneurysm caused by multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and to review the literature for reported mycotic pseudoaneurysms regarding their causative agents and treatment modalities. Methods: We report a 42 year-old man with endstage renal failure due to diabetic nephropathy who had a renal transplant anastomosed to right external iliac artery and vein. He presented with right iliac fossa discomfort and fever 3 weeks post-operatively. CT scan showed a 3.8cmx3.5 cm pseudoaneurysm posteromedial to graft kidney. He underwent emergency graft excision and pseudoaneurysm resection with in-situ reversed long saphenous vein interposition graft. Aneurysm wall grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Subsequently he made good recovery on multiple antibiotics and haemodialysis. Literature search was conducted via Pubmed database using the keywords äóìmycotic pseudoaneurysmäóù, äóìrenal arteryäóù and äóìrenal transplantäóù. Exclusion criteria include non-mycotic pseudoaneurysms and pseudoaneurysms occurring outside the anastomosis between renal allograft artery and external iliac artery. Results: 28 cases of mycotic pseudoaneurysms were selected for review. Most require graft nephrectomy with only one successful case of conservative treatment. 82.1{\%} yielded fungus in the resected specimen.

4578,MAYBE,Dalal2015,Article,"Background: While the high burden of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) itself is a matter of great concern, the emergence and rise of advanced forms of drug-resistance such as extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) and extremely drug-resistant TB (XXDR-TB) is more troubling. The aim of this study was to investigate the trends over time of patterns of drug resistance in a sample of MDR-TB patients in greater metropolitan Mumbai, India. Methods: This was a retrospective, observational study of drug susceptibility testing (DST) results among MDR-TB patients from eight health care facilities in greater Mumbai between 2005 and 2013. We classified resistance patterns into four categories: MDR-TB, pre-XDR-TB, XDR-TB and XXDR-TB. Results: A total of 340 MDR-TB patients were included in the study. Pre-XDR-TB was the most common form of drug-resistant TB observed overall in this Mumbai population at 56.8{\%} compared to 29.4{\%}for MDR-TB. The proportion of patients with MDR-TB was 39.4{\%} in the period 2005-2007 and 27.8{\%} in 2011-2013, while the proportion of those with XDR-TB and XXDR-TB was changed from 6.1{\%} and 0{\%} respectively to 10.6{\%} and 5.6{\%} during the same time period. During the same periods, the proportions of patients with ofloxacin, moxifloxacin and ethionamide resistance significantly increased from 57.6{\%}to 75.3{\%}, from 60.0{\%} to 69.5{\%} and from 24.2{\%} to 52.5{\%}respectively (p{\textless}0.05). Discussion: The observed trends in TB drug-resistance patterns in Mumbai highlight the need for individualized drug regimens, designed on the basis of DST results involving first- and second-line anti-TB drugs and treatment history of the patient. A drug-resistant TB case-finding strategy based on molecular techniques that identify only rifampicin resistance will lead to initiation of suboptimal treatment regimens for a significant number of patients, which may in turn contribute to amplification of resistance and transmission of strains with increasingly advanced resistance within the community.",A Dalal and A Pawaskar and M Das and R Desai and P Prabhudesai and P Chhajed and S Rajan and D Reddy and S Babu and T K Jayalakshmi and P Saranchuk and C Rodrigues and P Isaakidis,1932-6203,PLoS ONE,",Adolescent,Adult,Aged,Antitubercular Agents/*pharmacology,Bacterial,Child,Drug Resistance,Ethionamide/pharmacology,Female,Fluoroquinolones/pharmacology,Humans,India,India/epidemiology,Infant,Male,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Middle Aged,Multidrug-Resistant/classification/*,Multiple,Mycobacterium tuberculosis,Mycobacterium tuberculosis/*drug effects/*isolatio,Ofloxacin/pharmacology,Precision Medicine,Preschool,Retrospective Studies,Tuberculosis,Young Adult,adolescent,adult,amikacin,aminosalicylic acid,antibiotic resistance,antibiotic sensitivity,article,capreomycin,child,clofazimine,ethionamide,extensively drug resistant tuberculosis,female,human,infant,isoniazid,kanamycin,levofloxacin,linezolid,major clinical study,male,moxifloxacin,multidrug resistant tuberculosis,nonhuman,observational study,ofloxacin,retrospective study,rifampicin,streptomycin,trend study",e0116798,{Resistance patterns among multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patients in greater metropolitan Mumbai: trends over time},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L601683548 http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0116798 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=19326203{\&}id=doi:10.1371{\%}2Fjournal.pone.0116798{\&}atitle=Resistan,10,2015,1,"From Duplicate 2 (Resistance patterns among multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patients in greater metropolitan Mumbai: trends over time - Dalal, A; Pawaskar, A; Das, M; Desai, R; Prabhudesai, P; Chhajed, P; Rajan, S; Reddy, D; Babu, S; Jayalakshmi, T K; Saranchuk, P; Rodrigues, C; Isaakidis, P)1932-6203Dalal, AlpaPawaskar, AkshayDas, MrinaliniDesai, RanjanPrabhudesai, PralhadChhajed, PrashantRajan, SujeetReddy, DeepeshBabu, SajitJayalakshmi, T KSaranchuk, PeterRodrigues, CamillaIsaakidis, PetrosJournal ArticleObservational StudyUnited StatesPLoS One. 2015 Jan 21;10(1):e0116798. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0116798. eCollection 2015.",10.1371/journal.pone.0116798,1/22/15,eng,25606853,YES,Allison,MAYBE,Brooke,Brooke,Brooke_1,YES,,

Sample size was calculated according to the population and WHO's estimated incidence of smear positive tuberculosis in the province/country. Sputum samples were obtained from 122 newly diagnosed patients of pulmonary tuberculosis from centres in Peshawar and Abbotabad in NWFP. RESULTS: Sensitivities were performed by proportion method which showed the following resistance values in 118 eligible patients: 15 (12.7{\%}) samples showed primary resistance to one or more drugs. 8 (6.4{\%}) isolates were resistant to a single drug, 2 (1.6{\%}) were resistant to 2 drugs, 4 (3.2{\%}) to 3 drugs, 1 (0.8{\%}) to 4 drugs while none to all 5 first line agents.

Within this diverse group, VIM-producing Enterobacter cloacae is increasingly reported in countries such as Greece and Spain. In this report, we evaluate the evidence for transmission of carbapenem-resistant E. cloacae in a cardiothoracic intensive care unit (CT-ICU). Methods: Clinical, infection control and microbiological data were collated. Clinical specimens were cultured by rountine methods. Patients (rectal swab) and the environment were screened for CRE. Isolates were identified by Vitek 2 and susceptibility testing was performed by CLSI disc diffusion. Evaluation for carbapenemase was conducted using the modified Hodge test (MHT), metallo-$\beta$-lactamase (MBL) Etest and synergy testing. PCR detection of carbapenemase genes and analysis of Xba1-restricted PFGE banding patterns were also performed. Results: Carbapenem-resistant E. cloacae were cultured from sternal wounds of 2 patients within a 6-day period. Both patients had received broad-spectrum antibiotics but neither had a history of recent travel. Their respective stays in the CT-ICU had overlapped for 11 days. Both were treated with appropriate antibiotics while aggressive infection control measures were instituted. CRE was not isolated from other patients, the hospital environment or medical equipment at that time. The isolates were resistant to $\beta$-lactams (including carbapenems), gentamicin and tobramycin, but susceptible to ciprofloxacin, amikacin and colistin. Phenotypic carbapenemase screening methods yielded positive but often inconsistent and subtle results. PCR confirmed the presence of blaVIM in both isolates, while PFGE demonstrated indistinguishable banding patterns. Conclusions: This is the first report of the emergence of VIM-producing E. cloacae in Ireland. Sternal wound infections by such organisms were also not previously reported. Clinical and molecular data indicated that cross-transmission of carbapenem-resistant E. cloacae in CT-ICU was likely.

Rectal swab samples were taken once in a month from a total of 180 patients who were hospitalized in the Surgery and Intensive Care Units, adult Oncology-Hematology and Pediatric Oncology Units between March-December 2006. The samples were cultivated onto bile-esculine agar media, and Miniapi system (bioMerieux, France) was used for the identification at species-level (Rapid ID 32 Strep kit, bioMerieux, France) and for the detection of antimicrobial susceptibilities (ATB Enterococcus kit, bioMerieux, France). MIC levels have been determined by the use of vancomycin E-test (AB Biodisk, Sweden) strips in brain-heart infusion agar (Merck, France). According to the culture results, 126 of the patients (70{\%}) have been found to be colonized with Enterococcus spp. The most frequently isolated species were as follows respectively; E. faecium (42{\%}), E. faecalis (31{\%}), E. avium (12{\%}), E. gallinarum (8{\%}) and E. casseliflavus, (5.6{\%}). Four of the E. faecium strains (3.2{\%}) were found resistant to vancomycin by both automated antibiotic susceptibility test system and E-test (MIC {\textgreater}256 mg/ml). Vancomycin-resistant strains have been identified as being VanA genotypes by polymerase chain reaction. Beta-lactamase production has not been detected in any one of the strains with the use of nitrocephin (Remel, U.S.A.) disk.

The isolate was identified using biochemical tests and Phoenixä‹¢ automated system and was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS). MICs of each antibiotic were determined by Etest. Screening for carbapenemase production was performed by the modified Hodge test and was confirmed by PCR amplification. Virulence factors were also studied. Plasmid replicon typing was used to classify Incompatibility (Inc) plasmids harbouring the resistance genes. The transferability of each plasmid was determined by conjugation using Escherichia coli J53. Finally, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was performed to determine the ST of the strain. The bacterial isolate was identified as K. pneumoniae and was named KPM2, carrying entB, ybtS, mrkD and ycfM virulence genes, but it did not overexpress OqxAB. Isolate KPM2 belonged to ST147 and was classified as resistant to all of the tested antibiotics with MICs above the clinical breakpoints. These resistances were due to production of OXA-48, CMY-2, TEM-1, CTX-M-15 and VEB-8 $\beta$-lactamases. Genetic and molecular studies showed that blaOXA-48 was embedded in transposon Tn1999.2 and was carried by a conjugative IncL/M plasmid of ca. 60 kb; blaVEB-8 was harboured on a conjugative IncA/C plasmid of ca. 120 kb.

Emergence of linezolid resistant clinical strains is a serious issue in the healthcare settings worldwide. We report here the molecular characterization of a linezolid resistant clinical isolate of Staphylococcus haemolyticus from India. Methods: The species of the clinical isolate was identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of linezolid, clindamycin, chloramphenicol and oxacillin were determined by E-test method. To elucidate the mechanism of linezolid-resistance, presence of cfr gene (chloramphenicol forfenicol resistance) and mutations in 23S rRNA and ribosomal proteins (L3, L4 and L22) were investigated. Staphylococcal Cassette Chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing was performed by multiplex PCR. Results: The study documented a rare clinical S. haemolyticus strain with three independent mechanisms of linezolid-resistance. The strain carried cfr gene, the only known transmissible mechanism of linezolid-resistance. The strain also possessed resistance-conferring mutations such as G2576T in domain V of 23S rRNA gene and Met156Thr in L3 ribosomal protein. The other ribosomal proteins (L4 and L22) did not exhibit mutations accountable for linezolid-resistance. Restriction digestion by NheI revealed that all the alleles of 23S rRNA gene were mutated. The isolate showed elevated MIC values ({\textgreater}256 $\mu$g ml-1) of linezolid, clindamycin, chloramphenicol and oxacillin. Methicillin resistance was conferred by type I SCCmec element. The strain also harboured lsa(B) gene which encodes an ABC transporter that can effux clindamycin. Interpretation {\&} conclusions: The present study reports the first clinical strain from India with transmissible and multiple mechanisms of linezolid-resistance.

Sporadic cases of NDM-1 positive strains have been reported from different countries suggesting a widespread dissemination. The aim of this study was to detection of Metallobeta- lactamases in gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients in Tehran hospitals. Methods: After specific identification tests, the susceptibility to the antibiotics was done by Kirby Bauer method and broth microdilution. Carbapenem resistant isolates were tested for carbapenemase production using modified Hodge test. Carbapenem resistant strains screened for blaKPC gene and genes encoding Metallo-beta-lactamases by using specific primers targeting blaNDM-1, blaVIM-1, blaVIM-2, blaIMP-1, blaIMP-2, and blaSPM. PCR products were sequenced in both directions. Results: Among 360 collected gram-negative isolates, 23 isolates (6.3{\%}) were resistant to meropenem, 11 isolates (3{\%}) were resistant to ertapenem, and four isolates (1.1{\%}) were resistant to imipenem. Majority of carbapenem resistant isolate were Klebsiella spp. (52.1{\%}) and Escherichia coli (39.1{\%}). Modified Hodge test was positive in 11 (47.8{\%}) of carbapenem resistant isolates showing carbapenemase production. Resistance to third-generation cephalosporins in this study was 65.7{\%} averagely. Of the cephalosporins, cefepime showed the highest activity against all species. In March 2011, we detected a multiple drug resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate that it was resistant to all tested antibiotics except colistin. PCR confirmed that this isolate contained blaNDM-1, blaTEM, blaSHV, and blaCTX-M. Modified Hodge test showed weakly positive result. MBL screening by E-test strips was positive. Class 1 Integron detected in this isolate after PCR using by specific primers. The nucleotide sequence of NDM- 1 gene was submitted to the GenBank databases under accession number JN664262. Conclusion: In this study, detection of blaTEM, blaSHV, blaNDM-1, and blaCTX-M combined with the mobility of class 1 integron in K. pneumoniae suggests that resistance to cephalosporins and carbapenems will continue and these resistances can easily transfer to many different gram negative bacteria.

From April 2010 to March 2012, 193 N. gonorrhoeae isolates were collected and the MICs (mug/ml) to six antimicrobials, including ceftriaxone, were determined. All isolates showed susceptibility to ceftriaxone and cefixime (MIC values, {\textless}0.5 mug/ml), and spectinomycin. The rates of resistance (intermediate susceptibility) to azithromycin, penicillin G, and ciprofloxacin were 3.6{\%} (19.7{\%}), 24.4{\%} (71.0{\%}), and 78.2{\%} (0.5{\%}), respectively. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) showed that 40.9{\%}, 19.2{\%}, and 17.1{\%} of isolates belonged to ST1901, ST7359, and ST7363, respectively.

Resistance to daptomycin or vancomycin among community-acquired MRSA clones is not well described in the literature. We herein report the first case of vancomycin-intermediate, daptomycin-nonsusceptible ST72-MRSA-IV. CASE PRESENTATION: A 45-year-old Japanese man underwent aortic arch prosthesis implantation for treatment of a dissecting aortic aneurysm. Fourteen months later, he developed a prosthetic graft infection of the aortic arch and an anterior mediastinal abscess caused by ST72-MRSA-IV. First-line treatment with vancomycin and rifampicin failed, and daptomycin was thus administered. After several days, the treatment was changed to linezolid because of the re-emergence of fever. The patient's condition resolved and no recurrence or other problems were seen for 1 year post-treatment. The infectious agent was definitively identified as vancomycin-intermediate, daptomycin-nonsusceptible, rifampicin-resistant ST72-MRSA-IV based on culture results and minimum inhibitory concentration testing. CONCLUSION: This case report illustrates the importance of fully understanding the changing epidemiology of infectious agents and the risk factors for the development of antibiotic resistance. Such information will help to minimize the emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant strains.
