730,MAYBE,Amissah2015,Article,"Background: Buruli ulcer (BU) is a skin infection caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. The wounds of most BU patients are colonized with different microorganisms, including Staphylococcus aureus. Methodology: This study investigated possible patient-to-patient transmission events of S. aureus during wound care in a health care center. S. aureus isolates from different BU patients with overlapping visits to the clinic were whole-genome sequenced and analyzed by a gene-by-gene approach using SeqSphere{\textless}sup{\textgreater}+{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} software. In addition, sequence data were screened for the presence of genes that conferred antibiotic resistance. Principal Findings: SeqSphere{\textless}sup{\textgreater}+{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} analysis of whole-genome sequence data confirmed transmission of methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and methicillin susceptible S. aureus among patients that took place during wound care. Interestingly, our sequence data show that the investigated MRSA isolates carry a novel allele of the fexB gene conferring chloramphenicol resistance, which had thus far not been observed in S. aureus.",N A Amissah and M A Chlebowicz and A Ablordey and A J Sabat and C S Tetteh and I Prah and T S {van der Werf} and A W Friedrich and J M {van Dijl} and J W Rossen and Y Stienstra,"1935-2735

10690,MAYBE,Kimura2008,Article,"Group B streptococci (GBS; Streptococcus agalactiae) are the leading cause of neonatal invasive diseases and are also important pathogens for adults. Penicillins are the drugs of first choice for the treatment of GBS infections, since GBS have been regarded to be uniformly susceptible to penicillins so far. Here we characterize the first strains of GBS with reduced penicillin susceptibility (PRGBS) identified in Japan. Fourteen PRGBS strains were clinically isolated from the sputa of elderly patients from 1995 to 2005; and the MICs of penicillin, oxacillin, and ceftizoxime ranged from 0.25 to 1 microg/ml, 2 to 8 microg/ml, and 4 to 128 microg/ml, respectively. Moreover, some strains were also insusceptible to ampicillin, cefazolin, cefepime, and cefotaxime. All the PRGBS isolates tested possessed a few amino acid substitutions adjacent to the conserved SSN and KSG motifs (amino acids 402 to 404 and 552 to 554, respectively) of PBP 2X, and the amino acid substitutions could be classified into two types, Q557E and V405A. Western blotting analysis of the 14 clinical isolates with anti-PBP 2X-specific serum suggested that the amount of PBP 2X among the 14 PRGBS isolates was reduced, although the 2 ATCC strains produced a significant amount of PBP 2X. The introduction of PRGBS-derived PBP 2X genes into penicillin-susceptible strains through allelic exchange elevated their penicillin insusceptibility, suggesting that these altered PBP 2X genes are responsible for the penicillin insusceptibility in PRGBS strains. In this study, we characterized for the first time PRGBS strains on a molecular basis, although several reports have so far mentioned the existence of beta-lactam-insusceptible GBS from a phenotypic standpoint.",K Kimura and S Suzuki and J Wachino and H Kurokawa and K Yamane and N Shibata and N Nagano and H Kato and K Shibayama and Y Arakawa,0066-4804,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,"Amino Acid Sequence,Amino Acid Substitution,Ampicillin/pharmacology,Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology,Bacterial Proteins/*genetics/metabolism,Blotting, Western,Cefotaxime/pharmacology,Ceftizoxime/pharmacology,Cephalosporins/pharmacology,Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field,Humans,Japan,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Molecular Sequence Data,Oxacillin/pharmacology,Penicillin Resistance/genetics,Penicillin-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism,Penicillins/*pharmacology,Sequence Analysis, DNA,Sequence Homology, Amino Acid,Streptococcal Infections/microbiology,Streptococcus agalactiae/*drug effects/genetics/me",2890--2897,{First molecular characterization of group B streptococci with reduced penicillin susceptibility},NA,52,2008,8,"1098-6596

We report here the first well-characterized case of severe life-threatening CA-MRSA infection in a child living in Rio de Janeiro city. The patient had many complications including hematogenous osteomyelitis and involvement of multiple sites requiring drainage of soft-tissue abscess, and pleural and pericardial empyema. The MRSA isolates recovered were genotyped using PFGE, SCC mec typing and multilocus sequence typing. Disk diffusion tests were performed following Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute recommendations. In addition, the presence of Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) was assessed by PCR amplification, using specific primers for lukF- pv (encoding for the F subunit of the PVL). The bacterial isolates were related to the ST30-SCC mecIV lineage (Oceania Southwest Pacific clone), a PVL producer CA-MRSA previously detected in Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil. Also, the isolates analyzed were susceptible to all non-$\beta$-lactam antibiotics tested. The present report demonstrates that disseminated CA-MRSA disease is also occurring in Rio de Janeiro.

About 20{\%} of the patients develop a recurrent infection after the primary episode. The aim of this study was to investigate microbial factors that may contribute to the recurrences of C. difficile infection (CDI). Methods: Thirty-five patients with a primary CDI were enrolled in this study. Faecal samples were collected at 1, 2, 4, 6 and 12 months after the primary infection and analysed for the presence of C. difficile and toxin B. All isolates were investigated by PCR-ribotyping and antimicrobial susceptibility. Results: The mean age of the 35 patients was 74 years and 20 were females and 15 males. Five of the patients died during the followup period due to underlying diseases not directly attributed to CDI. Seven patients harboured the same PCR-ribotype of C. difficile up to 6 months after the initial episode without diarrhoea. However, from four patients a new C. difficile PCR-ribotype was isolated after a period of negative samples. Patient 1 changed the ribotype from 001 to 020; patient 2 changed from 014 to 026; patient 3 changed from 014 to SE36, and patient 4 changed from 014 to 020 and then to 023. Four patients had PCR-ribotype 078 in their initial samples and the same isolate was also found in samples 2-4 months after the primary episode. No PCR-ribotype 027 was found in any samples. Fifty-eight isolates were analysed for antimicrobial susceptibility. All isolates were sensitive to metronidazole, vancomycin, tigecycline, fusidic acid, linezolid and fidaxomicin. Two isolates were resistant to moxifloxacin, tetracycline and rifampicin. Eighteen C. difficile isolates were resistant to clindamycin. Conclusion: Among the 35 patients enrolled in this study, 11 were positive for C. difficile after the initial episode. During the study period, 4/35 (11{\%}) changed the PCR-ribotype. These patients were reinfected with an other C. difficile ribotype. The 078 PCR-ribotype was isolated from four patients. No PCR-ribotype 027 was detected in any samples.

However, prior to implementation in a given setting, the association of specific mutations with specific drug resistance phenotypes should be evaluated. The purpose of this study was to evaluate molecular markers in predicting drug resistance in the Central Region of Cameroon. RESULTS: From April 2010 and March 2011, 725 smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis patients were enrolled and all positive cultures were tested for drug susceptibility. A total of 63 drug resistant and 100 drug sensitive Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex clinical isolates were screened for genetic mutations in katG, inhA, ahpC, rpoB, rpsL, rrs, gidB and embCAB loci using DNA sequencing. Of the 44 isoniazid resistant (INHR) isolates (24 high level, 1 mug/ml and 20 low level, 0.2 mug/ml), 73{\%} (32/44) carried the katG315 and/or the -15 inhA promoter mutations. Of the 24 high level INHR, 17 (70.8{\%}) harbored katG315 mutation, 1 a point mutation (-15C --{\textgreater} T) in the inhA promoter and 6 were (25.0{\%}) wild types. Thus, for INHR high level detection, katG315 mutation had a specificity and a sensitivity of 100{\%} and 70.8{\%} respectively. Of the 20 low level INHR, 10 (50.0{\%}) had a -15C --{\textgreater} T mutation in the inhA promoter region, and 1 (2.2{\%}) a -32G --{\textgreater} A mutation in the ahpC promoter region. All of the 7 rifampicin resistant (RIFR) isolates carried mutations in the rpoB gene (at codons Ser531Leu (71.4{\%}), His526Asp (14.3{\%}), and Asp516Val (14.3{\%})). Of the 27 streptomycin resistant (SMR) isolates, 7 carried mutations at the rpsL and the gidB genes. 1 of the 2 ethambutol resistant (EMBR) isolates displayed a mutation in embB gene. CONCLUSION: This study provided the first molecular investigation assessing the correlation of phenotypic to genotypic characteristics on MTB isolates from the Central Region of Cameroon using DNA sequencing. Mutations on rpoB, katG315 and -15 point mutations in inhA promoter loci could be used as markers for RIF and INH -resistance detection respectively.",E M Tekwu and L K Sidze and J P Assam and J C Tedom and S Tchatchouang and G G Makafe and A L Wetewale and C Kuaban and S Eyangoh and F Ntoumi and V N Beng and M Frank,1471-2180,BMC Microbiol,"*Drug Resistance, Bacterial,Antitubercular Agents/*pharmacology,Bacterial Proteins/*genetics,Cameroon,DNA, Bacterial/chemistry/genetics,Data Collection,Humans,Molecular Sequence Data,Mutation,Mycobacterium tuberculosis/*drug effects/*genetics,Promoter Regions, Genetic,Sequence Analysis, DNA,Tuberculosis/*microbiology",113,{Sequence analysis for detection of drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex isolates from the Central Region of Cameroon},NA,14,2014,NA,"1471-2180

Among the viridans group streptococci (VGS), there are major taxonomic changes by the addition of many new species; whereas, most of the new strains are of animal origin and only a few have been reported to be isolated from humans. Rare and unusual species of VGS such as Streptococcus thoraltensis, S. pluranimalium and S. hyointestinalis are normally associated with different animals. Their isolation from human being is not yet reported. AIM: To find out the rare and unusual species of viridans group streptococci from human oral cavity. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: A case-controlled study carried out at hospital-based dental services in a tertiary care hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Subgingival plaque samples of the tooth were collected from 80 patients (34 with periodontitis and 46 without periodontitis) undergoing tooth extraction. Cultures were subcultured onto special media such as Tryptone Soya blood Agar supplemented with strepto supplement and Mutans-Sanguis Agar. Identification of strains and antimicrobial susceptibilities were measured as minimum inhibitory concentration using Vitek 2 (BioMerieux, Paris, France) automated system. RESULTS: We have identified three strains of VGS - S. thoraltensis, S. pluranimalium and S. hyointestinalis from subgingival plaque samples from patients with periodontitis.

1614,YES,Barvalia2015,Article,"Introduction Hafnia Alvei is a type of strain belonging to genus Hafnia, a gram-negative bacterium that comprise of Enterobacteriaceae family. It can cause intra-abdominal infections and extraintestinal infections such as pneumonia, skin abscesses and septicemia. We report a case of a woman developing empyema and lung abscess from Hafnia Alvei post gastric bypass surgery. Case Presentation A 46-year-old female with diabetes mellitus type 2, systemic hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, morbid obesity underwent gastric bypass surgery. During postoperative period she developed a small anastomotic leak and complaint of chronic left sided chest pain. On CT scan, a 5.5 x 1.9 cm sub-diaphragmatic perisplenic abscess was discovered along with a tiny bubble of air and left sided pleural effusion. Due to close proximity to diaphragm and spleen abscess was amenable to drainage but treated with broad-spectrum intravenous vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactum for 3 weeks. Subsequent CT scans over 6-8 months showed increase in size of abscess and a new air fluid level inside the left sided pleural effusion. Further follow up imaging after a year revealed reduction in sub-diaphragmatic abscess but now a bronchopleural fistula and 5.9 cm lung abscess (see figure) was formed at left lung base. She was then started on intravenous ceftriaxone and azithromycin. Sputum sample showed pure culture of H. Alvei with resistance to ceftriaxone, tetracycline and ampicillin-sulbactum while susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, levofloxacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactum and aztreonam. Although there was slow resolution of abscess, new ground glass opacities and consolidation developed throughout left lung. Currently, she is being treated with intravenous meropenem and cardiothoracic surgery team is consulted. Discussion To our knowledge, this is a first case of Hafnia Alvei infection causing empyema from a perisplenic abscess after gastric bypass surgery. Being an enteric pathogen, alteration in bacterial flora is the most likely mechanism. One study showed H. alvei isolates from respiratory, gastrointestinal and urogenital tract however only 25{\%} (20 out of 80 samples) of all isolates were seen in pure cultures. In our case, antibiotic susceptibility was similar to isolates described in previous case reports except the resistance to 3rd generation cephalosporins.

Isolates were collected from across the Kingdom and phenotypically tested for carbapenemase production. Polymerase chain reaction detection of carbapenemase genes was also performed. Our results indicate that in Saudi Arabia, OXA-48 and NDM-1 are the dominant carbapenemases among Enterobacteriaceae with low prevalence of VIM. The latter is the most prevalent metallo-beta-lactamase in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, whereas oxacillinases, OXA-23 in particular, are the dominant carbapenemases in Acinetobacter baumannii. No KPC or IMP genes were detected. Our study is the first report of OXA-48, NDM-1, and VIM-4 enzymes in Enterobacter from the Kingdom.

22214,MAYBE,Wang2012l,Article,"Carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae has recently spread rapidly throughout China. In this study, we characterized a carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae isolate that produced both KPC-2 and IMP-4 type carbapenemases. A clinical isolate of K. pneumoniae, resistant to both meropenem and imipenem, was recovered from a urine sample. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined using the broth microdilution method and Etest (bioMerieux, France). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) were used for gene type analysis. bla (KPC) and the encoding genes of ESBLs and plasmid-mediated AmpC enzymes were polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified and sequenced. Plasmids were analyzed by transformation, enzyme restriction and Southern blot. PCR analysis revealed that the isolate was simultaneously carrying bla (KPC-2), bla (IMP-4), bla (TEM-1), and bla (OKP-B) genes. MLST assigned the isolate to a novel sequence type, ST476. bla (KPC-2)-harbouring plasmids of the isolate and comparative strains had similar EcoRI and HindIII restriction maps, while IMP-4-harbouring plasmids had variable HindIII restriction maps. Coexistence of bla (KPC-2) and bla (IMP-4) was probably due to bla (IMP-4)-harbouring plasmid transmission into KPC-2-producing K. pneumoniae (ST476).

5226,YES,Diene2011,Article,"Objective: Enterobacter aerogenes is a common and important human opportunistic pathogen that may cause a wide variety of nosocomial infections. In this study we report the complete genome sequence of an E. aerogenes strain isolated in our institution which showed successive resistance to all available antibiotics including imipenem and colistin in a patient who died from this infection despite antibiotic treatment. The aim of our study was to identify and decipher all resistance determinants of this pan-resistant isolate using genome sequencing approach. Method: Whole shotgun sequencing was used to fully sequence this genome. The shotgun libraries of 4 and 9 kb generated were analyzed and assembled using Phred-Phrap and Consed software suite. Genome annotation was performed using online bioserver RAST server (Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology). Standard PCR amplification and sequencing were used to improve sequence regions of low quality on genomic contigs and to characterize putative mutations on candidate genes involved in antibiotic resistance. Principal findings: The genome of E. aerogenes comprises a chromosomal DNA estimated at 5.37 Mb with a G+C content of 55{\%} and one circular plasmid of 162.182 bp in size. The functional annotation of the chromosome gave a total of 5113 predicted coding sequences (CDS) with 3197 (62.53{\%}) being assigned to a biological function including as many as 30 antibiotic resistance encoding genes, 49 antiseptic and heavy-metal resistance encoding genes and more than 100 efflux pump systems. Surprisingly, as compared to other available complete genomes, E. aerogenes genome appears to be more closely related to Klebsiella pneumoniae and not to E. cloacae species. Interestingly, the E. aerogenes conjugative plasmid carries many mobile genetic elements including antibiotic, antiseptics, and heavy metal resistance encoding genes. Finally, we report here the potential molecular mechanism of colistin resistance in this clinical isolate mediated by a single chromosome mutation (G157A) on pmrA gene as compared to a parental susceptible isolate in the PmrAB two-component regulatory system known to be involved in polymyxin resistance. Conclusion: Our study confirms that whole genome sequence is a critical approach to quickly decipher the resistome of any bacterium of clinical relevance.
