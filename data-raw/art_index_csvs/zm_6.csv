267,YES,Ahmed2008,Article,"Citrobacter freundii strain 4306 was isolated from a urine specimen of a patient in March 2006 in Palestine. This strain showed a unique multidrug resistance phenotype, as it was resistant both to 7-$\alpha$-methoxy- and oxyimino-cephalosporins, including cefepime, cefpirome and monobactams, in addition to quinolones, streptomycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Clavulanic acid did not act synergistically with cephalosporins by the double-disk synergy test. Molecular characterisation showed that the resistance to 7-$\alpha$-methoxy- and oxyimino-cephalosporins was due to a novel AmpC $\beta$-lactamase, designated CMY-37, with an isoelectric point of ∼9.0. CMY-37 is a variant of C. freundii chromosomal AmpC enzymes with at least seven amino acid substitutions. One of these substitutions, L316I, is located within the R2 loop that is considered the hotspot region responsible for the extended substrate spectrum in class C $\beta$-lactamases. The blaCMY-37 gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli TG1. CMY-37 is chromosomally encoded and is not associated with ISEcp1-like element. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that CMY-37 is the origin of many plasmid-mediated AmpC $\beta$-lactamases. This study highlights the emergence of cefepime and cefpirome resistance in C. freundii owing to a new type of AmpC $\beta$-lactamase. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. and the International Society of Chemotherapy.",A M Ahmed and T Shimamoto,"0924-8579 (Print)

We, therefore, aimed to delineate its current incidence, etiologic, clinical, laboratory spectra, and the effect of steroid therapy on the outcome. METHODOLOGY: Babies admitted from 1992 to 1995 in the Special Care Baby Unit of the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital, Maduguri, Nigeria, with bacterial meningitis were studied prospectively. Neonatal bacterial meningitis was confirmed if the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) microbiological, chemical, immunological and clinical criteria were satisfied. Detailed neurological follow-up was made. RESULT: Sixty-nine cases of neonatal bacterial meningitis were encountered, (25 were early-onset, and 44 late-onset); the incidence was 6.5/1000 live births. 22 Positive CSF cultures were grown in early-onset meningitis, and 28 in late-onset disease. Low birth weight showed higher risk of bacterial meningitis and it was significantly more likely in the preterm. X2 = 24.19, p = 0.000001). Gram-negative pathogens were more isolated (28/50, 56{\%}); Escherichia coli (11) being the commonest, while of the Gram-positive pathogens Staphylococcus aureus was most predominant overall (13/50). Concomitant blood culture was positive in 39/50 (78{\%}), inclusive of all 22 {""}definite{""} early-onset disease. The CSF WBC was minimally raised (25-30 x 10(6)/L) in 11 (22{\%}) of {""}definite{""} neonatal bacterial meningitis. Detection of unusual pathogens was noteworthy: N. meningitidis (2) and H. influenzae (2), contributing 0.6 and 2.2 per 1000 live births and admissions, respectively. Overall mortality was 24.6{\%}. Of the forty survivors, 9 (22.5{\%}) had neurological sequelae: sensorineural hearing deficit (3), hydrocephalus (2), subdural effusion (2), hemiparesis (1), afebrile (recurrent) seizure (1), and there was reduced developmental quotients at 24 months follow-up in 33. Dexamethasone therapy decreased mortality significantly; p = 0.0004. CONCLUSION: The new information highlighted by this research includes the lack of Group B Streptococcus isolation, the finding of S. pneumoniae, N. meningitidis, H. influenzae and S. aureus as significant pathogens, usefulness of blood cultures in the detection of neonatal bacterial meningitis, increasing resistance of Gram-positive neonatal pathogens to cloxacillin, low CSF WBC, and the finding that the adjunctive use of dexamethasone significantly decreases case fatality and neurological sequelae.",K I Airede and O Adeyemi and T Ibrahim,1119-3077 (Print),Niger J Clin Pract,"Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use,Anti-Inflammatory Agents/*therapeutic use,Dexamethasone/*therapeutic use,Female,Glucocorticoids/*therapeutic use,Humans,Incidence,Infant, Low Birth Weight,Infant, Newborn,Male,Meningitis, Bacterial/cerebrospinal fluid/*diagnos,Nigeria/epidemiology,Prospective Studies,Risk Factors",235--245,{Neonatal bacterial meningitis and dexamethasone adjunctive usage in Nigeria},NA,11,2008,3,"Airede, K I

415,MAYBE,Al-Obeid2010,Article,"Strain D958, a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin, was isolated from a 69-year-old Saudi male patient presenting with severe sepsis immediately after admission. Despite high serum levels of vancomycin, the same S. aureus strain was isolated from five blood culture sets during 1 week. Treatment failure under therapeutic levels of vancomycin prompted us to investigate the resistance profile of this strain in further detail. The MIC values for vancomycin as determined by Etest and microdilution were 3.0 and 2.0 mg/liter, respectively, and remained unchanged during the treatment course. The macro-Etest method showed a MIC of 4 mg/liter. The strain showed liquid vancomycin and lysostaphin MBCs of 2.0 and 5.0 mg/liter, respectively. The isolates were confirmed as heterogeneously vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (hVISA) by vancomycin population analysis profile. The areas under these curves were similar for Mu3 and D958 for vancomycin and teicoplanin (ratio values were 1 and 1.1 for vancomycin and teicoplanin, respectively). Extensive genotyping and molecular characterization demonstrated that the strain harbored a staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec element (SCCmec) type III cassette and was of sequence type ST241, a single-locus variant of the successful multiresistant clone ST239. Microarray results demonstrated that D958 contained numerous resistance determinants (generally plasmid or phage encoded). These results suggest that this strain is constitutively expressing an altered susceptibility to vancomycin. Further studies are warranted to assess the clonal distribution of such strains displaying reduced susceptibility to vancomycin prior to any antimicrobial therapy.",S Al-Obeid and Q Haddad and A Cherkaoui and J Schrenzel and P François and P Francois,0095-1137,J Clin Microbiol,",*Vancomycin Resistance,Aged,Anti-Bacterial Agents/analysis/*pharmacology/thera,Bacterial,Bacterial Typing Techniques,Bacterial/genetics,Blood/microbiology,Chromosomes,Cluster Analysis,DNA,DNA Fingerprinting,Genes,Genotype,Humans,Lysostaphin/pharmacology,Male,Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus/*drug,Microarray Analysis,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Microbial Viability/drug effects,Plasmids,Saudi Arabia,Sepsis/*microbiology,Serum/chemistry,Staphylococcal Infections/*microbiology,Staphylococcus aureus,Teicoplanin/pharmacology,Vancomycin/analysis/*pharmacology/therapeutic use,abdominal pain,aged,antimicrobial therapy,area under the curve,article,asthma,bacterium detection,bacterium isolate,blood culture,brain hemorrhage,case report,chemical structure,chromosome,ciprofloxacin,clindamycin,cotrimoxazole,drug sensitivity,drug substitution,erythromycin,fever,fusidic acid,genotype,gentamicin,heart failure,human,hypertension,kidney failure,levofloxacin,linezolid,lysostaphin,male,meropenem,meticillin,minimum inhibitory concentration,penicillin G,priority journal,purification,rifampicin,sepsis,systolic dysfunction,teicoplanin,tigecycline,treatment duration,treatment failure,vancomycin",2199--2204,{First detection of an invasive Staphylococcus aureus strain (D958) with reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides in Saudi Arabia},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L358912807 http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/JCM.00954-09 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=00951137{\&}id=doi:10.1128{\%}2FJCM.00954-09{\&}atitle=First+detection+of+an+in,48,2010,6,"From Duplicate 1 (First detection of an invasive Staphylococcus aureus strain (D958) with reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides in Saudi Arabia - Al-Obeid, S; Haddad, Q; Cherkaoui, A; Schrenzel, J; Francois, P)

598,MAYBE,Almyroudis2011,Article,"OBJECTIVE: To study the molecular epidemiology of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) colonization and to identify modifiable risk factors among patients with hematologic malignancies. SETTING: A hematology-oncology unit with high prevalence of VRE colonization. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with hematologic malignancies and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients admitted to the hospital. METHODS: Patients underwent weekly surveillance by means of perianal swabs for VRE colonization and, if colonized, were placed in contact isolation. We studied the molecular epidemiology in fecal and blood isolates by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis over a 1-year period. We performed a retrospective case-control study over a 3-year period. Cases were defined as patients colonized by VRE, and controls were defined as patients negative for VRE colonization. Case patients and control patients were matched by admitting service and length of observation time. RESULTS: Molecular genotyping demonstrated the primarily polyclonal nature of VRE isolates. Colonization occurred at a median of 14 days. Colonized patients were characterized by longer hospital admissions. Previous use of ceftazidime was associated with VRE colonization (P {\textless} .001), while use of intravenous vancomycin and antibiotics with anaerobic activity did not emerge as a risk factor. There was no association with neutropenia or presence of colonic mucosal disruption, and severity of illness was similar in both groups. CONCLUSION: Molecular studies showed that in the majority of VRE-colonized patients the strains were unique, arguing that VRE acquisition was sporadic rather than resulting from a common source of transmission. Patient-specific factors, including prior antibiotic exposure, rather than breaches in infection control likely predict for risk of fecal VRE colonization.",N G Almyroudis and A J Lesse and T Hahn and G Samonis and P A Hazamy and K Wongkittiroch and E S Wang and P L {McCarthy Jr.} and M Wetzler and B H Segal and P L McCarthy and M Wetzler and B H Segal,0899-823x,Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology,",*Vancomycin Resistance,80 and over,Adolescent,Adult,Aged,Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use,Bacterial/analysis,Case-Control Studies,Child,Cross Infection/*complications/*epidemiology/trans,DNA,Electrophoresis,Enterococcus/*genetics/isolation {\&} purification,Female,Gel,Genotype,Gram-Positive Bacterial,Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications,Hodgkin disease,Humans,Infections/complications/*epidemiology/microbiolog,Length of Stay,Male,Middle Aged,Molecular Epidemiology,Preschool,Pulsed-Field,Retrospective Studies,Risk Factors,Young Adult,acute lymphoblastic leukemia,acute myeloblastic leukemia,adolescent,adult,aged,anaerobic capacity,article,bacteremia,bacterial colonization,bacterium isolate,blood analysis,case control study,catheter infection,ceftazidime,child,chronic lymphatic leukemia,chronic myeloid leukemia,clindamycin,clinical article,clinical observation,controlled study,diarrhea,disease course,disease surveillance,febrile neutropenia,feces analysis,female,graft recipient,hematologic malignancy,hematopoietic stem cell transplantation,hospital admission,human,imipenem,length of stay,leukocyte count,leukopenia,liquid feces,male,meropenem,metronidazole,molecular epidemiology,multiple myeloma,myelodysplastic syndrome,myeloproliferative disorder,neutropenia,neutrophil count,nonhodgkin lymphoma,nonhuman,piperacillin plus tazobactam,preschool child,prevalence,pulsed field gel electrophoresis,retrospective study,risk factor,school child,tobramycin,treatment outcome,vancomycin,vancomycin resistant Enterococcus",490--496,{Molecular epidemiology and risk factors for colonization by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus in patients with hematologic malignancies},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L361687704 http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/659408 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=0899823X{\&}id=doi:10.1086{\%}2F659408{\&}atitle=Molecular+epidemiology+and+risk+fact,32,2011,5,"From Duplicate 2 (Molecular epidemiology and risk factors for colonization by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus in patients with hematologic malignancies - Almyroudis, N G; Lesse, A J; Hahn, T; Samonis, G; Hazamy, P A; Wongkittiroch, K; Wang, E S; McCarthy Jr., P L; Wetzler, M; Segal, B H)

Methods: We conducted a case-control study defining cases as persons living or working in Saxony-Anhalt diagnosed with the O4 non-agglutinating strain between January and March 2013. We selected two controls contemporarily reported with norovirus infection, frequencymatched on residence and age group, per case. We interviewed regarding food consumption, especially pork and its place of purchase. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) with 95{\%} confidence intervals (95{\%} CI) using logistic regression. The NRC investigated human and food isolates by PCR, SDS-PAGE, MLST, PFGE, MLVA and susceptibility testing. Results: Altogether, 68 O4 non-agglutinating human isolates were confirmed between January and April 2013. Of those, 61 were assigned to the outbreak (median age 57 years, 44{\%} female); 83{\%} cases ≥ 60 years were hospitalized. Eating raw minced pork from butcheries within 3 days was associated with disease (31 cases, 28 controls; OR adjusted for sex: 3.6; 95{\%} CI: 1.0-13). Phage type DT193 and MLST ST34 were assigned, and isolates' lipopolysaccharide (LPS) matched control strains. Isolates linked to Saxony-Anhalt exhibited PFGE type 5. ASSuT- and ACSSuT phenotype proportions were 34 and 39{\%} respectively; 54{\%} were resistant to chloramphenicol. Three pork isolates matched the outbreak strain. Discussion: Raw minced pork was the most likely infection vehicle in this first reported outbreak caused by O4 non-agglutinating, mostly chloramphenicol-resistant S. Typhimurium DT193. High hospitalization proportions demand awareness on the risk of consumption of raw pork among elderly. LPS analysis indicated O4 expression; therefore, testing with antisera from different lots is recommendable in unexpected agglutination reactions.",K Alt and S Simon and C Helmeke and C Kohlstock and R Prager and E Tietze and W Rabsch and I Karagiannis and D Werber and C Frank and A Fruth,1932-6203,PLoS ONE,"Germany,O4 non agglutinating Salmonella typhimurium,Salmonella,adult,age distribution,aged,antibiotic resistance,antibiotic sensitivity,article,bacterial strain,bacterium isolate,bacterium lipopolysaccharide,case control study,chloramphenicol,controlled study,epidemic,female,food intake,food safety,human,interview,major clinical study,male,nonhuman,norovirus infection,pork,residential area,salmonellosis",NA,"{Outbreak of uncommon O4 non-agglutinating Salmonella typhimurium linked to Minced Pork, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany, January to April 2013}",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L604923625 http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0128349 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=19326203{\&}id=doi:10.1371{\%}2Fjournal.pone.0128349{\&}atitle=Outbreak,10,2015,6,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,MAYBE,Cale,YES,Ayomide,Ayomide,Zach,yes,,

While the prevalence of fluoroquinolone-resistant S. pyogenes isolates has been increasing since 2000 in the USA and Europe, it has remained very low in Japan. We isolated a fluoroquinolone-resistant S. pyogenes strain and analysed its genetics. Methods: TU-296, a strain of S. pyogenes resistant to levofloxacin (MIC 16 mg/L), was isolated from the throat of a patient in their thirties with pharyngitis in autumn 2007. We carried out susceptibility tests for various antimicrobial agents and PCR analysis of the genes gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE in the quinolone resistance-determining region, followed by sequencing of the PCR products to find mutation(s) and the resulting amino acid substitution(s). We then sequenced the PCR product of the emm gene and determined the emm genotype. Results: S. pyogenes TU-296 was found to have the following mutations and amino acid substitutions: adenine 476 to cytosine in gyrA and cytosine 367 to thymine in parC, resulting in Glu-85→Ala in GyrA and Ser-79→Phe in ParC. The genotype of the isolate was emm11. Conclusions: Amino acid substitutions in fluoroquinolone-resistant S. pyogenes have already been reported from Europe and the USA, including Ser-81→Phe or Tyr and Met-99→Leu in GyrA, as well as Ser-79→Phe, Tyr or Ala and others in ParC. Numerous point mutations were found in parC and parE of S. pyogenes TU-296. In addition, a new amino acid substitution was detected (Glu-85→Ala in GyrA). To our knowledge, there have been no previous reports of this substitution in a clinical isolate of S. pyogenes. {\textcopyright} The Author 2010.

Methods We describe the contact tracing investigation undertaken after the presentation of an adult with XDR-TB. Active cases were treated with an XDR-TB drug regimen and contacts underwent a programme of follow-up for 2 years. All isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) were assessed early using whole genome sequencing (WGS) as well as routine drug susceptibility testing (DST). Results Thirty-three contacts were screened. In the first year one confirmed and one probable case were identified through contact tracing. A further possible case was identified through epidemiological links. Two confirmed cases were identified through WGS 2 years later. Twenty-five (80{\%}) contacts without evidence of tuberculosis were adherent to 1 year of follow-up and 14 (45{\%}) were adherent to 2 years of follow-up.

Objectives: To describe the epidemiologic profile of nosocomial infections caused by K. pneumoniae. Methods: A prospective surveillance study was performaed at a university hospital of Sahloul (Sousse-Tunisia) from july 2011 to march 2012. K. pneumoniae isolates were identified in the clinical laboratory by biochemical tests and the Analytical Profile index procedure (API 20-NE - Biom{\'{e}}rieux, France). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by standardized methods recommended by the National Committee of Clinical Laboratory Standards. Occurrence of beta-lactamases was detected by PCR amplification and sequencing of ESBL genes (blaTEM, blaSHV, blaCTX-M) and carbapenemase genes (blaOXA-48). ERICPCRgenotyping were used to assess genetic heterogeneity between the isolates. MIC determinations for carbapenems were performed by Etest (bioM{\'{e}}rieux). Results: Forty three strains were collected from 43 patients admitted in the ICU and the urology service. The repeat isolates were excluded from the study. All the patients in our study have had indwelling intravascular devices or were exposed to invasive procedures. During the study period two epidemic periods was declared: the first one occurred between august and September 2011 and the second between December and February 2012. Antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of all clinical isolates revealed four different profiles based on sensivity patterns against fosfomycin, colistin, co-trimxazole, tygecyclin and aminosides. PCR and sequencing analysis revealed that the isolates harbored the blaCTX gene, the blaSHV and the blaOXA-48 gene. Conclusion: There is a serious need to accentuate on the rational use of antimicrobials and strictly adhere to the concept of the “reserve drug” to minimize the misuse of available antimicrobials. In addition regular antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance, knowledge and its application is essential to reduced current drug resistance rate in hospital as well as in community, in addition to the implementation of basic hygiene precautions.",O Bouallègue and N Jaidane and L Dhidah and A Masoudi and N Boujaafar,2047-2994,Antimicrobial Resistance and Infection Control,"France,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Tunisia,antibiotic sensitivity,antiinfective agent,beta lactamase,carbapenem derivative,carbapenemase,clinical laboratory,colistin,community,devices,drug resistance,epidemic,epsilometer test,extended spectrum beta lactamase,fosfomycin,gene,genetic heterogeneity,hospital,hospital infection,human,hygiene,infection control,invasive procedure,minimum inhibitory concentration,patient,prevention,procedures,university hospital,urology",NA,{Incidence of carbapenemase-producing Klebsialla pneumoniae at the University Hospital of Salloul (Sousse-Tunisia)},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L72036314 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=20472994{\&}id=doi:{\&}atitle=Incidence+of+carbapenemase-producing+Klebsialla+pneumoniae+at+the+University+Hospital+,2,2013,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,YES,Allison,YES,Nchedo,Nchedo,Zach,yes,,
2711,YES,Brunel2012,Article,"Objectives: An increasing number of human infections with livestockassociated Staphylococcus aureus sequence type (ST) 398 has been recently reported. Here, S. aureus ST398 isolated from patients, health care workers (HCW) and environmental samples in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of Montpellier Hospital were characterized with the aim to understand the circulation of this pathogen into the ICU. Methods: One hundred and twenty-five S. aureus were isolated between February and June 2011 in the ICU from patients, HCWs and environment, and typed by MultiLocus Sequence typing (MLST). S. aureus ST398 strains were analyzed by double-locus sequence typing (DLST) and accessory gene regulation (agr) typing. Resistance to antibiotics was detected by disk-diffusion method. Macrolidelincosamide- streptogramin type B (MLSB) resistant strains were screened by PCR for erm(A), erm(C), erm(T) and msr(A) genes. Virulence genes were detected by specific PCRs. Results: Out of the 125 isolates, 29 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) ST398 or variant were isolated in nasal carriage and invasive diseases in five patients (n = 12), nasal colonization of two HCWs (n = 2) and environmental samples (n = 15). For the first time, four isolates were identified as variant of ST 398 with a mutation in the pta gene. All isolates were agr1 and DLST-type 144-186. Erythromycin resistance and inducible MLSB phenotype were observed for 76{\%} of the isolates. Seven environmental isolates showed additional resistance to Kanamycin, Tobramycin and Gentamicin. All strains harbored the erm(T) gene and different combinations of erm(A) and erm(C) and the absence of msr(A). No isolate contained the genes encoding the Panton Valentine Leukocidin, TSST-1 and Staphylococcal Enterotoxin A. No history of contact with livestock was identified in patients and HCWs. Two patients presented nosocomial pneumonia after acquired-nasal colonization. Conclusion: Isolation of MSSA ST398 strains in patients, HCWs and environment in an ICU during short time period underlines the capacity of this emerging pathogen to rapid person-to-person transmission and the role of the environment as potential reservoir. Despite the absence of large antibiotic resistance and virulence traits, MSSA ST398 can lead to severe infections in critically ill patients.

Methods: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed and resistance genes were characterized by PCR amplification and sequencing. The Modified Hodge Test (MHT), MBL E-test, EDTA and boronic acid combined disk diffusion method, and a disk enzymatic assay were performed for the screening of carbapenemases. Results: For K. pneumoniae, MICs of carbapenems were as follows (mg) L) ertapenem 8, meropenem 1, imipenem 0.25 and doripenem 0.5. This isolate demonstrated positive results in the ESBL, EDTA and APBA combine tests, and disk enzymatic assay. PCR and sequencing revealed the presence of, blaOXA-51 and blaCTX-M-15 beta-lactamase genes. For E. coli, MICs of carbapenems were as follows (mg/L) ertapenem and meropenem 0.06, imipenem 2 and doripenem 0.25. E. coli strain showed positive results in the ESBL, MHT and disk enzymatic assay tests. PCR and sequencing revealed the presence of, blaOXA-58 and blaCTX-M-15 beta-lactamase genes.

The Staphylococcus capitis clone NRCS-A has been previously described as an emerging cause of nosocomial bacteraemia in French neonatal intensive-care units (NICUs). In this study, we aimed to explore the possible unrecognized dissemination of this clone on a larger geographical scale. One hundred methicillin-resistant S. capitis strains isolated from neonates (n = 86) and adult patients (n = 14) between 2000 and 2013 in four different countries (France, Belgium, the UK, and Australia) were analysed with SmaI pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and dru typing. The vast majority of NICU strains showed the NRCS-A pulsotype and the dt11c type (96{\%}). We then randomly selected 14 isolates (from neonates, n = 12, three per country; from adult patients, n = 2), considered to be a subset of representative isolates, and performed further molecular typing (SacII PFGE, SCCmec typing, and multilocus sequence typing-like analysis), confirming the clonality of the S. capitis strains isolated from neonates, despite their distant geographical origin. Whole genome single-nucleotide polymorphism-based phylogenetic analysis of five NICU isolates (from the different countries) attested to high genetic relatedness within the NRCS-A clone. Finally, all of the NRCS-A strains showed multidrug resistance (e.g. methicillin and aminoglycoside resistance, and decreased vancomycin susceptibility), with potential therapeutic implications for infected neonates. In conclusion, this study represents the first report of clonal dissemination of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus clone on a large geographical scale.

S. penumoniae is a germ that produces a wide variety of diseases, although the most serious infections are in respiratory tract and meningitis. Most patients with the infection caused by this microorganism have a good response to the treatment. The cases with bad prognosis and those which are eventually lethal are related to host factors and microbiologic characteristics such as resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. The aim of this paper is to inform on three cases of fulminant meningitis due to S. pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, which presented neurological focalization, acute loss of consciousness, coma, and death within the first week, in spite of treatment with cephalosporin of third and fourth generation. In all these cases, S. pneumoniae was isolated from cerebrospinal fluid.

The increase in meningitis caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii has resulted in a significant reduction in available treatment options. CASE REPORT AND LITERATURE REVIEW: We report the case of a 36-year-old man with a complex craniofacial trauma, who developed a nosocomial meningitis due to MDR A. baumannii that was cured by intrathecal colistin. The case is contextualized among all the published cases of Acinetobacter meningitis treated with topical colistin found through a MEDLINE search of the literature. To date, including the present case, eight reported cases of Acinetobacter meningitis have been treated with colistin administered by an intrathecal route and 24 by an intraventricular route. The daily dose of colistin used ranged from 1.6 mg every 24 h to 20 mg every 24 h in adult patients. The median time necessary to obtain cerebrospinal fluid sterilization was 4.1 days, and treatment was always successful even if in two cases Acinetobacter meningitis relapsed. Toxicity probably or possibly related to the topical administration of colistin was noted in five out of the 32 patients.

In addition, there is a lack of information pertaining to resistance to macrolide, lincosamide and streptogramin type B (MLS(B)) in developing countries, including Mexico. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of resistance to MLS(B) antibiotics in isolates of S. epidermidis obtained in the General Hospital of Acapulco in Mexico. Susceptibility to erythromycin, clindamycin and quinupristin-dalfopristin was tested by a diffusion test, and MICs to oxacillin, erythromycin and lincomycin were determined. Differentiation between MLS(B) phenotypes was performed by a double disc diffusion test. A total of 38 of the 47 strains of S. epidermidis isolated from nosocomial infections were resistant to oxacillin [meticillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE)]. The phenotypes obtained were: 18 constitutive MLS(B), 3 inducible MLS(B), 6 macrolide streptogramin and 4 lincosamide; 7 strains were susceptible to MLS(B) antibiotics. The genes associated with resistance were detected by PCR. Genotyping showed a predominance of the ermA gene followed by genes ermC and msrA. The frequency of the genes detected varied slightly from results that have been reported in isolates from other countries. Clonal types were identified by PFGE and revealed the dissemination of two major clones of MRSE in the Mexican hospital.

DESIGN: We examined genotypic drug resistance patterns using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and the degree of molecular clustering using 24-locus mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units-variable number of tandem repeats (MIRU-VNTR) among 199 consecutive pulmonary TB patients in Jayapura, Papua. RESULTS: Drug resistance mutations were present in 30/198 (15.2{\%}) patients: 16/144 (11.1{\%}) primary cases and 14/51 (27.5{\%}) retreatment cases. Genotypic resistance to rifampicin was found in 15 (7.6{\%}) patients, to isoniazid in 19 (9.6{\%}), to ethambutol in 7 (3.5{\%}), and to streptomycin and second-line injectable drugs in 5 (2.5{\%}) patients. Eight (4.0{\%}) patients had multidrug-resistant TB, while no mutations were found for fluoroquinolones. The most common lineage found among all isolates was East-African Indian (n = 66, 33.7{\%}), followed by Euro-American (n = 38, 19.4{\%}). Drug resistance mutations were more common among Beijing strains than other lineages. Of the 30 drug-resistant isolates, 12 (40.0{\%}) fell into four clusters that were separate from drug-susceptible clusters as determined using MIRU-VNTR.

Aims: The aim of this study was to characterize pAmpC $\beta$-lactamase producing extraintestinal E. coli, their phylogenetic distribution, resistance pattern, treatment options, and impact on patient's clinical outcome. Settings and Design: This descriptive study was carried out in a multi-specialty tertiary care hospital. Materials and Methods: A total of 300 clinically significant, non-repeat isolates were studied. AmpC disk test was used for phenotypic AmpC-$\beta$-lactamase detection. Molecular types of pAmpC were determined by a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Phylogenetic analysis was performed by triplex PCR methods. Metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) detection was done by E test. Antibiogram, treatment, and clinical outcome were collected in a structured proforma. Results: Although 95 isolates (32{\%}) were phenotypically positive for AmpC, PCR detected CIT type of AmpC gene in only 37 isolates. Majority of strains were from phylogroup A (85{\%}) and B1 (58{\%}) which are considered as commensal groups. Co-production of ESBL's was observed in 33 strains and 5 strains were found to be MBL producers. Most widely prescribed antibiotics were 3 rd generation cephalosporins (30{\%}), carbapenems (19{\%}) and aminoglycosides (16{\%}). Conclusions: Plasmid mediated AmpC producing isolates were found to exhibit a high degree of drug resistance, and they mainly belonged to commensal strains possibly due to misuse of antibiotics. Proper antibiotic policy is required to limit the spread of pAmpC producers or else it will lead to a therapeutic dead end in the near future.",A Chakraborty and P Adhikari and S Shenoy and V Saralaya,"0974-5130

Analysis of this strain by the disk diffusion test revealed synergies between clavulanic acid and ceftazidime, cefotaxime. Clavulanic acid decreased the MICs of ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone, which suggested that LBT04 produced an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. These resistances were carried by a 1080-bp chromosomal gene that encoded a beta-lactamase with a pI of 6.3.

The objective of this work is to summarize the current incidence and spectrum of carbapenemase producers in the Czech Republic. Methods: All blood isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been sent to the National Reference Laboratory for Antibiotics since 2005 for the purpose of EARS-Net survey. Moreover, Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter baumannii isolates resistant to meropenem or imipenem according to the CLSI or EUCAST criteria were sent to the NRL for Antibiotics and/or to the Pilsen laboratory for confirmation of resistance to carbapenems. The approximation disk test was used to detect MBLs, KPCs and AmpC enzymes. Carbapenemase activity was formerly confirmed by imipenem spectrophotometric hydrolysis assay and recently by MALDI-TOF MS hydrolysis assay. Identification of carbapenemase was performed by PCR followed by amplicon sequencing. MLST was performed in Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii isolates. Results: The most of the analysed isolates were resistant to the carbapenems due to the porin mechanism. Carbapenemase production has been confirmed in minority of the cases. The KPC-2 carbapenemase was firstly detected in K. pneumoniae (ST258) isolated from a patient repatriated from Greece, followed by KPC-3- producing K. pneumoniae (ST515) from a patient previously hospitalized in Italy. VIM-1 metallo-beta-lactamase was detected in two strains of Serratia marcescens isolated independently in two hospitals and also in K. pneumoniae isolates. VIM-1-producing K. pneumoniae has been responsible for local outbreaks in one hospital in Prague. In spring 2011, the first NDM-1 producer was observed in the Czech Republic. NDM-1 was detected in Acinetobacter baumannii (ST1) isolated from a patient repatriated from Hurghada, Egypt. Metallo-beta-lactamase-producing P. aeruginosa isolates (VIM-2, IMP-7) have been detected in at least seven hospitals causing local outbreaks.

4092,MAYBE,Cohen2015b,Article,"BACKGROUND: The continued advance of antibiotic resistance threatens the treatment and control of many infectious diseases. This is exemplified by the largest global outbreak of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB) identified in Tugela Ferry, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, in 2005 that continues today. It is unclear whether the emergence of XDR-TB in KwaZulu-Natal was due to recent inadequacies in TB control in conjunction with HIV or other factors. Understanding the origins of drug resistance in this fatal outbreak of XDR will inform the control and prevention of drug-resistant TB in other settings. In this study, we used whole genome sequencing and dating analysis to determine if XDR-TB had emerged recently or had ancient antecedents. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We performed whole genome sequencing and drug susceptibility testing on 337 clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis collected in KwaZulu-Natal from 2008 to 2013, in addition to three historical isolates, collected from patients in the same province and including an isolate from the 2005 Tugela Ferry XDR outbreak, a multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolate from 1994, and a pansusceptible isolate from 1995. We utilized an array of whole genome comparative techniques to assess the relatedness among strains, to establish the order of acquisition of drug resistance mutations, including the timing of acquisitions leading to XDR-TB in the LAM4 spoligotype, and to calculate the number of independent evolutionary emergences of MDR and XDR. Our sequencing and analysis revealed a 50-member clone of XDR M. tuberculosis that was highly related to the Tugela Ferry XDR outbreak strain. We estimated that mutations conferring isoniazid and streptomycin resistance in this clone were acquired 50 y prior to the Tugela Ferry outbreak (katG S315T [isoniazid]; gidB 130 bp deletion [streptomycin]; 1957 [95{\%} highest posterior density (HPD): 1937-1971]), with the subsequent emergence of MDR and XDR occurring 20 y (rpoB L452P [rifampicin]; pncA 1 bp insertion [pyrazinamide]; 1984 [95{\%} HPD: 1974-1992]) and 10 y (rpoB D435G [rifampicin]; rrs 1400 [kanamycin]; gyrA A90V [ofloxacin]; 1995 [95{\%} HPD: 1988-1999]) prior to the outbreak, respectively. We observed frequent de novo evolution of MDR and XDR, with 56 and nine independent evolutionary events, respectively. Isoniazid resistance evolved before rifampicin resistance 46 times, whereas rifampicin resistance evolved prior to isoniazid only twice. We identified additional putative compensatory mutations to rifampicin in this dataset. One major limitation of this study is that the conclusions with respect to ordering and timing of acquisition of mutations may not represent universal patterns of drug resistance emergence in other areas of the globe. CONCLUSIONS: In the first whole genome-based analysis of the emergence of drug resistance among clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis, we show that the ancestral precursor of the LAM4 XDR outbreak strain in Tugela Ferry gained mutations to first-line drugs at the beginning of the antibiotic era. Subsequent accumulation of stepwise resistance mutations, occurring over decades and prior to the explosion of HIV in this region, yielded MDR and XDR, permitting the emergence of compensatory mutations. Our results suggest that drug-resistant strains circulating today reflect not only vulnerabilities of current TB control efforts but also those that date back 50 y. In drug-resistant TB, isoniazid resistance was overwhelmingly the initial resistance mutation to be acquired, which would not be detected by current rapid molecular diagnostics employed in South Africa that assess only rifampicin resistance.",K A Cohen and T Abeel and A {Manson McGuire} and C A Desjardins and V Munsamy and T P Shea and B J Walker and N Bantubani and D V Almeida and L Alvarado and S B Chapman and N R Mvelase and E Y Duffy and M G Fitzgerald and P Govender and S Gujja and S Hamilton and C Howarth and J D Larimer and K Maharaj and M D Pearson and M E Priest and Q Zeng and N Padayatchi and J Grosset and S K Young and J Wortman and K P Mlisana and M R O'Donnell and B W Birren and W R Bishai and A S Pym and A M Earl,1549-1277,PLoS Med,"*Genome, Bacterial,Adult,Antitubercular Agents/*pharmacology,Disease Outbreaks,Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis/drug thera,Female,Humans,Male,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Mutation,Mycobacterium tuberculosis/drug effects/*genetics/,Sequence Analysis, DNA,South Africa/epidemiology",e1001880,{Evolution of Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis over Four Decades: Whole Genome Sequencing and Dating Analysis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Isolates from KwaZulu-Natal},NA,12,2015,9,"1549-1676

4122,MAYBE,Cole2013b,Article,"OBJECTIVES: After a trend of increasing incidence of gonorrhoea in the 1990s, by 2004 the incidence was declining in England, but continuing to increase in Wales. This prompted an investigation of the epidemiology of gonorrhoea in Wales to inform future prevention and control measures. METHODS: As an extension to Gonococcal Resistance to Antimicrobials Surveillance Programme, between May 2005 and September 2006, 540 consecutive gonococcal isolates were collected from three microbiology laboratories in South Wales. Isolates were typed using Neisseria gonorrhoeae Multi Antigen Sequence Typing tested for susceptibility to therapeutic agents and demographic and behavioural data were collected retrospectively from patient notes. RESULTS: 163 sequence types (STs) were identified in 475 N gonorrhoeae isolates from 502 patient episodes. The most frequently observed STs ({\textgreater}20 isolates) were: 2, 752, 471, 249 and 8, all of which were susceptible to the antimicrobial agents tested. A significant association between ST and sexual orientation was identified, the most frequently observed STs occurring in young (median age {\textless}25 years) heterosexuals. STs 147, 4, 1634 and 64 predominated in men who have sex with men. CONCLUSIONS: We confirm the existence of common STs across the UK, as well as identify a number of types that were novel to Wales. Discrete sexual networks were identified, the most localised being in young heterosexuals. Molecular typing provides a method for identifying local clusters of gonorrhoea, and could assist in the implementation and evaluation of targeted interventions.",M J Cole and D Rh Thomas and S A Chisholm and A N Abdullah and H Birley and I Hosein and E Kubiak and D White and I Martin and C A Ison,"1368-4973

4193,YES,Contreras2008,Article,"An unusual increase in infections caused by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus gallinarum (VREG) was identified in May 2004, in a Colombian tertiary care teaching hospital. A case-control study was subsequently designed to identify risk factors associated with the development of infections due to these organisms. All VREG isolates were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing, vancomycin resistance gene detection and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) typing. Additionally, the presence of genes associated with an acquired pathogenicity island of E. faecalis and a hyl-like gene of E. faecium was assessed by hybridisation assays. Eleven cases of VREG were identified between May through June 2004. VREG was isolated from blood (N = 4), surgical secretions (N = 4), paranasal sinus secretion (N = 1), lung abscess (N = 1) and urine (N = 1). Infections with VREG were associated with mucositis, hospitalisation in the haematology ward and surgical unit, length of hospital stay prior to culture and invasive procedures within 30 days prior to the culture. Logistic regression found that female sex and hospitalisation in the surgical unit were independent factors for VREG infection. All isolates were identified as E. gallinarum, harboured the vanC1 gene and exhibited indistinguishable restriction patterns by PFGE. Virulence-associated genes were not detected. This is the first documented hospital-wide outbreak of VREG and highlights the fact that uncommon species of enterococci are capable of nosocomial dissemination. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Hospital Infection Society.",G A Contreras and C A DiazGranados and L Cortes and J Reyes and S Vanegas and D Panesso and S Rincón and L D\'{i}az and G Prada and B E Murray and C A Arias and S Rincon and L Diaz and G Prada and B E Murray and C A Arias,"0195-6701 (Print)

4383,YES,Cremet2013,Article,"Objectives: This study reports details on Escherichia coli isolates recovered from a cystic fibrosis (CF) patient in order to understand how this pathogen adapts to and resists broad-spectrum antipseudomonal therapy in this context. Methods: Five E. coli isolates were obtained from various clinical samples (airways, urine or dialysis catheter) over a 7 month period covering a double-lung transplantation. All isolates were analysed in terms of clonality [enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC)-PCR and multilocus sequence typing], virulence profiles (phylogroup and search for 15 virulence genes), growth patterns (morphotype, biofilm-forming ability and growth rate), hypermutability and antimicrobial susceptibility, with molecular characterization of $\beta$-lactamases and porins. Results: The five isolates shared similar ERIC-PCR profiles and sequence types (ST1193) and exhibited the same virulence profile. The respiratory isolates were strong mutators, exhibited mucoid or small-colony morphotypes, exhibited strong biofilm-forming ability and grew slowly compared with the others. All isolates were highly resistant to ceftazidime. The respiratory isolates showed reduced susceptibility to cefepime and high resistance to aztreonam. The patient had received a 31 day course of ceftazidime/aztreonam until transplantation. All isolates harboured the same wild-type chromosomal AmpC. A CMY-2 enzyme was detected in the non-respiratory isolates. The respiratory isolates harboured L293S and V211A/L293S new CMY-2 variants, which were designated CMY-94 and CMY-95, respectively. OmpF porin loss was observed in the non-respiratory isolates. Conclusions: Our study shows that, similarly to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, E. coli can undergo phenotypic and genomic changes in the CF context. For the first time, we identified an in vivo expanded-spectrum evolution of the CMY-2 $\beta$-lactamase, during bacterial persistence in the CF lung. {\textcopyright} The Author 2013.

Following several discharges and re-admissions, an extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Escherichia coli susceptible to imipenem was isolated. The patient was put on imipenem and metronidazole. Three weeks later, imipenem (IMP) resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae was isolated. METHODS AND RESULTS: The antimicrobial susceptibility profile of the imipenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae strain and related minimum inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics were determined. Hydrolysis of IMP was evaluated and production of metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) was detected by a double disk-synergy test, ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) inhibited the imipenemase activity, whereas clavulanate and tazobactam did not, this suggesting the production of a metallo-beta-lactamase. Isoelectric focusing analysis was performed and indicated the presence of a cefotaximase (blaCTX-M-15). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used and detected the presence of blaIMP-1 and blaCTX-M genes. CONCLUSIONS: During the last decade, many hospital outbreaks caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae spp. have been reported in Lebanon.

Given the lack of information regarding the dynamics of multidrug resistance in northern Brazil, we analyzed the clinical and microbiological features of nosocomial infections caused by P. aeruginosa. Methods: Between January 2010 and March 2012, we conducted a retrospective cohort study of P. aeruginosa isolates from 54 patients who were hospitalized in intensive care units. The clinical and epidemiologic variables were analyzed, including the patients' demographic data and comorbidities, and the lengths of the intensive care unit stays, the classification of the infections as nosocomial, the use of invasive procedures, antimicrobial therapy, and the patients' outcomes. We undertook susceptibility tests, molecular detection of the metallo-$\beta$-lactamase genes, and genotypic analyses of the isolates using the repetitive element-polymerase chain reaction. Results: Multidrug resistance occurred most frequently among isolates from adults who had been hospitalized for an average of 87.1 days. The use of mechanical ventilation and urinary catheters were risk factors for infection. The four isolates that harbored the blaSPM-1-like gene showed {\textgreater}95{\%} genetic similarity. Conclusions: This study's findings show that P. aeruginosa has a high death rate, and that inadequate treatment and invasive procedures are risk factors for infection. This is the first report describing the detection of the blaSPM-1-like gene in northern Brazil.

4841,YES,DeOliveira2014,Article,"Background: Reports of nosocomial infection due to carbapenem resistant Serratia spp. have become significantly more common. This resistance may be due to production of distinct carbapenemases, such as KPC [1,2]. This enzyme, initially described in Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, has also been detected among other organisms, such as Serratia marcescens, emphasizing the global risk of interspecies spread of resistance genes [2,3]. The aim of this study was to identify carbapenemase genes in Serratia spp. Isolated of nosocomial infection. Methods: The samples were collected during May/2012 to May/2013. The strains were recovered from urinary tract, tracheal aspirate and blood culture from patients hospitalized Dourados/MS hospital. The identification of Serratia spp. and the sensitivity test was carried out using a Vitek (BioM{\'{e}}rieux) automated system. All strains with reduced susceptibility to imipenem or meropenem were screened for carbapenemase production by the modified Hodge test as recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute [4]. The presence of KPC coding gene was assessed by PCR as described by Cuzon et al. (2010) [5]. Results and conclusions: From May/2012 to May/2013, fifty strains of Serratia spp. were isolated. The wards that had the highest incidence of Serratia spp. were the intensive care units (ICUs). The strains identified as producing carbapenemases were evaluated by PCR using primers specific for blaKPC gene. Fourteen Serratia spp. strains were positive in PCR. This work describes the first report of KPC gene in Serratia spp. isolates in Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil and confirm the high level of resistance of Serratia spp. against carbapenemics. The clinical importance of detecting carbapenemases producing Serratia spp. is to contribute to hospital infection control, reducing the spread of multidrug-resistant microorganisms and providing results that help in choosing the most appropriate antimicrobial, prolonging patient survival.",P M R {De Oliveira} and W G Maciel and J L {Dos Santos Cunha E Silva} and K E {Da Silva} and M E Correa and N G Vasconcelos and F P C Sacchi and M T R {Da Costa Garcia Croda} and F J Negrão and J H R Croda and S Simionatto,1753-6561,BMC Proceedings,"Brazil,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Serratia,Serratia marcescens,antiinfective agent,biotechnology,blood culture,carbapenem,carbapenemase,enzyme,gene,hospital,hospital infection,human,imipenem,infection control,intensive care unit,laboratory,meropenem,microorganism,patient,risk,society,survival,tracheal aspiration procedure,urinary tract,ward",NA,{Identification of carbapenemase genes in Serratia spp},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L71665302 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=17536561{\&}id=doi:{\&}atitle=Identification+of+carbapenemase+genes+in+Serratia+spp{\&}stitle=BMC+Proc.{\&}title=BMC+Proce,8,2014,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,YES,Brooke,NO,Ayomide,Zach,Zach,yes,,

Results: Due to the spread of fluoroquinolone resistant N. gonorrhoeae fluoroquinolones are no longer recommended for the treatment of gonorrhea. The emergence of N. gonorrhoeae with a mosaic penicillin-binding protein 2 associated with oral cephalosporin resistance has threatened cefixime treatment for gonorrhea. Emergence of N. gonorrhoeae with high level resistance to azithromycin has also been documented. However, injectable antibiotics (sepctinomycin and ceftriaxone) retain their activity against N. gonorrhoeae. To monitor drug resistance in N. gonorrhoeae several national and international programs have become functional. Conclusions: Oral regimens for the treatment of gonorrhea are limited. At present to our knowledge ceftriaxone is the most reliable and available agent for the treatment of gonorrhea. To prevent the further emergence and international spread of drug resistance, and allow for the selection of appropriate treatments, a comprehensive global program is needed including surveillance for drug resistance in N. gonorrhoeae and collection of patient epidemiological data. Clinicians should effectively treat patients with gonorrhea, always being conscious of local trends of drug resistance in N. gonorrhoeae, and should perform culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing in those with persistent gonorrhea after treatment. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.",T Deguchi and K Nakane and M Yasuda and S I Maeda,0022-5347,Journal of Urology,"Medline,Neisseria gonorrhoeae,antibiotic resistance,antibiotic sensitivity,antimicrobial activity,article,azithromycin,bacterial strain,cefdinir,cefixime,cefodizime,ceftibuten,ceftriaxone,cephalosporin,chlamydiasis,ciprofloxacin,dose response,drug blood level,drug formulation,drug megadose,drug monitoring,drug tolerability,enoxacin,gastrointestinal symptom,gonococcal urethritis,gonorrhea,homosexual male,human,levofloxacin,minimum inhibitory concentration,ofloxacin,penicillin G,penicillin binding protein 2a,priority journal,quinoline derived antiinfective agent,single drug dose,spectinomycin,tetracycline,treatment failure",851--858,{Emergence and spread of drug resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L50997064 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.juro.2010.04.078 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=00225347{\&}id=doi:10.1016{\%}2Fj.juro.2010.04.078{\&}atitle=Emergence+and,184,2010,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,YES,Brooke,MAYBE,Mushtaq,Mushtaq,Zach,yes,,

METHODS: A total of 1453 bacterial strains were isolated from patients with hematological disease from January 2005 to December 2011. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by micro-dilution method. RESULTS: (1) The majority of the bacterial strains were respiratory passage examples (57.5{\%}). The portage of blood examples in our division (13.60{\%}) was higher than of whole hospital (6.26{\%}), with lower positive rate of bacterial culture (52.37{\%}) than of whole hospital (60.24{\%}). Chemotherapy-induced agranulocytosis was the main reason for hospital infection. 578 (39.8{\%}) bacterial strains were gram positive, and 875 (60.2{\%}) gram negative bacillus. Staphylococcus epidermidis strains and glucose nonfermenters had a tendency of ascensus. (2) Methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) accounted for 72.8{\%} antibiotic resistance. Detection rates of ESBLs in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were 18.9{\%} and 10.4{\%}, respectively. (3) No obvious changes of antimicrobial resistances of Staphylococcus and Enterococcus were observed during these years. The Enterobacteriaceae strains showed lowest resistance rates to Carbapenems, next to Cefoperazone/sulbactam and Piperacillin/tazobactam. But the resistance rates of Escherichia coli to Cefepime and Ceftazidime were gradually increasing during the past years. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii of glucose nonfermenters showed lowest resistance rates to Cefoperazone/sulbactam, but the resistance rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to Carbapenems increased. CONCLUSIONS: Escherichia coli was the highest in quantity of gram negative bacillus and glucose nonfermenters had a tendency of ascensus. The resistance rates of Escherichia coli to Cefepime and Ceftazidime, Pseudomonas aeruginosa to Carbapenems were gradually increasing in the past years.",Q Deng and Q Li and X M Lin and Y M Li,"0253-2727 (Print)

5362,MAYBE,Dolejska2012a,Article,"In this study, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates in children with malignancies hospitalised at a paediatric oncology department in the Czech Republic were investigated. From June 2009 to January 2010, a total of 50 ESBL-producing faecal isolates of Enterobacteriaceae were obtained from 28 patients. These isolates were characterised with regard to ESBL enzymes, plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and plasmids conferring resistance to cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones. ESBL-producing isolates included Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=36), Escherichia coli (n=7), Klebsiella oxytoca (n=3), Enterobacter cloacae (n=2) and Citrobacter freundii (n=2). Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates belonged to 7 MLST types, including sequence types ST280, ST321, ST323 and ST416 as well as the novel types ST626, ST627 and ST628. The multiresistant epidemic clone E. coli B2-O25b-ST131 was detected in one patient. The gene bla(CTX-M-15) was found on large conjugative IncFII(K) plasmids along with bla(TEM-1), bla(OXA-1), qnrB1, aac(6')-Ib-cr, strA, sul2, aac(3')-II and tet(A) genes in most isolates. Dissemination of IncFII(K) plasmids among various Enterobacteriaceae isolates was considered an important aspect of nosocomial colonisation in the wards by Enterobacteriaceae species producing ESBLs. This is the first study documenting multiple antibiotic resistance elements, including qnr genes, in IncFII(K) plasmids in various bacterial species isolated in a single hospital department. The results highlight the evolution of IncFII(K) plasmids into new variants containing novel antibiotic resistance elements and their important role in spreading ESBL-producing bacteria among hospitalised patients.",M Dolejska and E Brhelova and H Dobiasova and J Krivdova and J Jurankova and A Sevcikova and L Dubska and I Literak and A Cizek and M Vavrina and L Kutnikova and J Sterba,"0924-8579

The aim of this study was to investigate the antibiotic susceptibility and distribution of blaVIM and blaIMP genes in P. aeruginosa isolates from Zanjan Province of Iran. METHODS: A total of 70 P. aeruginosa isolates were identified from patients admitted at intensive care units. The antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by disk diffusion (Kirby-Bauer) method and for production of MBL using double-disk synergy test (DDST). After DNA extraction, the presence of blaVIM and blaIMP genes and class 1 integron were detected by PCR. RESULTS: Most of the isolates were resistant to meropenem, cefotaxime and imipenem (IPM). Also, 44/70 (62.85{\%}) IPM resistant isolates were confirmed by DDST. Of the 44 clinical isolates, 41 (93{\%}) isolates showed MIC{\textgreater}/=4 microg/ml for IPM. Based on the DDST results, 36 (87.8{\%}) were confirmed to be MBL producers. PCR amplification showed that 23/41 (56{\%}) carried blaVIM and 10/41 (24.3{\%}) possessed blaIMP gene. Also, 31/44 (70.5{\%}) isolates contained class 1 integron gene. CONCLUSION: Our results highlight that the genes for Verona integron-encoded metallo-beta-lactamase, IPM beta-lactamases and class 1 integrons were predominantly present among the IPM-resistant P. aeruginosa tested in our province and also the frequency of blaVIM type is higher than blaIMP.

5880,MAYBE,Endimiani2009,Article,"Objectives: To characterize isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae producing KPC carbapenemase (KPC-Kp) associated with an outbreak in a long-term acute care hospital (LTACH) in South Florida. Methods: During 21 March to 20 April 2008, 241 K. pneumoniae isolates detected at Integrated Regional Laboratories (Ft. Lauderdale, FL) for which the ertapenem MICs were ≥4 mg/L were studied. PCR, cloning and sequence analysis were used to detect blaKPC and to characterize the $\beta$-lactamase and outer membrane proteins (Omps). The expression level of KPC enzymes was studied by immunoblotting. Genetic relatedness of isolates was investigated with rep-PCR and PFGE. Clinical records of patients were investigated. Results: Seven KPC-Kp strains were isolated from different patients located at a single LTACH, with a further three isolates being recovered from patients at different hospitals. All KPC-Kp isolates in patients from the LTACH and from one hospital patient were genetically related and shared PFGE patterns that clustered with known sequence type (ST) 258 strains. These strains were highly resistant to carbapenems (MICs ≥ 32 mg/L) due to an increased level of KPC expression and loss of Omps. Rectal colonization was documented in all LTACH patients with KPC-Kp isolates. Treatment failures were common (crude mortality rate of 69{\%}). Active surveillance and enhanced infection control practices terminated the KPC-Kp outbreak. Conclusions: The detection of KPC-Kp in an LTACH represents a serious infection control and therapeutic challenge in a new clinical setting. The speed at which the epidemic of KPC-Kp is spreading in our healthcare system mandates urgent action. {\textcopyright} The Author 2009.

In high-income settings, it has been responsible for an epidemic of poultry-associated, self-limiting enterocolitis, whereas in sub-Saharan Africa it is a major cause of invasive nontyphoidal Salmonella disease, associated with high case fatality. By whole-genome sequence analysis of 675 isolates of S. Enteritidis from 45 countries, we show the existence of a global epidemic clade and two new clades of S. Enteritidis that are geographically restricted to distinct regions of Africa. The African isolates display genomic degradation, a novel prophage repertoire, and an expanded multidrug resistance plasmid. S. Enteritidis is a further example of a Salmonella serotype that displays niche plasticity, with distinct clades that enable it to become a prominent cause of gastroenteritis in association with the industrial production of eggs and of multidrug-resistant, bloodstream-invasive infection in Africa.",N A Feasey and J Hadfield and K H Keddy and T J Dallman and J Jacobs and X Deng and P Wigley and L {Barquist Barquist} and G C Langridge and T Feltwell and S R Harris and A E Mather and M Fookes and M Aslett and C Msefula and S Kariuki and C A Maclennan and R S Onsare and F X Weill and S {Le Hello} and A M Smith and M McClelland and P Desai and C M Parry and J Cheesbrough and N French and J Campos and J A Chabalgoity and L Betancor and K L Hopkins and S Nair and T J Humphrey and O Lunguya and T A Cogan and M D Tapia and S O Sow and S M Tennant and K Bornstein and M M Levine and L Lacharme-Lora and D B Everett and R A Kingsley and J Parkhill and R S Heyderman and G Dougan and M A Gordon and N R Thomson,"1546-1718

6292,MAYBE,Fernandes2010a,Article,"The post-surgical period is often critical for infection acquisition. The combination of patient injury and environmental exposure through breached skin add risk to pre-existing conditions such as drug or depressed immunity. Several factors such as the period of hospital staying after surgery, base disease, age, immune system condition, hygiene policies, careless prophylactic drug administration and physical conditions of the healthcare centre may contribute to the acquisition of a nosocomial infection. A purulent wound can become complicated whenever antimicrobial therapy becomes compromised. In this pilot study, we analysed Enterobacteriaceae strains, the most significant gram-negative rods that may occur in post-surgical skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) presenting reduced beta-lactam susceptibility and those presenting extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL). There is little information in our country regarding the relationship between beta-lactam susceptibility, ESBL and development of resistant strains of microorganisms in SSTI. Our main results indicate Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. are among the most frequent enterobacteria (46{\%} and 30{\%} respectively) with ESBL production in 72{\%} of Enterobacteriaceae isolates from SSTI. Moreover, coinfection occurred extensively, mainly with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (18{\%} and 13{\%}, respectively).

6314,MAYBE,Fernandez2011,Article,"Between February 2006 and October 2009, 38 patients in different wards at the A Coru{\~{n}}a University Hospital (northwest Spain) were either infected with or colonized by an epidemic, multidrug-resistant (MDR), and extended-spectrum-$\beta$-lactamase (ESBL)-producing strain of Enterobacter cloacae (EbSF), which was susceptible only to carbapenems. Semiautomated repetitive extragenic palindromic sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis revealed that all of the E. cloacae isolates belonged to the same clone. Cloning and sequencing enabled the detection of the SFO-1 ESBL in the epidemic strain and the description of its genetic environment. The presence of the ampR gene was detected upstream of blaSFO-1, and two complete sequences of IS26 surrounding ampR and ampA were detected. These IS26 sequences are bordered by complete left and right inverted repeats (IRL and IRR, respectively), which suggested that they were functional. The whole segment flanked by two IS26 copies may be considered a putative large composite transposon. A gene coding for aminoglycoside acetyltransferase (gentamicin resistance gene [aac3]) was found downstream of the 3′ IS26. Despite the implementation of strict infection control measures, strain EbSF spread through different areas of the hospital. A case-control study was performed to assess risk factors for EbSF acquisition. A multivariate analysis revealed that the prior administration of $\beta$-lactam antibiotics, chronic renal failure, tracheostomy, and prior hospitalization were statistically associated with SFO-1-producing E. cloacae acquisition. This study describes for the first time an outbreak in which an SFO-1-producing E. cloacae strain was involved. Note that so far, this $\beta$-lactamase has previously been isolated in only a single case of E. cloacae infection in Japan. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2011, American Society for Microbiology.

7267,YES,Giani2011,Article,"Objectives: Metallo $\beta$-lactamases (MBLs) are resistance determinants of great clinical relevance, given their ability to hydrolyze almost all $\beta$-lactams, including carbapenems. Among MBLs, NDM-1 is one of the most worrisome due to its propensity to rapid dissemination among Enterobacteriaceae. Here we report on the characterization of the first NDM-1 positive isolates from an Italian hospital. Methods: A total of 8 NDM-1-positive E. coli isolates obtained during 2009-2010 from stool and wound-exudate samples of two Italian patients were studied. Susceptibility testing were performed using Vitek2 system (Biomerieux). MICs of carbapenems, amikacin, piperacillin-tazobactam, colistin and tigecycline were confirmed by Etest (Biomerieux). Detection of resistance genes was performed using a custom microarray and all positive signals were confirmed by PCR. Clonality was investigated by PFGE and MLST. Localization of blaNDM-1 was investigated by Southern blot hybridizations. Gene transfer experiments were performed both by electroporation and conjugation. The genetic environment of blaNDM-1 was investigated by the inverse-PCR (iPCR) technique. Results: Isolates showed a MDR phenotype being not susceptible to all tested antibiotics, except colistin and, in 7 cases tigecycline. Carbapenem MICs were 4-8 mg/L (imipenem), 8-{\textgreater}32 mg/L (meropenem), 2-16 mg/L (doripenem), and {\textgreater}32 mg/L (ertapenem). Microarray, in conjunction with PCR and sequencing, revealed the presence in all isolates of blaNDM-1, blaTEM-1, blaOXA-1, blaOXA-9, blaCTXM- 15, tetA(B), tetA(C), armA, aac(6)-Ib-cr, aac(3)-II, catB3, and arr3 resistance determinants. PFGE and MLST demonstrated that isolates were clonally related and belonged to ST405. blaNDM-1 was not transferred either by electroporation or by conjugation using different E. coli recipients. iPCR experiments revealed an original genetic structure, characterized by an intact IS26 insertion sequence upstream blaNDM-1. Results from Southern-Blot experiments revealed the likely presence of 2 copies of blaNDM-1 in the investigated isolates, with one plasmid-encoded. Conclusions: Characterization of the genetic environment of the first NDM-1 positive Italian isolates revealed an original arrangement, underscoring the promiscuity of genetic elements carrying blaNDM-1. The presence of a plethora of different clinically relevant resistance determinants in such isolates is a worrisome finding given the scarce number of effective therapeutic options available.",T Giani and M M D'Andrea and F Arena and V Conte and C Venturelli and P Bresciani and F Rumpianesi and F Narni and G M Rossolini,1198-743X,Clinical Microbiology and Infection,"Enterobacteriaceae,Escherichia coli,Southern blotting,amikacin,antibiotic agent,carbapenem,carbapenem derivative,clonal variation,colistin,conjugation,doripenem,electroporation,environment,epsilometer test,ertapenem,gene,gene insertion sequence,gene transfer,genetic variability,hospital,human,hybridization,imipenem,inverse polymerase chain reaction,lactam,meropenem,patient,penicillinase,phenotype,piperacillin,plasmid,recipient,tazobactam,tigecycline,trientine,wound fluid",S138,{Characterisation of the first NDM-1 metallo $\beta$-lactamase producing escherichia coli isolates from an Italian hospital},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L70599318 http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-0691.2011.03558.x http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=1198743X{\&}id=doi:10.1111{\%}2Fj.1469-0691.2011.03558.x{\&}atitle=C,17,2011,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,YES,Brooke,NO,Mushtaq,Allison,Zach,no,could not find full-text,

7582,MAYBE,Goto2013,Article,"Introduction: Bacteroides fragilis , among the mostcommonanaerobic pathogens recovered from various infection sites, is resistant to a broader range of antimicrobials, compared with most other anaerobes. Approximately 2{\%} of B. fragilis clinical isolates are resistant to carbapenems, 20{\%} of these resistant strains show high level of resistance (MIC; 25-200 mg/ml) by producing a carbapenemase (CfiA), a metallo-$\beta$-lactamase. Although the cfiA gene is generally located on the B. fragilis chromosome,we previously identified for the first time a clinical isolate, the GAI92082 strain, in which CfiA is encoded by a mobilizable plasmid - pBFUK1. Objectives: In this study, we analyzed the complete nucleotide sequence of pBFUK1 and conducted the first distribution analysis of pBFUK1-like plasmids among carbapenem-resistant B. fragilis isolates. Methods:We sequenced pBFUK1 by inverse PCR and primer walking methods, providing an approximately 3.9-fold coverage across the length of pBFUK1. To investigate the distribution of pBFUK1-like plasmids, we extracted plasmids from 12 carbapenem-resistant B. fragilis strains isolated from patients in Japan from 1987 to 2006. Extracted plasmids were separated by an electrophoresis and were transferred to a nylon membrane, followed by the Southern blotting analysis to detect 7 genes on the pBFUK1 sequence. Results: The sequenced pBFUK1 plasmid consists of 12,817 nucleotides and encodes 16 putative open reading frames (ORFs). All ORFs showed 95-100{\%} amino-acid identity to known proteins identified in the genus Bacteroides . The pBFUK1 consists of a 4.3- kb backbone region, containing proteins related to plasmid replication, maintenance and mobilization, and a novel 8.5-kb composite transposon (designated Tn6186 ). The 3 mobilization proteins in pBFUK1 showed almost 100{\%} amino-acid identity to those in pLV22a plasmid from B. fragilis strain LV22. The Tn6186 transposon is flanked by 2 known insertion sequence elements (IS613 and IS615) and includes the cfiA gene and its putative promoter, and a small putative multidrug resistance protein gene. Nine of the 12 carbapenemresistant isolates possessed 1-3 plasmids. Southern blotting showed that the cfiA and transposase genes were only present on pBFUK1. Conclusion:We discovered a novel composite transposon, including the cfiA gene and its promoter, in the pBFUK1 sequence. Moreover, we found that CfiA-encoding pBFUK1-like plasmids were not widely distributed among carbapenem-resistant clinical isolates collected in Japan from 1987 to 2006. pBFUK1 may be mobilizable into other strains in the genus Bacteroides or other genus when co-residentwith a helper factor that carries genes encoding the systemformating pair formation.",T Goto and K Tanaka and C M Tran and K Watanabe,0924-8579,International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents,"Asia,Bacteroides,Bacteroides fragilis,Japan,Southern blotting,amino acid,anaerobe,antiinfective agent,carbapenem,carbapenem derivative,carbapenemase,chemotherapy,chromosome,electrophoresis,gene,gene insertion sequence,genus,helper factor,human,identity,infection,inverse polymerase chain reaction,membrane,microbiology,mobilization,multidrug resistance protein,nucleotide,nucleotide sequence,nylon,open reading frame,pathogenesis,patient,penicillinase,plasmid,promoter region,protein,transposase,transposon,walking",S53,"{Complete sequence of pBFUK1, a carbapenemase-harboring plasmid from Bacteroides fragilis, and distribution of pBFUK1-like plasmids}",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L71102727 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0924-8579(13)70282-6 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=09248579{\&}id=doi:10.1016{\%}2FS0924-8579{\%}2813{\%}2970282-6{\&}atitle=Com,42,2013,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,MAYBE,Cale,NO,Mushtaq,Allison,Zach,yes,,

7784,YES,Gruber2013,Article,"Introduction: Resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in clinically relevant Gram-negative species is mediated by different beta-lactamases, with metallo-beta-lactamases being among the most widespread carbapenemases worldwide. We report on a Yemeni patient, who presented at the University clinic in Frankfurt, Germany, and who was tested positive for a carbapenem-resistant E. coli. Carbapenem resistance was mediated by a new variant of the New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM). Material/Methods: Isolates were characterized by MIC testing and screened for carbapenemase, ESBL and AmpC resistance genes by PCR and subsequent sequencing. Horizontal gene transfer of blaNDM was analyzed in transconjugation experiments. Plasmid analysis was done by restriction fragment length polymorphism using BamHI, EcoRI and XHoI and PCR based replicon typing methods. The multidrug-resistant E. coli isolate was further characterized by MLST sequence typing. Molecular modelling was performed using the software tool Molecular Operating Environment. Results: E. coli isolates with an identical resistance pattern were collected from a Yemeni patient from different body sites including wounds, throat and rectum. MIC testing of the E. coli revealed resistance to all beta-lactam antibiotics including carbapenems. The beta-lactamase genes blaCMY-2, blaCTX-M-15 and blaTEM-1 were detected via PCR and sequence analysis. An identified blaNDM was found to differ from the known blaNDM-1 by two nucleotide mutations at position 388 (G{\`{a}}A) and 460 (A{\`{a}}C) corresponding to amino acid substitutions D130N and M154L, respectively. The new variant of NDM was identified as NDM-7. blaNDM-7 was shown to be located on an IncX3 type plasmid with a size of 60 kb. E. coli transformants harbouring NDM-7 showed higher MICs for beta-lactams including carbapenems compared to transformants harbouring NDM-1. MLST typing of the NDM-7 positive strain resulted in a new, yet undescribed sequence type (ST)-599 which showed closest relatedness to ST462 and ST463. Molecular modelling indicated that Leu154 in NDM-7 influences the flexibility of the binding pocket, thereby leading to lower substrate specificity and finally elevated carbapenem MICs. Discussion: This study identified a novel NDM-type beta-lactamase, NDM-7, possessing a high ability to hydrolyse carbapenems and cephalosporins. The occurrence of new NDM variants in Enterobacteriaceae is of great concern, especially in low-prevalence countries such as Germany. It further illustrates the rapid evolution of the NDM gene and the role of intercontinental travel and healthcare tourism in the global dissemination of multiresistant organisms. Since NDM-expressing Gram-negatives will most likely further disseminate and treatment options are very limited, rigorous screening and the prophylactic isolation of at-risk patients seem indispensable.",M Gruber and A Hamprecht and S Christ and D Büttner and E Proschak and V A J Kempf and T A Wichelhaus and S Göttig,1438-4221,International Journal of Medical Microbiology,"Enterobacteriaceae,Escherichia coli,Germany,amino acid substitution,beta lactam,beta lactam antibiotic,beta lactamase,carbapenem,carbapenem derivative,carbapenemase,cephalosporin derivative,environment,enzyme specificity,extended spectrum beta lactamase,gene,health care,horizontal gene transfer,hospital,human,hydrolysis,hygiene,metallo beta lactamase,microbiology,minimum inhibitory concentration,model,mutation,nucleotide,patient,plasmid,prevalence,rectum,replicon,restriction fragment length polymorphism,risk,screening,sequence analysis,society,software,species,throat,tourism,travel,university,wound",92,{First description of the New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase NDM-7 in Germany},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L71206651 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmm.2013.08.004 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=14384221{\&}id=doi:10.1016{\%}2Fj.ijmm.2013.08.004{\&}atitle=First+descrip,303,2013,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,YES,Cale,YES,Erica,Erica,Zach,no,could not find full-text,

8298,YES,Harris2016b,Article,"INTRODUCTION: Over two million hospital-acquired (nosocomial) infections occur each year in the United States, and 50-60{\%} are caused by antimicrobial-resistant strains of bacteria. CASE PRESENTATION: A 67-year-old man presented to the ER with symptoms of confusion, lethargy and worsening somnolence. Medical history included carcinoma of the throat, atrial fibrillation, type-2 diabetes mellitus, COPD, and ischemic stroke. Heart rate, creatinine, WBC and lactate were elevated. Ultrasound revealed B lines and hepatization over the left lower lung. Abdominal CT scan confirmed a consolidative lung process (Figure 1) and revealed an impacted ureteral stone which was surgically treated. Blood and urine cultures were positive for Citrobacter koseri resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, susceptible to meropenem and variably susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam and ciprofloxacin. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a vegetative mitral valve mass supporting the diagnosis of bacterial (Citrobacter koseri) endocarditis (Figure 2). The patient responded favorably to a six-week course of IV antibiotics with meropenem. DISCUSSION: Important organisms that cause nosocomial infections include vancomycin-resistant Enterococci, methicillinresistant Staphylococci, and Gram-negative isolates with variable resistance patterns. Key Gram-negative resistance patterns arise from extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in enteric bacilli, high-level third-generation cephalosporin beta-lactamase resistance in Enterobacteriaceae and Citrobacter genus, and multidrug resistance in pseudomonads and Acinetobacter genus. Certain Citrobacter isolates, such as C. koseri, produce a small amount of beta-lactamase constitutively, while other Citrobacter species (such as C. amaloniticus) produce beta-lactamase which can mutate to high-level beta-lactamase resistance. Citrobacter causes endocarditis rarely, and only one report of C. koseri mitral valve endocarditis exists in the English language. Fourth-generation cephalosporins, piperacillin/tazobactam, and carbapenems are efficacious therapies for nosocomial infections caused by Gramnegative organisms with high beta-lactam resistance. CONCLUSIONS: The expanding epidemic of antibiotic resistant nosocomial infections has become a public health crisis.

All four patients were transferred from, or had recently been in, hospitals in countries where KPC-producing organisms are prevalent (China, India, Greece and Italy). The bla KPC-2 gene was identified in the isolates from three patients and bla KPC-3 was identified in the isolate from the remaining patient. The isolates belonged to different multilocus sequence type clonal complexes, usually those prevalent in the country in which the patient had been previously hospitalised.

8632,MAYBE,Hill2012a,Article,"Objectives: We sought evidence for resistance to colistin amongst all isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae submitted to the national reference service from January to November 2011 and similarly reviewed all isolates collected in 2003 onwards. Methods: Clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae from patients throughout England were referred to the HPA reference service for evaluation. Patient details were collated and repeat specimens excluded. MICs of 27 antibiotics, including beta-lactams, aminoglycosides and colistin, were determined for each isolate by agar dilution (BSAC method). Current BSAC/EUCAST breakpoints for all antibiotics tested (e.g. MIC {\textgreater} 2 for colistin) were applied to isolates collected from 2003 to 2011 inclusive. Resistance mechanisms present in 2011 isolates were compared to those of the first colistin-resistant isolates within the 8 previous years (period 2003-2011). Results: There were 28 colistin-resistant K. pneumoniae from 29 patients in 19 hospitals during the first 10 months of 2011 compared to three isolates from three patients in two hospitals in 2004 and none in 2003. MICs of colistin were from 4 to {\textgreater}32 in 2011 but all were {\textgreater}32 in 2004. In 2011, there were 18 male (aged 4 weeks to 82 years) and 10 female (aged 18-83 years) patients. Nine isolates were from urine, five from wounds, four each from blood or faeces, two from line tips and one each from umbilicus, sputum or nose. Five patients were from one hospital and two different isolates from one patient in another hospital. Of the 28 isolates, 14 had an ESBL whilst 18 had a carbapenemase of which three were metallo-beta-lactamases (MBL) plus an ESBL. Nine were pan-aminoglycoside resistant and only seven had sensitivity to one aminoglycoside; due to beta-lactamase action + reduced permeability, only two were sensitive to ertapenem (MICs ≤ 0.5). Five were sensitive to tigecycline only and one was non-susceptible. One of the 2004 isolates had a ceftazidimase whilst the other two a CTX-M. In 2005 there were nine colistin-resistant isolates (MIC = 32) from six hospitals - two identical strains from one hospital and three from another; all had CTX-Ms and one an MBL. All isolates were pan-resistant to cephalosporins (cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefpirome; MICs 32 to {\textgreater}256). Conclusion: The first isolates of K. pneumonia resistant to colistin occurred in 2004, with an increase of almost ten times that in 2011.

8709,MAYBE,Hoa2011,Article,"BACKGROUND: Streptococcus suis is an emerging zoonotic pathogen and is the leading cause of bacterial meningitis in adults in Vietnam. Systematic data on the antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of S. suis strains isolated from human cases are lacking. We studied antimicrobial resistance and associated resistance determinants in S. suis isolated from patients with meningitis in southern Vietnam. METHODS: S. suis strains isolated between 1997 and 2008 were investigated for their susceptibility to six antimicrobial agents. Strains were screened for the presence and expression of tetracycline and erythromycin resistance determinants and the association of tet(M) genes with Tn916- like transposons. The localization of tetracycline resistance gene tet(L) was determined by pulse field gel electrophoresis and Southern blotting. RESULTS: We observed a significant increase in resistance to tetracycline and chloramphenicol, which was concurrent with an increase in multi-drug resistance. In tetracycline resistance strains, we identified tet(M), tet(O), tet(W) and tet(L) and confirmed their expression. All tet(M) genes were associated with a Tn916-like transposon. The co-expression of tet(L) and other tetracycline resistance gene(s) encoding for ribosomal protection protein(s) was only detected in strains with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of tetracycline of {\textgreater}/= 64 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that multi-drug resistance in S. suis causing disease in humans in southern Vietnam has increased over the 11-year period studied. We report the presence and expression of tet(L) in S. suis strains and our data suggest that co-expression of multiple genes encoding distinct mechanism is required for an MIC {\textgreater}/= 64 mg/L to tetracycline.",N T Hoa and T T Chieu and H D Nghia and N T Mai and P H Anh and M Wolbers and S Baker and J I Campbell and N V Chau and T T Hien and J Farrar and C Schultsz,1471-2334,BMC Infect Dis,"*Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial,Adult,Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology,Bacterial Proteins/genetics,Female,Humans,Male,Meningitis, Bacterial/*microbiology,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Streptococcal Infections/*microbiology,Streptococcus suis/classification/*drug effects/ge,Vietnam",6,"{The antimicrobial resistance patterns and associated determinants in Streptococcus suis isolated from humans in southern Vietnam, 1997-2008}",NA,11,2011,NA,"1471-2334

She was admitted to the hospital due to acute delirium on March 21, 2014. Brain CT showed mild cerebral atrophy. Laboratory data showed hemogram, 10.5 g/ dL; WBC, 14,900/mL; CRP, 63.9 mg/L; and creatinine, 2.8 mg/dL. CXR showed mild bronchiectasis with probably superimposed infection. Empirical antibiotic was ceftazidime. The sputum culture yielded mixed normal flora. The blood and urine cultures showed no growth. However, CRP rose to 114.0 mg/L on March 31. Fosfomycin was added. The blood and sputum cultures showed no significant bacteria, but the urine culture yielded yeast-like organism. A CRP rose to 135.3 mg/L on April 7. Thus doripenem and fluconazole were used. Then condition was stable and she was discharged to a nursing home on April 14. On June 19, 2014, she returned with a fever of 38°C. Urine routine showed WBC, 50-99/HPF; leukocyte esterase 3+ and bacilli 3+. Co-amoxiclav was used for 7 days.

However, the epidemiology of A. baumannii causing burn-related bloodstream infections has rarely been reported. We retrospectively collected 81 A. baumannii isolates from the bloodstream of burn patients over a three-year period. Antibiotic susceptibility tests, the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant genes and sequence typing (ST) were conducted to characterize these strains. Most of the isolates showed an extensive drug-resistant phenotype. The resistance frequencies to imipenem and meropenem were 94{\%} and 91{\%}, respectively. The blaOXA-23-like gene, AmpC, IS-AmpC, PER and SIM are the five most prevalent resistant genes, and their prevalence rates are 93{\%} (75/81), 86{\%} (70/81), 73{\%} (59/81), 73{\%} (59/81) and 52{\%} (42/81), respectively. The 81 isolates were grouped into 10 known and 18 unknown ST types, with ST368 (38{\%}) being the most prevalent. Except for ST457 and four new types (STn2, STn6, STn11 and STn14), the remaining 23 ST types belonged to one clonal complex 92, which is most common among clinical isolate in China. The above results indicated that ST368 isolates possessing both the blaOXA-23-like gene and ampC gene were the main culprits of the increasing nosocomial A. baumannii infection in this study.

9305,MAYBE,Ingti2016,Article,"Background: Escherichia coli are the major causes of urinary tract infection (UTI) and an emerging problem worldwide. These organisms harbouring AmpC beta-lactamase is a major cause of therapeutic failure leaving cephalosporins inactive along with coexisting mechanism of resistance. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of Escherichia coli producing AmpC betalactamase in UTI and analyse their antibiotic susceptibility pattern from a tertiary care hospital in North Eastern part of India. Methods {\&} Materials: A total of 126 Escherichia coli were biochemically identified from a 293 consecutive non repetitive clini-cal isolates which were obtained from patient with UTI over a period of 12 months (February2013 to January 2014). Isolates were initially screened with cefoxitin (30$\mu$g) and confirmed for production of AmpC beta-lactamases by M3DET. Phenotypically positive isolates were further confirmed by multiplex PCR targeting blaCIT, blaACC, blaEBC, blaDHA, blaFOX, blaMOX families Antimicrobial susceptibility and MIC's were also determined as per CLSI guideline. Results: Out of 126 Escherichia coli isolates 97(76.9{\%}) were found to be cefoxitin resistant and among them 46 (47.4{\%}) isolates were confirmed to be AmpC producers. Most of the AmpC positive isolates were found to be significantly multi-drug resistant and their minimum inhibition concentrations were above the break point. Out of 46 isolates 39 (84.7{\%}) showed genotypically positive for blaAmpCgenes (24CIT, 12DHA and 3EBC). Conclusion: In the present study AmpC $\beta$-lactamase production is accompanied by multi drug resistance therefore, therapeutic options become limited resulting a need for new measures for the management of Escherichia coli causing urinary tract infections.",B Ingti and D Dhar and A Chakravarty and A Bhattacharjee,1201-9712,International Journal of Infectious Diseases,"Escherichia coli,India,antibiotic sensitivity,beta lactamase,beta lactamase AmpC,cefoxitin,cephalosporin derivative,drug resistance,human,infection,inhibitory concentration,minimum inhibitory concentration,multiplex polymerase chain reaction,patient,penicillinase,prevalence,tertiary care center,tertiary health care,urinary tract infection",94,{AmpC $\beta$-lactamase producing Escherichia coli associated with urinary tract infection from a tertiary health care centre in North East India},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L72245202 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2016.02.249 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=12019712{\&}id=doi:10.1016{\%}2Fj.ijid.2016.02.249{\&}atitle=AmpC+$\beta$-lactam,45,2016,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,MAYBE,Cale,NO,Mushtaq,Allison,Zach,yes,,
9377,MAYBE,Islam2011a,Article,"Objective: The main objective was to detect and characterize NDM-1 positive Enterobacteriaceae in Bangladesh. Methods: A total of 1789 E. coli and 90 Shigella from diarrhoeal patients and healthy controls in 2009-2010 and 1816 clinical samples isolated in October 2010 were analysed for imipenem resistance. Gramnegative strains were isolated from 403/1816 samples. 100 ESBLproducing E. coli isolated in 2008-2009 were also analysed. Imipenem susceptibility was determined and the presence of NDM-1 gene was assessed by PCR. NDM-1 positive isolates were characterized. Plasmid profiles were analyzed and presence of transmissible R-plasmid was determined by conjugation and hybridization. All NDM-1 positive patients were contacted and interviewed using a short standard questionnaire. Results: All E. coli and Shigella isolates from diarrhoeal patients and healthy controls were susceptible to imipenem. Among 403 Gramnegative clinical isolates, 55/403 (13.6{\%}) were resistant to imipenem and 14/403 (3.5{\%}) were NDM-1 positive. These 14 isolates were cultured from 12 patients with the following clinical diagnoses: UTI (n = 5), RTI (n = 4), wound infections (n = 1), unknown (n = 2). Of these 12 patients, 10 could be contacted. All 10 patients had received antibiotics during the last 3 months, 5 were treated with carbapenems. All patients reported hospitalization in last 3 months. The mean age of patients was 55 years and the male to female ratio was 1:2 (N = 12). Of the 10 patients, outcome of treatment was not clear for three, condition improved for three and two patients died. Among 100 ESBL producing E. coli and Klebsiella strains 4 were resistant to imipenem, of which 3 were NDM-1 positive. Out of 17 NDM-1 positive strains 10 were Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 E. coli, 3 Acinetobacter baumannii, 1 Providencia rettgeri, and 1 Citrobacter freundii. All NDM-1 positive isolates were resistant to multiple antibiotics, including aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins, and carbapenems. The only antimicrobials that were effective in vitro were tigecycline and colistin. ESBL genes were detected, including blaTEM, blaSHV, blaOXA and blaCTX-M. Many strains contained 2-8 plasmids. Plasmid profiles were diverse. Conjugation and Southern blot hybridization revealed that the NDM-1 gene was located in a self-transmissible plasmid of ∼30 MDa in size.

9540,MAYBE,Jamal2009,Article,"Clostridium difficile is a common cause of nosocomial diarrhea. its role in community-acquired diarrhea is also becoming an important public health concern. Hardly any studies have correlated strain ribotypes, toxinotypes and multidrug resistant (MDR) profiles. To investigate these characteristics, 65 C. difficile isolates obtained from stool samples of patients whose cultures were negative on admission but became positive after 48 h of admission to the ICUs of our hospitals were studied to determine the prevalent ribotypes, toxinotypes and their relationship with the MDR profiles using ELISA/cytotoxicity assays, PCR and Etest methods. The toxin-producing strains were toxinotyped by the PCR-RFLP technique. Of the 65 isolates, 42 (64.6{\%}) were toxigenic (T). The isolates were of diverse ribotypes but types 097, 078, 056 and 039 (NT) were predominant. thirty (71.4{\%}) of 42 T and 13 (56.5{\%}) of 23 NT strains were multiresistant to 3 or more antibiotics. Only 3 toxinotypes (0, {""}V-like{""} and XII) were encountered. Of the 42 t strains, 30 (71.4{\%}) were of toxinotype 0, and 12 belonged to variant toxinotypes: 4 (9.4{\%}) to toxinotype XII and 8 (19{\%}) to {""}V-like{""} toxinotype in which amplified B1 PCR fragments was amplified as expected for toxinotype V but the A3 PCR fragment could not be amplified. The 43 mDR strains were assigned to 3 arbitrary resistance groups; groups 1, 11 and III. the most prevalent isolates (37; 86.1{\%}) were in group II. Of the predominant T ribotypes (097, 078 and 056), c. 62{\%} clustered in group II.

Resistance pattern of bacterial isolates determine empiric antibiotic therapy and influence outcome. AIMS: This study was planned to determine profile of bacterial isolates and their antibiotic resistance pattern among pediatric cancer patients. DESIGN: It was a retrospective, single institutional study. Materials and Methods: The study was carried out in the department of pediatric hematology-oncology of a tertiary care cancer centre in north India over a period of 24 months (2012-2014). Microbiological data pertaining to pediatric cancer patients, less than 18yrs of age was analysed. Results: Hence, 238 bacterial isolates were cultured from among 1757 blood, urine and other specimens. Gram negative bacteria were the most common (74{\%}) pathogens identified and E. coli and Klebsiella comprised 80{\%} of them. A high incidence of extended spectrum beta lactamase producing organisms (84{\%}), beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitor (78{\%}) and carbapenem resistance was observed (29{\%}). Blood stream infection with multi-drug resistant Klebsiella was associated with high mortality. The gram positive bacteria isolated were predominantly staphylococcus aureus and were antibiotic sensitive. Reduction in the number of culture positive isolates in the second year of our study was probably due to rigorous implementation of infection control measures. Conclusion: These results on microbiologic profile and antibiotic sensitivity pattern of the isolates will be extremely helpful in revision of antibiotic guidelines for our patients and in developing strategies for coping with high prevalence of multi-drug resistance. Antibiotic stewardship and strict implementation of infection control practices will be important components of this effort.",G Kapoor and N Sachdeva and S Jain,"1998-4774

We investigated this outbreak to determine risk factors and transmission settings. Methods: The CDAD cases were compared according to where the disease was likely acquired based on health care exposure and characterization of isolates from case patients, asymptomatic carriers, and the environment. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing, strain typing using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and toxinotyping were performed, and toxins A and B, binary toxin, and deletions in the tcdC gene were detected using polymerase chain reaction. Risk factors were examined in a case-control study, and overall antimicrobial use was compared at the hospital before and during the outbreak. Results: Significant increases were observed in hospital-acquired (0.19 vs 0.86; P{\textless}.001) and long-term care facility-acquired (0.04 vs 0.31; P=.004) CDAD cases per 100 admissions as a result of transmission of a toxinotype III strain at the hospital and a toxinotype 0 strain at the long-term care facility. The toxinotype III strain was positive for binary toxin, an 18-base pair deletion in tcdC, and increased resistance to fluoroquinolones. Independent risk factors for CDAD included use of fluoroquinolones (odds ratio [OR], 3.22; P=.04), cephalosporins (OR, 5.19; P=.006), and proton pump inhibitors (OR, 5.02; P=.02). A significant increase in fluoroquinolone use at the hospital took place during the outbreak (185.5 defined daily doses per 1000 patient-days vs 200.9 defined daily doses per 1000 patient-days; P{\textless}.001). Conclusions: The hospital outbreak of CDAD was caused by transmission of a more virulent, fluoroquinolone-resistant strain of C difficile. More selective fluoroquinolone and proton pump inhibitor use may be important in controlling and preventing such outbreaks. {\textcopyright}2006 American Medical Association.

METHOD: We first screened 35 T. b. rhodesiense strains in the mouse model, for sensitivity to melarsoprol (1.8, 3.6 and 7.2 mg/kg), diminazene aceturate (3.5, 7 and 14 mg/kg), suramin (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg) and isometamidium (0.1, 1.0 and 2 mg/kg). A 13 isolates suspected to be resistant were selected for further testing in vitro and in vivo. From the in vitro testing, IC(50) values were determined by short-term viability assay, and MIC values were calculated by long-term viability assay. For in vivo testing, doses higher than those in the initial screening test were used. RESULTS: Two T. b rhodesiense stocks expressed resistance in vivo to melarsoprol at 5 mg/kg and at 10 mg/kg. These strains had high IC(50) and MIC values consistent with those of the melarsoprol-resistant reference strain. Another isolate relapsed after treatment with 5 mg/kg of melarsoprol although it did not appear resistant in vitro. One isolate was resistant to diminazene at 14 mg/kg and another was resistant at both 14 and 28 mg/kg of diminazene. These two isolates had high IC(50) values consistent with the diminazene-resistant reference strain. Two isolates relapsed at a dose of 5 mg/kg of suramin, although no isolate appeared resistant in the in vitro tests. Two isolates were resistant to isometamidium at 1.0 mg/kg and had higher IC(50) values. Two isolates were cross-resistant to melarsoprol and diminazene and one isolate was cross-resistant to suramin and isometamidium. CONCLUSION: The reduced susceptibility of T. b. rhodesiense isolates to these drugs strongly indicates that drug resistance may be emerging in north-western Tanzania.",S N Kibona and L Matemba and J S Kaboya and G W Lubega,"1360-2276 (Print)

10825,MAYBE,Ko2009,Article,"OBJECTIVES: The Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends (SMART) was intended to reveal the evolving profiles of antimicrobial resistance among Gram-negative pathogens causing intra-abdominal infections (IAIs). METHODS: Aerobic and facultatively anaerobic Gram-negative isolates were prospectively collected from patients with IAIs in the Asia/Pacific region between 2002 and 2006. Only clinically significant isolates were included for susceptibility tests by the microdilution method. Phenotypic identification of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production was performed on Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and Enterobacter spp., with the measurements of MICs of cefepime alone and in the presence of clavulanic acid. RESULTS: Of 7239 Gram-negative isolates, Enterobacteriaceae accounted for the majority (81.5{\%}), and the three major species were E. coli (42.5{\%}), Klebsiella pneumoniae (15.7{\%}) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9.6{\%}). The susceptibility rates of Enterobacteriaceae isolates to cephalosporins decreased, in parallel with the fact that the prevalence of ESBLs increased from 13{\%} in 2002 to 28{\%} in 2006. Among E. coli isolates, the proportion of isolates producing an ESBL varied greatly between countries, ranging from 38.6{\%} in China to 1.2{\%} in New Zealand, and ciprofloxacin susceptibility rate from 41.6{\%} in China to 95.8{\%} in New Zealand. Carbapenems and amikacin were in vitro active against more than 95{\%} of Enterobacteriaceae isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Antimicrobial resistance was frequently present among Gram-negative isolates from IAIs in the Asia/Pacific region. During the study period, there were increasing resistant rates of E. coli isolates to cephalosporins, but wide variations existed among countries. Regular updates of treatment guidelines for this region are necessary for empiric antimicrobial therapy.",W C Ko and P R Hsueh,0163-4453,J Infect,"*Drug Resistance, Bacterial,Abdominal Abscess/*microbiology,Animals,Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology,Asia,Australasia,Gram-Negative Bacteria/*drug effects/enzymology/is,Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections/*microbiology,Humans,Microbial Sensitivity Tests/methods,Prospective Studies,Quinolones/*pharmacology,beta-Lactamases/*biosynthesis/classification,beta-Lactams/*pharmacology",95--103,{Increasing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production and quinolone resistance among Gram-negative bacilli causing intra-abdominal infections in the Asia/Pacific region: data from the Smart Study 2002-2006},NA,59,2009,2,"1532-2742

Methods: A retrospective chart review of patients one to 18 years of age who were admitted to Kingston General Hospital with a discharge diagnosis of urinary tract infection between 2002 and early 2006 was undertaken. Results: One hundred forty-two patient charts were reviewed, of which 56.3{\%} of patients were female. The mean age of the patients was 12.3 months. The most common bacteria identified on urine culture over a five-year period were Escherichia coli (71.6{\%}), Enterococcus species (5.7{\%}) and Klebsiella species (5.0{\%}). Bacteria were frequently resistant to ampicillin (54.4{\%}) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) (40.4{\%}). During the three months before admission, bacteria resistant to ampicillin were cultured from the urine of 75.6{\%} of patients who were receiving some antibiotic, compared with 44{\%} of children with no documented use of antibiotics (P{\textless}0.0001). Resistance to TMP-SMX in those with pre-existing genitourinary disease was 72.2{\%} versus 31.8{\%} in those without (P{\textless}0.0001). Patients who had previous admissions for urinary tract infections also showed greater resistance to TMP-SMX (70.6{\%} versus 32.7{\%}; P{\textless}0.005), cefazolin (64.7{\%} versus 20.0{\%}; P{\textless}0.0001) and nitrofurantoin (58.8{\%} versus 18.2{\%}; P{\textless}0.0001). Conclusions: There was a high resistance to ampicillin. Risk factors for resistant bacteria included the use of antibiotics three months before admission, previous genitourinary disease and previous admissions for urinary tract infections. In the presence of these risk factors, a third-generation cephalosporin as first-line antimicrobial therapy is recommended. However, the combination of ampicillin plus gentamicin can be considered for empirical therapy in low-risk patients. {\textcopyright} 2008 Pulsus Group Inc.

The transferability of the phenotypes was tested by conjugation to Escherichia coli J53. The isoelectric point was determinate by isoelectrofocalisation. Results: This resistance was carried by a 60 kb plasmid that encoded a $\beta$-lactamase with a pI of 5.4. This $\beta$-lactamase revealed identity with the blaTEM-1 gene encoding the TEM-1 $\beta$-lactamase, except for a replacement of the Val residue at position 84 by Ile, and the Ala residue at position 184 by Val.

Methods: The K. pneumoniae was isolated from sputum specimen in a patient who came from nursing home. The antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by disk diffusion test and the Phoenix NMIC/ID-32 identification system (Becton Dickinson Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, MD). The results were interpreted according to the criteria recommended by the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute 2014. The modified Hodge test (MHT) was performed for the presence of carbapenemase. The carbapenemase genes were confirmed at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), Taiwan. Results: The K. pneumoniae was susceptible to gentamicin, amikacin, andtrimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole, but resistant to piperacillin-tazobactam, levofloxacin, cefuroxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, imipenem, and meropenem. The MHT revealed the presence of a carbapenemase, and then the CDC confirmed that the carbapenemase was KPC. Conclusions: This was the first isolate of KPC-producing strain in this hospital. Especially, the strain was not a hospital-acquired strain, but a nursing home-acquired strain.

We performed susceptibility tests for mupirocin, which is in widespread clinical use in Korea, and four new antimicrobials, daptomycin, linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin and tigecycline, against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium isolated from Korean patients in 1998 and 2005 to evaluate and compare the in vitro activity of these antimicrobials. Among these agents, quinupristin/dalfopristin, which is rarely used in hospitals in Korea, showed relatively high resistance to several vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) isolated in 2005. Likewise, daptomycin, linezolid and tigecycline have not yet been in clinical use in Korea. However, our results showed that most of the 2005 VRE isolates were already resistant to linezolid and daptomycin (highest minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value {\textgreater}100 microg/ml). Compared with the other four antimicrobial agents tested in this study, tigecycline generally showed the greatest activity against VRE. However, four strains of 2005 isolates exhibited resistance against tigecycline (MIC {\textgreater}12.5 microg/ml). Almost all VRE were resistant to mupirocin, whereas all E. faecium isolated in 1998 were inhibited at concentrations between 0.8 to approximately 1.6 microg/ml.

A KPC-2-producing multidrug-resistant (MDR) K. pneumoniae clinical isolate was obtained from a patient admitted to a Korean hospital in 2011. The strain MP14 was resistant to all tested $\beta$-lactams including monobactam, amikacin, levofloxacin, and cotrimoxazole, but susceptible to tigecycline and colistin. Resistome analysis showed the presence of $\beta$-lactamase genes including blaKPC-2, blaSHV-11, blaTEM-169, and blaOXA-9. MP14 also possessed aac(6′-)Ib, aadA2, and aph(3′-)Ia as aminoglycoside resistance-encoding genes, mph(A) for macrolides, oqxA and oqxB for quinolone, catA1 for phenicol, sul1 for sulfonamide, and dfrA12 for trimethoprim.

AIMS: To determine the trend of antibiotic resistance of S. paratyphi A isolates. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: A retrospective study was carried out using blood culture isolates of S. paratyphi A (1991 to 2005) obtained from patients of enteric fever from Asansol and Kolkata and its suburbs (India). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antibiotic susceptibility pattern, using seven antibiotics, for the isolates was determined following agar dilution and disk diffusion methods. Transferability of multidrug resistance to ampicillin (Am), chloramphenicol (Chl), cotrimoxazole (Cot) and tetracycline (Tet) among the isolates was determined by in vitro conjugation. The multi-drug resistant (MDR) and antibiotic susceptible S. paratyphi A strains and the trans-conjugants were screened for the presence of plasmid. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: The t test was used to compare the difference between mean minimum inhibitory concentration values of ciprofloxacin (Cp) for nalidixic acid (Nx)-resistant and Nalidixic acid (Nx)-susceptible isolates. RESULTS: Among 13 outbreak causing isolates in 1991, 9 (69.23{\%}) showed AmChlCotTet-resistance, while 4 (30.77{\%}) Cot-resistance only. During 1992-1994, all 13 isolates were susceptible to Am, Chl, Cot and Tet. During 1995-2005, isolates demonstrated different resistance patterns and emergence of nalidixic acid (Nx)-resistance. A transferable plasmid conferring AmChlCotTet-resistance was detected among MDR isolates. All the isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone (Ctx) and ciprofloxacin (Cp). Association between Nalidixic acid (Nx)-resistance and reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (Cp) among 59 S. paratyphi A isolates was noticed (P {\textless} 0.001). CONCLUSION: Vigilance for R-plasmid and surveillance of antibiotic susceptibility among S. paratyphi A isolates in and around Kolkata, India, are mandatory in order to combat antibiotic resistance of the isolates in this part of the world.",S Mandal and M D Mandal and N K Pal,"0022-3859 (Print)

13495,YES,Mbanga2010,Article,"OBJECTIVE: To obtain data on the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in bacteria isolated from patients with suspected urinary tract infection in Bulawayo province, Zimbabwe. METHOD: Over a period of one year, 257 urine samples were analyzed for bacteria by standard procedures. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of isolated bacteria was done using the disk diffusion method. RESULTS: The isolated bacteria were Escherichia coli (40.3{\%}), coagulase negative Staphylococcus (16.1{\%}), Klebsiella spp (11.2{\%}), Staphylococcus aureus (8{\%}), Group A Streptococcus (8{\%}) and Klebsiella oxytoca (8{\%}). Antibiotic susceptibility testing was done using the disc diffusion method on Mueller-Hinton agar. It revealed a high resistance to ampicillin (84.5{\%}) and cotrimoxazole (68.5{\%}) among the Gram negative bacilli. Gram positive cocci showed resistance to Nalidixic acid (81{\%}) and cotrimoxazole (69{\%}). E. coli was susceptible to most of the drugs but 84{\%} of the strains were resistant to ampicillin, and 68{\%} to cotrimoxazole. All isolates were sensitive to Nicene. CONCLUSION: The high levels of ampicillin and cotrimoxazole resistance in E. coli and other enterobactericiae suggest the need to perform urinalysis and antibiotic susceptibility testing in all patients. Nicene should be considered as the first line therapy for all age groups.

The objectives of this prospective cohort study was to determine the resistance profile of E. coli for two categories of patients ({\textless} 49 years and {\textgreater} or = 50 years), risk factors for ESBL positivity and to investigate the molecular epidemiology of ESBL type CTX-M enzymes. A total of 885 strains of E. coli were isolated in the Infectious Diseases Hospital laboratory between June 2008 and June 2011 and E. coli resistance due to ESBL production was noted in 17{\%} of cases. We found that previous therapy with cephalosporins, hospitalization and urinary catheter were risk factors for ESBL positivity. We noted significant differences concerning resistance rate between patients under 49 years and aged more than 50 years for ciprofloxacin (19{\%} and 38{\%}, respectively, p = 0,0001), for gentamicin (15{\%} and 23{\%}, p = 0,008), ceftazidime (15{\%} and 24{\%}, p = 0,001) and ESBL positivity (14{\%} and 20{\%}, p = 0.009).

15331,MAYBE,OConnor2015,Article,"AIM: To report the first Irish outbreak of cfr-mediated linezolid-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis. METHODS: Linezolid-resistant S. epidermidis isolated at University Hospital Limerick from four blood cultures, one wound and four screening swabs (from nine patients) between April and June 2013 were characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) and staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCCmec) typing. Antibiotic susceptibilities were determined according to the guidelines of the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy. The outbreak was controlled through prohibiting prescription and use of linezolid, adherence to infection prevention and control practices, enhanced environmental cleaning, isolation of affected patients, and hospital-wide education programmes. FINDINGS: PFGE showed that all nine isolates represented a single clonal strain. MLST showed that they belonged to ST2, and SCCmec typing showed that they encoded a variant of SCCmecIII. All nine isolates were cfr positive, and eight isolates were positive for the G2576T 23S rRNA mutation commonly associated with linezolid resistance. Isolates exhibited multiple antibiotic resistances (i.e. linezolid, gentamicin, methicillin, clindamycin, ciprofloxacin, fusidic acid and rifampicin). The adopted infection prevention intervention was effective, and the outbreak was limited to the affected intensive care unit. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first documented outbreak of cfr-mediated linezolid-resistant S. epidermidis in the Republic of Ireland. Despite this, and due to existing outbreak management protocols, the responsible micro-organism and source were identified efficiently. However, it became apparent that staff knowledge of antimicrobial susceptibilities and appropriate hygiene practices were suboptimal at the time of the outbreak, and that educational interventions (and re-inforcement) are necessary to avoid occurrence of antimicrobial resistance and outbreaks such as reported here.",C O'Connor and J Powell and C Finnegan and A O'Gorman and S Barrett and K L Hopkins and B Pichon and R Hill and L Power and N Woodford and J C Coffey and A Kearns and N H O'Connell and C P Dunne,0195-6701,J Hosp Infect,"*Cross Infection/epidemiology/microbiology/prevent,23S rRNA methyltransferase,Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology,Disease Outbreaks/prevention {\&} control,Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial/drug effects/,Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field,Female,First outbreak,Hospitals, Teaching,Humans,Incidence,Infection Control/*methods,Ireland,Ireland/epidemiology,Linezolid/pharmacology,Male,Middle Aged,Multi-resistance,Mutation,Oxazolidinone resistance,Plasmid-mediated,RNA, Ribosomal, 23S,Staphylococcal Infections/drug therapy/*epidemiolo,Staphylococci,Staphylococcus epidermidis/*drug effects/genetics/,Treatment Outcome",316--321,"{Incidence, management and outcomes of the first cfr-mediated linezolid-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis outbreak in a tertiary referral centre in the Republic of Ireland}",NA,90,2015,4,"1532-2939

We analyzed 65 (54 nonreplicate) Acinetobacter isolates from 48 patients (46 hospitalized and 2 outpatient trainees entering the military) from October 2004 to October 2005 for genotypic similarities, time-space relatedness, and antibiotic susceptibility. Clinical and surveillance cultures were compared by amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) genomic fingerprinting to each other and to strains of a reference database. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined, and multiplex PCR was performed for OXA-23-like, -24-like, -51-like, and -58-like carbapenemases. Records were reviewed for overlapping hospital stays of the most frequent genotypes, and risk ratios were calculated for any association of genotype with severity of Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score or injury severity score (ISS) and previous antibiotic use. Nineteen genotypes were identified; two predominated, one consistent with an emerging novel international clone and the other unique to our database. Both predominant genotypes were carbapenem resistant, were present at another hospital before patients' admission to our facility, and were associated with higher APACHE II scores, higher ISSs, and previous carbapenem antibiotics in comparison with other genotypes. One predominated in wound and respiratory isolates, and the other predominated in wound and skin surveillance samples. Several other genotypes were identified as European clones I to III. Acinetobacter genotypes from recruits upon entry to the military, unlike those in hospitalized patients, did not include carbapenem-resistant genotypes. Acinetobacter species isolated from battlefield casualties are diverse, including genotypes belonging to European clones I to III. Two carbapenem-resistant genotypes were epidemic, one of which appeared to belong to a novel international clone.",K Petersen and S C Cannegieter and T J {van der Reijden} and B {Van Strijen} and D M You and B S Babel and A I Philip and L Dijkshoorn,"0095-1137

16481,MAYBE,Pfeifer2013,Article,"We report the emergence of a multidrug-resistant Haemophilus influenzae strain in a patient with common variable immunodeficiency suffering from recurrent bronchopneumonia caused by H. influenzae. After the patient had received several antibiotic therapies, a strain was isolated showing resistance to ampicillin, ampicillin/sulbactam, cefazolin, cefuroxime, ciprofloxacin, and clarithromycin. Polymerase chain reaction analyses and sequencing revealed the presence of the beta-lactamase gene blaTEM-1, two mutations (A502T and R517H) in the ftsI gene encoding the transpeptidase region of the penicillin-binding protein 3, and one mutation in the ribosomal protein gene L4 (G65D) conferring resistance to beta-lactams and macrolides, respectively. Additionally, the plasmid-encoded aac(6′)-Ib-cr gene mediating slightly reduced susceptibility to quinolones and two mutations in the DNA gyrase gene gyrA and one mutation in the topoisomerase IV gene parC were identified leading to a high-level fluoroquinolone-resistant phenotype. In conclusion, the treatment of H. influenzae infections accompanied by high bacterial loads such as bronchopneumonia can be complicated by the selection of multidrug-resistant strains. Moreover, the emergence of aac(6′)-Ib-cr in H. influenzae causing low fluoroquinolone resistance levels might have contributed to the selection of DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV mutants. {\textcopyright} Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2013.",Y Pfeifer and I Meisinger and K Brechtel and S Gröbner,"1076-6294

17489,MAYBE,Resende2014,Article,"INTRODUCTION: In Porto Alegre (South Brazil), since the first VRE isolation in 2000 until the middle of the last decade, the epidemiology of enterococcal infections presented the peculiarity that, as opposed to other regions of the country, almost all VRE were E. faecalis. The aim of this study was to investigate the microbiological and epidemiological characteristics of a VRE outbreak that occurred between August 2010 and September 2011 in Porto Alegre, South Brazil. METHODOLOGY: Twenty-nine isolates from inpatients of Mae de Deus Hospital that were identified and characterized for their susceptibility profile, vancomycin genotype, presence of esp gene, biofilm production, and clonal relationship were collected. Patients' records were reviewed for clinical information. RESULTS: All isolates were identified as vancomycin/ampicillin resistant E. faecium carrying the vanA gene. Almost all were susceptible to gentamicin and streptomycin. Most patients died and were associated with a hemodialysis unit stay. All but the first isolate were clustered in a main clone. CONCLUSIONS: An important change in vancomycin-resistant enterococci was observed.

Methods: The collection studied included 10 sequential isolates from each of 10 CF patients. Each sequential isolate was separated by at least a 6-month interval, covering up to an 8-year period from 2003 to 2010. Colony morphotypes were recorded, and antibiotic susceptibility profiles (ceftazidime, cefepime, imipenem, meropenem, ciprofloxacin, tobramycin, and colistin) were determined by E-test, using EUCAST breakpoints. All isolates were typed by Pulsed-Field-Gel- Electrophoresis (PFGE) using SpeI as restriction enzyme. One representative isolate from each clone and patient was further analysed by Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) using available protocols and databases (http://pubmlst.org/paeruginosa/). Results: Following PFGE results, 17 strains were analysed by MLST, leading to the identification of 14 sequence types (ST), eight of which (57{\%}) were new. One of them (ST-274), was detected in three patients, and one more patient harboured a closely related clone differing only by single point mutations in two alleles. Remarkably, ST-274 has been also detected (MLST database) in several CF patients from Australia, Austria, and France. Two other patients shared the same clone (ST- 299), whereas all other clones were found in single patients. In five of the patients a single clone was detected through the whole study period, remarkably including all four patients with ST-274 or the related clone. The remaining five patients showed the coexistence of several clones (2-4) or clonal replacements, including the superinfection with the Liverpool Epidemic Strain (LES-1, ST-146) in one of the patients. An important intra and inter clonal and patient variability of resistance patterns was documented, but with a significant trend towards the accumulation of resistance mechanisms, as evidenced by an average resistance to 0.7 antibiotics in the initial isolates from each patient compared to 2.0 in the last isolates. Conclusion: Despite not particularly associated to resistance, this work alerts on the linkage to persistent colonization and wide dissemination among CF patients of ST-274.

METHOD: This retrospective study included 300 strains of S. agalactiae from several pathological samples collected at the Monastir Fattouma Borguiba Hospital. The identification was based on conventional bacteriological features. Serogrouping was performed using agglutination tests. The susceptibility to antibiotics was studied according to the Antibiogram Committee of the French Society of Microbiology recommendations. RESULTS: S. agalactiae was mainly isolated from patients with vaginal infections (31.3{\%}) and urinary tract infections (24.7{\%}). All strains were susceptible to penicillin G. Resistance was mostly observed to erythromycin (38.5{\%}) and lincomycin (36.6{\%}). 6.5{\%} were highly resistant to kanamycin and 0.6{\%} to gentamicin.

Although the pathogenic features of M. wisconsensis are not completely explained in humans, it is associated with diarrhea and acute cholecystitis with or without secondary bacteremia only in a few cases. In this report, a case of central venous catheter-related bloodstream infection caused by M. wisconsensis is presented. A 53-year-old female patient with chronic renal failure was admitted to our hospital with the complaints of fever, anorexia and weakness for seven days. Physical examination revealed redness and tenderness at and around hemodialysis catheter insertion site. Empirical antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone and vancomycin was initiated owing to high suspicion of catheter-related infection. Isolate from the patient's peripheral and catheter blood cultures was identified as M. wisconsensis by Phoenix 100 (Becton Dickinson Co., Sparks, MD, USA) automated system and, was found susceptible to ampicillin-sulbactam, imipenem, meropenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime and trimethoprim-sulphametoxazole, whereas resistant to amikacin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, cefoxitin, aztreonam, ceftriaxone and ceftazidime. Identification was confirmed by BD BBL Crystal GN (Becton Dickinson Co., Sparks, MD, USA) identification system. Other distant infectious focuses explaining the positive blood culture result were not determined.

19575,YES,Soes2009a,Article,"Increasing rates of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) with an unusual, severe course have been reported in several countries; this rise has partly been ascribed to the emergence of a virulent strain, C. difficile PCR ribotype 027 (CD027). An intriguing question is whether this could be related to increasing consumption of broadspectrum antibiotics. From 1997 to 2007, the number of hospital discharges in Denmark with the diagnosis enterocolitis caused by C. difficile increased from eight to 23 per 100,000 hospital discharges. This increase was proportional to a concomitant rise in the consumption of fluoroquinolones and cephalosporins. The first outbreak of CD027 in Denmark occurred from October 2006 to August 2007 and included 13 patients, most of them elderly, admitted to three hospitals in the same region. Most of the patients had overlapping periods of admission. All patients had been treated with broadspectrum antibiotics, in particular cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones, prior to positive culture of CD027. 30 days after confirmation of diagnosis, three of the 13 patients had died. Taken together, the data support the hypothesis that the increasing use of certain broadspectrum antibiotics may be related to a possible increase of C. difficile infection, and show that the specific contribution by CD027 in its emergence needs to be determined.",L Soes and K Molbak and S Strobaek and K {Truberg Jensen} and M Torpdahl and S Persson and M Kemp and K E Olsen,1025-496x,Euro Surveill,"Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Cephalosporins/administration {\&} dosage/*adverse ef,Clostridium difficile/drug effects/*genetics,Denmark,Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial/drug effects/,Enterocolitis, Pseudomembranous/chemically induced,Female,Fluoroquinolones/administration {\&} dosage/*adverse,Humans,Male,Middle Aged,Retrospective Studies,Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*t,Ribotyping/*trends",NA,{The emergence of Clostridium difficile PCR ribotype 027 in Denmark--a possible link with the increased consumption of fluoroquinolones and cephalosporins?},NA,14,2009,15,"1560-7917

19607,YES,Sole2011a,Article,"Objectives: Metallo-$\beta$-lactamases (MBL) are important enzymes that hydrolyze all $\beta$-lactam antibiotics except aztreonam. Recently, a Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate carrying a novel carbapenemase, named NDM-1, was identified from a Swedish patient transferred from India. In this study, we report the first description of an E. coli strain producing NDM-1 in Spain. Methods: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by BD Phoenix and Etest. Hodge and Imipenem-EDTA Etest synergy tests were used to screen for MBL production. Detection of genes encoding carbapenemases (VIM, IMP, NDM), ESBLs, plasmid-mediated cephalosporinases, armA (to investigate aminoglycoside resistance) as well as genes encoding heat-stable (ST), heat-labile (LT) toxins, verotoxins (VT) and enteroaggregative E. coli virulence factors was performed by PCR and sequence analysis. Conjugative transfer between DVR22 and E. coli J53 was done by conventional biparental mating. Plasmid analysis was performed both to the NDM-1 bearing strain and selected transconjugants. After a four month period another stool specimen from the same patient was screened to detect NDM-1 carriage. Results: A carbapenem-resistant E. coli (DVR22) was recovered from a stool specimen from a patient with traveller's diarrhoea who had travelled to India. The DVR22 strain was resistant to all antibiotics tested except tigecycline, fosfomycin and colistin. MICs of carbapenems were as follows: imipenem (8 $\mu$g/ml), meropenem (8 mu;g/ml), ertapenem (24 mu;g/ml) and doripenem (6 mu;g/ml). Hodge and Imipenem-EDTA Etest synergy tests were positive. PCR and sequencing identified the presence of genes encoding NDM-1, DHA, CTX-M-15, TEM-1 and armA genes. E. coli transconjugants showed resistance to aminoglycosides and all $\beta$-lactam antibiotics and were positive for NDM-1, CTX-M-15, DHA, TEM-1 and armA genes. Plasmid analysis revealed that E. coli transconjugants harboured a circa 180-kb plasmid. PCR screening of genes encoding virulence factors of diarrhoeagenic E. coli was negative. Four months later the DVR22 strain was no longer isolated from the stool of this patient. Conclusions: This is the first isolation of an NDM-1 metallo-$\beta$-lactamase in Spain. The location of NDM-1 in a conjugative plasmid increases the risk of dissemination and transfer to other bacteria. Our results, however, suggest that this strain does not persist long in the intestinal tract, most likely due to the fitness cost associated with the conjugative plasmid.",M M Solé and C Pitart and P Salvador and L M͡noz and I Oliveira and J Gascón and I Roca and A {Fàbrega} and F Marco and J Vila,1198-743X,Clinical Microbiology and Infection,"Escherichia coli,India,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Spain,aminoglycoside,antibiotic agent,antibiotic sensitivity,aztreonam,bacterium,beta lactam antibiotic,carbapenem,carbapenem derivative,carbapenemase,colistin,diarrhea,diarrheagenic Escherichia coli,doripenem,edetic acid,enteroaggregative Escherichia coli,enzyme,epsilometer test,ertapenem,fitness,fosfomycin,gene,heat,human,imipenem,inosine phosphate,intestine,mating,meropenem,patient,penicillinase,plasmid,risk,screening,sequence analysis,tigecycline,toxin,travel,virulence factor",S139,{First description of an Escherichia coli strain producing NDM-1 carbapenemase in Spain},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L70599321 http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-0691.2011.03558.x http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=1198743X{\&}id=doi:10.1111{\%}2Fj.1469-0691.2011.03558.x{\&}atitle=F,17,2011,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,YES,Jake,YES,Nchedo,Nchedo,Zach,yes,,

20086,MAYBE,Subramanian2016,Article,"Purpose: blaNDM genes are MBL genes that confer resistance to carbapenems. Globally, they are associated with diverse clones and plasmids. In this study, we characterised three isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae-harbouring blaNDM1 from patients undergoing chronic haemodialysis and renal transplantation. Materials and Methods: 3 blaNDM1 -producing K. pneumoniae were isolated from end-stage renal disease patients undergoing haemodialysis and renal transplantation from a nephrology unit. All the three isolates were screened for clinically relevant resistant genes. Plasmid replicon content was analysed by polymerase chain reaction based replicon typing. Conjugation assays were done using azide-resistant Escherichia coli J53 as the recipient strain. Multilocus sequence typing and variable number tandem repeat typing were done to find the clonality. Replicon sequence based typing was attempted to find the diversity of replicon-associated sequences in IncHI3 plasmids. Results: All the 3 blaNDM positive isolates possessed the New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) allele with an IncHI3 plasmid which was not transferable in one isolate. The isolates were found to be sequence type 14 (ST14; 2 nos) and ST38 both of which were previously reported to be the NDM-producing K. pneumoniae STs prevalent in India. Replicon sequence analysis revealed limited sequence diversity within the repHI3 and repFIB locus. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of IncHI3, a newly assigned enterobacterial plasmid incompatibility group from India.

METHODS: A total of 44 Shigella isolates were collected from Iranian patients admitted to Milad Hospital, Tehran, Iran, during 2008-10. Of these, 37 were serotyped and characterized by MIC determination. A subset of eight suspected extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers (six Shigella sonnei phase II and two Shigella flexneri type 1b) were examined for the presence of genes encoding cephalosporin resistance. The presence of PMQR was assessed in one S. flexneri isolate exhibiting low-level resistance to ciprofloxacin and susceptibility to nalidixic acid. PFGE was performed on 25 S. sonnei phase II isolates. RESULTS: Of the isolates, 25 (68{\%}) were S. sonnei phase II, with 5 (14{\%}) S. flexneri, 5 (14{\%}) Shigella dysenteriae type 2, and 2 (5{\%}) Shigella boydii type 2. Resistance to at least threeclasses of antimicrobials was detected in all species. The presence of bla(CTX-M-15) and the AmpC beta-lactamase producer bla(CMY-2) was confirmed in five and one S. sonnei phase II isolates, respectively. One of the two S. flexneri type 1b that contained bla(CTX-M-15) also harboured a qnrS1 gene. PFGE identified sevenPFGE profiles; the main cluster included 15 of the strains, suggesting low genetic diversity between isolates or the presence of an endemic clone in Iran. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first known description of ESBL-producing and AmpC beta-lactamase-producing Shigella and of PMQR Shigella in Iran. The emergence of CTX-15, CMY-2 and qnrS1 genes may compromise the treatment of shigellosis.

The patient was hospitalized in medical oncology clinic with complaints of weight loss, nausea and vomiting for one year. Since she had problems of consiousness, dysphagia and pitosis, lumbar puncture was performed to rule out central nervous system infection or metastasis. Cryptococcal meningitis was diagnosed upon the examination of Indian-ink stained smear of cerebrospinal fluid and amphotericin B was initiated. On the 11th day of her follow up, she developed respiratory distress and was transferred to pulmonary intensive care and underwent invasive mechanical ventilator (IMV) therapy. On the 4th day of IMV; a new infiltration was detected on the upper zone of chest X-ray in addition to fever (38.3 degrees C) and intense endotracheal secretion. Therefore, bronchoscopic examination was performed and bronchoalveolar lavage and bronchoscope aspiration materials were obtained and cultivated. Bacteria grown at blood agar and EMB agar after 48 hours of incubation were stained as gram-negative bacilli and identified as C. pauculus by VITEK 2 compact system (bioMerieux Inc, USA). The strain was susceptible to ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, piperacilin/tazobactam and resistant to amikacin. The case was considered as C. pauculus VAP and imipenem (500 mg, 4 x 1) for 14 days was initiated. Clinical and microbiological resolution was achieved by imipenem therapy. In conclusion, rare pathogens like C. pauculus should be considered among the possible causative agents in infections that develop in immunocompromised host.",M S Tasbakan and T Yamazhan and S Aydemir and F Bacakoglu,"0374-9096 (Print)

21083,YES,Trevino2010a,Article,"Nosocomial infections caused by multidrug-resistant and carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas putida isolates have been reported occasionally in severely ill or immunocompromised patients. Here we report the microbiological characteristics of what are believed to be the two first carbapenem-resistant VIM metallo-$\beta$-lactamase (MBL)-producing P. putida strains in Spain, which were isolated from patients at the University Hospital Complex of Santiago de Compostela. Both patients were immunocompromised with severe underlying diseases and had been hospitalized for more than 15 days. One of them had previously been treated with a broad-spectrum therapy. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed that both strains were resistant to piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftazidime, cefepime, imipenem, meropenem, gentamicin, tobramycin, aztreonam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxacin, but sensitive to amikacin and colistin. For both isolates PCR and sequencing was positive for the blaVIM-2 gene. Fingerprinting analysis revealed these were two different strains. One patient recovered clinically and one died; no direct link could be established between the isolation of P. putida and death. Our data expose the emergence of multidrug-resistant P. putida VIM-2 MBL, probably arising by independent horizontal transfer of resistance genes. So, although P. putida is not frequently isolated, it may survive easily in the hospital setting and occasionally cause difficult-to-treat nosocomial infections in severely ill patients. {\textcopyright} 2010 SGM.",M Treviño and L Moldes and M Hernández and L Mart\'{i}nez-Lamas and C Garc\'{i}a-Riestra and B J Regueiro,0022-2615,Journal of Medical Microbiology,"DNA fingerprinting,Pseudomonas putida,Spain,aged,amikacin,antibiotic sensitivity,article,aztreonam,bacterial strain,bacterium isolate,carbapenem,case report,cefepime,ceftazidime,ceftriaxone,ciprofloxacin,colistin,cotrimoxazole,disease severity,female,gene sequence,gentamicin,hospital infection,human,imipenem,immunocompromised patient,male,meropenem,metallo beta lactamase,nonhuman,piperacillin plus tazobactam,polymerase chain reaction,priority journal,single drug dose,survival,tobramycin",853--855,{Nosocomial infection by VIM-2 metallo-$\beta$-lactamase-producing Pseudomonas putida},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L359158120 http://dx.doi.org/10.1099/jmm.0.018036-0 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=00222615{\&}id=doi:10.1099{\%}2Fjmm.0.018036-0{\&}atitle=Nosocomial+infection,59,2010,7,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,YES,Erica,NO,Mushtaq,Allison,Zach,yes,,

Herein we report the results of the subsequent investigation. DESIGN AND METHODS: The investigation included environmental cultures for source investigation, molecular analysis by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to reveal the identity of the strains, and determination of the bactericidal activity of the glutaraldehyde-based disinfectant used for automated endoscope reprocessing. In addition, patient outcome was analyzed by medical chart review, and incidence rates of clinical samples with P. aeruginosa were compared. SETTING: The University Hospital of Basel is an 855-bed tertiary care center in Basel, Switzerland. Approximately 1,700 flexible bronchoscopic, 2,500 gastroscopic, 1,400 colonoscopic, 140 endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographic, and 140 endosonographic procedures are performed annually. RESULTS: P. aeruginosa was detected in samples obtained from endoscopes in November 2009 for the first time since the initiation of surveillance in 2006. It was found in the rinsing water and in the drain of 1 of the 2 automated endoscope reprocessors. PFGE revealed 2 distinct P. aeruginosa strains, one in each reprocessor. The glutaraldehyde-based disinfectant showed no activity against the 2 pseudo-outbreak strains when used in the recommended concentration under standard conditions. After medical chart review, 6 patients with lower respiratory tract and bloodstream infections were identified as having a possible epidemiological link to the pseudo-outbreak strain.

Methods: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed on bacterial isolates using the Microscan Walkaway system (Siemens, Germany) and was confirmed by Etest (AB Biodisk, Sweden). bla-CTX-M, -SHV, -TEM, -OXA-48, OXA-A,B,C,D, -KPC, -NDM, -VIM, -IMP, integron 1, and outer membrane proteins(Omp)-35 and Omp-36 were investigated by PCR amplification and direct sequencing of PCR products. Isolates were sequence-typed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Results: All isolates were resistant to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, and piperacillin-tazobactam, and 91{\%} (21 out of 23) were resistant to amikacin and gentamicin. All isolates except two from a single patient were resistant to one of the carbapenems. CTX-M and SHV genes were detected in all isolates, CTX-M-15 and SHV-1 types being predominant among these extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). TEM-1 was found in all except one isolate (isolate 3). Significantly, the OXA-48 gene was also found in all isolates. OXA-D-gene was found in three out of 23 isolates. KPC, NDM, OXA-A, -B, -C, VIM, and IMP genes were absent in all isolates. Disruption of the Omp-36 gene due to insertion of transposon IS903 and/or IS4 was detected in four out of 23 isolates, and some unique variations were also observed in this gene, including an insertion of two amino acids in the L3 region of Omp-36 in one isolate (isolate 3) and a mutation resulting in a premature stop codon in another isolate (isolate 25). MLST revealed ST29 to be the predominant sequence type (17 out of 23 isolates, 74{\%}). Three were ST709 and one each was ST37 and ST111; one isolate had an unknown ST. Conclusions: This is probably the first reported outbreak of multidrug/carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella infection involving the OXA-48 gene from Saudi Arabia. Although the presence of ESBLs such as OXA, CTX-M, TEM, and SHV are predictable reasons for resistance, variations in the Omp-36 gene might also have precipitated this phenomenon. Disruption of the Omp-36 sequence by large insertional elements, the insertion of two amino acids in a very crucial part of this protein, and the presence of a premature stop codon in one isolate might have rendered this protein incomplete and non-functional. The study also demonstrated that more than one type of clone was responsible for this reported apparent outbreak and that ST29, a clone not reported from this region before, was the major clone responsible.",T {Uz Zaman} and M Aldrees and S M {Al Johani} and M Alrodayyan and F A Aldughashem and H H Balkhy,1201-9712,Int J Infect Dis,",*Disease Outbreaks,Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology,Bacterial,Bacterial Outer Membrane Proteins/chemistry,Bacterial/genetics,Carbapenem resistance,Carbapenems/*pharmacology,Drug Resistance,Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases,Genes,Genetic Variation,Humans,Klebsiella Infections/*epidemiology/*microbiology,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Klebsiella pneumoniae infection,Klebsiella pneumoniae/*drug effects/genetics/isola,Multiple,OXA 48 gene,Outer membrane protein,Saudi Arabia,Tertiary Care Centers,amikacin,antibiotic resistance,article,bacterium isolate,beta lactamase TEM 1,beta-Lactamases/*genetics,carbapenem,cefepime,cefotaxime,ceftazidime,ciprofloxacin,clinical article,controlled study,gene,gene mutation,gene sequence,genetic variability,gentamicin,human,multilocus sequence typing,piperacillin,piperacillin plus tazobactam,prematurity,stop codon,tertiary care center,transposon",e186--e192,"{Multi-drug carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae infection carrying the OXA-48 gene and showing variations in outer membrane protein 36 causing an outbreak in a tertiary care hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia}",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L601592827 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2014.05.021 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=18783511{\&}id=doi:10.1016{\%}2Fj.ijid.2014.05.021{\&}atitle=Multi-drug+c,28,2014,NA,"From Duplicate 2 (Multi-drug carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae infection carrying the OXA-48 gene and showing variations in outer membrane protein 36 causing an outbreak in a tertiary care hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia - Uz Zaman, T; Aldrees, M; Al Johani, S M; Alrodayyan, M; Aldughashem, F A; Balkhy, H H)

Methods: Data from the OLV hospital, a 939-bed, university-affiliated teaching hospital in Belgium, were used. The study period ran from 2006 to 2009. All respiratory tract samples, positive for MRSA, were retrospectively collected from the automated microbiology database. As multiple samples per patient were available during follow-up, only the first MRSA respiratory tract sample was considered. Of all patients with MRSA positive respiratory tract samples, the complete medical records, including chest X-ray or chest CT scans were reviewed by a pulmonologist. Patients were defined to have pneumonia according to the ECDC criteria. Risk factors such as comorbidity and previous use of antibiotics were studied. Results: During follow-up, 197 patients with a MRSA positive respiratory tract sample were identified. 46 of these 197 patients developed an MRSA pneumonia of which 30 had a nosocomial pneumonia. The overall incidence of MRSA pneumonia was 0.49/10000 patient days. 25 of the 46 MRSA pneumonia were detected at ICU. In patients with MRSA pneumonia, the mortality was high, 24 of the 46 patients (52{\%}) died during follow-up versus 32{\%} in patients with MRSA colonization of the respiratory tract was 32{\%}. The mean time from admission to MRSA pneumonia was 13.6 days. 50{\%} of patients with MRSA pneumonia were previously (during current hospital admission) treated with an antibiotic vs 32.5{\%} in MRSA colonized patients.

21975,MAYBE,Vosoghi2010,Article,"Rhodococcus species are rare human pathogens. Most cases of human infection have involved Rhodococcus equi, a natural zoonotic pathogen causing pneumonia in young foals. The human population at risk mainly includes immunocompromised patients. Infection of immunocompetent hosts has been rare, with less than 30 reported cases in the literature. The authors report a first case of recurrent Rhodococcus gordoniae granulomatous lower eyelid infection that occurred after an immunocompetent 44-year-old woman underwent a combined intranasal and lower blepharoplasty procedure. A literature search revealed only 10 reported cases of non-R. equi rhodococcal infections, most involving traumatic inoculation; 5 of these cases involved the eye and ocular adnexa. To the author's knowledge, this is the first case report of a non-R. equi rhodococcal infection of the eyelids.

21980,YES,Voulgari2014,Article,"OBJECTIVES: Despite the fact that the NDM-1 carbapenemase has successfully disseminated worldwide, outbreaks remain uncommon in the European region. We describe the characteristics of the first outbreaks caused by NDM-1-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae clonal isolates in Greece. METHODS: Between January 2010 and June 2013, 132 non-repetitive carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates, which gave a positive modified Hodge test and were phenotypically suspected of metallo-beta-lactamase production, were recovered from patients hospitalized at Ioannina University Hospital. Resistance genes were identified by PCR and sequencing. Plasmid profiling, conjugation experiments, enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus PCR, PFGE and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) were performed. Patient records were retrieved to access patterns of acquisition. RESULTS: Molecular testing verified the presence in 78 K. pneumoniae isolates, collected from 71 patients, of the blaNDM-1 gene. The blaCTX-M-15, blaOXA-1 and blaTEM-1 genes were also present in most isolates. The blaNDM-1 gene was located on a narrow host range IncFII-type plasmid, of approximately 95 kb, flanked upstream by a non-truncated ISAba125 element and downstream by the bleMBL gene. Genotyping clustered all K. pneumoniae isolates into a single clonal type with one subtype and MLST assigned them to sequence type 11. Two outbreaks were noted, the first between November and December 2011 involving four patients and the second initiated in May 2012 and ongoing, involving the remaining patients. All but two cases were characterized as hospital acquired. No links to immigration or travel history to endemic areas were established. CONCLUSIONS: This survey highlights the successful undetected dissemination of yet another carbapenemase in Greece and strengthens the hypothesis of a latent NDM-1 cluster in the Balkan region.",E Voulgari and C Gartzonika and G Vrioni and L Politi and E Priavali and S Levidiotou-Stefanou and A Tsakris,"1460-2091

22207,MAYBE,Wang2014o,Article,"Objective: This study aimed to investigate the clinical and microbiological features of recurrent group B streptococcal (GBS) diseases among non-pregnant adults. Methods: All hospitalized non-pregnant adults who had culture-proven GBS infections between January 2008 and December 2010 were enrolled in this retrospective study. Bacterial isolates were examined for their serotypes, genotypes, and antimicrobial resistance. Results: The recurrence rate of GBS infection in Taiwan was found to be 9.3{\%}. Of the 70 recurrent episodes in 32 patients, infections of the urinary tract (U) were diagnosed clinically in 55.7{\%}, infections of the soft tissue (S) in 31.4{\%}, and infections of the bloodstream (B) in 12.9{\%}. The initial/recurrent episodes in 25 patients were mainly U/U (40.6{\%}), followed by S/S (18.8{\%}) and B/B (6.2{\%}). The serotypes/serogroups identified were serotypes V (34.3{\%}), Ib (22.9{\%}), VI (17.1{\%}), III (12.9{\%}), IV (7.1{\%}), and Ia (5.7{\%}). Recurrent strains showed less resistance to erythromycin or clindamycin than non-recurrent strains. Six distinct genotypes were identified in 12 serotype VI isolates derived from seven patients; five of these isolate pairs had identical genotypes. Conclusions: Recurrent GBS diseases were found to occur considerably more often than previously thought, mainly in adults with a high comorbid index. Relapse, not new acquisition, was found to be more common. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.",Y H Wang and H M Chen and Y H Yang and T H Yang and C H Teng and C L Chen and C Chu and C H Chiu,1201-9712,Int J Infect Dis,",*Streptococcus agalactiae/classification/drug effe,Adult,Aged,Antimicrobial resistance,Bacterial,Charlson Comorbidity Index,Drug Resistance,Female,Genotype,Group B streptococci,Humans,Male,Middle Aged,Recurrence,Recurrent,Retrospective Studies,Serogroup,Serotype,Serotyping,Streptococcal Infections/*diagnosis/*microbiology,Taiwan,adult,antibiotic resistance,antibiotic sensitivity,antimicrobial therapy,article,bacteremia,bacterium culture,bloodstream infection,cephalosporin derivative,clindamycin,clinical feature,diabetes mellitus,diabetic patient,erythromycin,female,genotype,group B streptococcal infection,human,lincosamide,macrolide,major clinical study,male,microbiology,mikamycin B,penicillin derivative,peptic ulcer,phenotype,prevalence,purification,recurrence risk,recurrent infection,retrospective study,risk factor,serotype,soft tissue infection,urinary tract infection",e140--e145,{Clinical and microbiological characteristics of recurrent group B streptococcal infection among non-pregnant adults},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L373727517 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2014.05.026 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=18783511{\&}id=doi:10.1016{\%}2Fj.ijid.2014.05.026{\&}atitle=Clinical+and,26,2014,NA,"From Duplicate 1 (Clinical and microbiological characteristics of recurrent group B streptococcal infection among non-pregnant adults - Wang, Y H; Chen, H M; Yang, Y H; Yang, T H; Teng, C H; Chen, C L; Chu, C; Chiu, C H)

We suspected that USA300 had been introduced into our burn-trauma unit (BTU) when three burn patients presented with numerous simultaneous abscesses. We did molecular typing on 206 MRSA isolates from all patients on the BTU who had MRSA isolated from either nares cultures or clinical specimens obtained between April 11, 2002 and October 24, 2006. We reviewed medical records for all patients who had USA300 and for 75 control patients. Twenty-five of 206 (12.1{\%}) patients who were colonized (n = 3) or infected (n = 22) with MRSA had USA300. Thirteen patients had abscesses drained surgically and eight had necrotizing fasciitis excised. Seven patients had burns (mean burn size 11.8 +/- 3.4{\%}), of who four (66.7{\%}) acquired numerous simultaneous (3-33) abscesses. Fourteen patients acquired USA300 outside of the BTU, and three acquired this strain on the BTU. Cases were more likely to have been hospitalized or to have had an operation in the 6 months before they were hospitalized than were controls (P = .001 for both). To our knowledge, this is the first study to describe numerous simultaneous MRSA abscesses in burn patients. The MRSA strain USA300 may be introduced onto burn units from the community by patients admitted with skin and soft tissue infections, especially abscesses and necrotizing fasciitis.

In Japan, bla (NDM-1)-carrying Escherichia coli was first described in 2010. In this study, we characterized NDM-1-positive Klebsiella pneumoniae strain 419 in Japan, which was isolated from the urine of a 90-year-old Japanese patient who had never been to the Indian subcontinent. K. pneumoniae 419 belonged to ST42. It possessed a surface capsule (with untypeable capsular PCR types) and was resistant to serum killing. K. pneumoniae 419 cells were occasionally flagellated or piliated and autoaggregated. K. pneumoniae 419 was resistant to beta-lactams (including carbapenems), aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones, and was susceptible to imipenem (or biapenem), aztreonam, polymixin B, and colistin. It possessed at least eight plasmids; of those, a 74-kb plasmid (pKPJ1) of the replicon FIIA carried bla (NDM-1) and was conjugally transferred to E. coli strains, with a 71-kb transferable azithromycin-resistant (mphA (+)) plasmid of the replicon F (pKPJ2), as a large (145-kb) plasmid (pKPJF100) through a transposition event. In addition to bla (NDM-1), pKPJ1 carried arr-2, pKPJ2 carried mphA, and pKPJF100 carried both. They were negative for the 16S rRNA methylase gene, e.g., which is frequently associated with bla (NDM-1). The data demonstrate that K. pneumoniae 419 possessed virulence- and fitness-associated surface structures, was resistant to serum killing, and possessed a unique (or rare) genetic background in terms of ST type and bla (NDM-1)-carrying plasmid.",T Yamamoto and T Takano and T Fusegawa and T Shibuya and W C Hung and W Higuchi and Y Iwao and O Khokhlova and I Reva,1341-321x,J Infect Chemother,"Adult,Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology,Azithromycin/pharmacology,Blood Bactericidal Activity,Conjugation, Genetic,Drug Resistance, Bacterial/genetics,Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial/genetics,Humans,Japan/epidemiology,Klebsiella Infections/epidemiology/microbiology,Klebsiella pneumoniae/*genetics/isolation {\&} purifi,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Microscopy, Electron,Plasmids/*genetics,Urinary Tract Infections/microbiology,Urine/microbiology,beta-Lactam Resistance,beta-Lactamases/*biosynthesis/genetics",118--127,"{Electron microscopic structures, serum resistance, and plasmid restructuring of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1)-producing ST42 Klebsiella pneumoniae emerging in Japan}",NA,19,2013,1,"1437-7780

23022,MAYBE,Yayan2015,Article,"Klebsiella species are a common cause of community- and nosocomial-acquired pneumonia. Antibiotic resistance to the class of carbapenem in patients with pneumonia caused by Klebsiella species is unusual. New studies report carbapenem resistance in patients with pneumonia caused by Klebsiella species.This article examines, retrospectively, antibiotic resistance in patients with community- and nosocomial-acquired pneumonia caused by Klebsiella species.The data of all patients with community- and nosocomial-acquired pneumonia caused by Klebsiella species were collected from the hospital charts at the HELIOS Clinic, Witten/Herdecke University, Wuppertal, Germany, within the study period 2004 to 2014. An antibiogram was created from all of the study patients with pneumonia caused by Klebsiella species. Sensitivity and resistance profiles were performed for the different antibiotics that have been consistently used in the treatment of patients with pneumonia caused by Klebsiella species. All demographic, clinical, and laboratory data of all of the patients with pneumonia caused by Klebsiella species were collected from the patients' records.During the study period of January 1, 2004, to August 12, 2014, 149 patients were identified with community- and nosocomial-acquired pneumonia affected by Klebsiella species. These patients had a mean age of 70.6 +/- 13 (107 [71.8{\%}, 95{\%} CI 64.6{\%}-79{\%}] men and 42 [28.2{\%}, 95{\%} CI 21{\%}-35.4{\%}] women). In all of the patients with pneumonia caused by Klebsiella species, there was resistance to ampicillin (P {\textless} 0.0001). Many patients with pneumonia caused by Klebsiella species (75.3{\%}) also showed resistance to piperacillin (P {\textless} 0.0001).

Antibiotic susceptibility testing and phenotypic screening for ESBLs and MBLs were performed on 122 P. aeruginosa isolates collected in the period from January 2011 to March 2012. MICs were determined. ESBLs and MBLs genes were sought by PCR. The resistant rate to imipenem was 39.34{\%}. The resistance rates for P. aeruginosa to cefuroxime, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, aztreonam, and piperacillin/tazobactam were 87.7{\%}, 80.3{\%}, 60.6{\%}, 45.1{\%}, and 25.4{\%}, respectively. Out of 122 P. aeruginosa, 27{\%} and 7.4{\%} were MBL and ESBL, respectively. The prevalence of bla(VIM-2), bla(OXA-10(-)), bla(VEB-1), bla(NDM(-)), and bla(IMP-1)-like genes were found in 58.3{\%}, 41.7{\%}, 10.4{\%}, 4.2{\%}, and 2.1{\%}, respectively. GIM-, SPM-, SIM-, and OXA-2-like genes were not detected in this study. OXA-10-like gene was concomitant with VIM-2 and/or VEB. Twelve isolates harbored both OXA-10 and VIM-2; two isolates carried both OXA-10 and VEB. Only one strain contained OXA-10, VIM-2, and VEB. In conclusion, bla(VIM-2)- and bla(OXA-10)-like genes were the most prevalent genes in P. aeruginosa in Egypt.

23524,YES,Zhou2015a,Article,"Extended-spectrum -lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae have emerged as one of the major nosocomial pathogens. Between July and September 2012, a CTX-M-15 producing K. pneumoniae caused an outbreak in a university hospital in the Netherlands. The outbreak isolates were characterized and assigned to a novel sequence type (ST1427). An epidemiological link between affected patients was supported by patient contact tracing and whole-genome phylogenetic analysis. Intra-strain polymorphism was detected among multiple isolates obtained from different body sites of the index patient, which may relate to antibiotic treatment and/or host adaptation. Environmental contamination caused by the outbreak clone was found in the patient rooms even on medical equipment. The novel clone was not closely related to any known endemic/epidemic clone, but carried a set of a plasmid-borne resistance genes [blaCTX-M-15, blaTEM-1, blaOXA-1, aac(6')-Ib-cr, qnrB1, tetA(A), aac(3)-II]. Analysis of its virulence factors revealed a previously uncharacterized capsular biosynthesis region and two uncharacterized fimbriae gene clusters, and suggested that the new clone was not hypervirulent. To our knowledge, this is the first outbreak report of K. pneumoniae ST1427, and our study could be of help to understand the features of this newly emerging clone.",K Zhou and M Lokate and R H Deurenberg and J Arends and J L T Foe and H Grundmann and J W A Rossen and A W Friedrich,1664-302X,Frontiers in Microbiology,"Klebsiella pneumoniae infection,amoxicillin,amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid,antibiotic sensitivity,antibiotic therapy,article,bacterial growth,bacterial secretion system,cefepime,cefotaxime,cefoxitin,ceftazidime,cefuroxime,ciprofloxacin,cotrimoxazole,disease surveillance,drug resistance,erythromycin,extended spectrum beta lactamase,gene cluster,gene sequence,gentamicin,hospital infection,human,imipenem,meropenem,multidrug resistance,multilocus sequence typing,nitrogen utilization,norfloxacin,novobiocin,nucleotide sequence,pathogenicity,phylogeny,pollution,polymyxin B,single nucleotide polymorphism,spectrophotometry,tetracycline derivative,tobramycin,trimethoprim,virulence factor",NA,{Characterization of a CTX-M-15 producing Klebsiella pneumoniae outbreak strain assigned to a novel sequence type (1427)},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L607199064 http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2015.01250 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=1664302X{\&}id=doi:10.3389{\%}2Ffmicb.2015.01250{\&}atitle=Characterization,6,2015,NOV,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,MAYBE,Brooke,YES,Erica,Erica,Zach,yes,,

23766,MAYBE,NA:93,Article,"Meningoccocal disease causes substantial morbidity and mortality; approximately 10{\%} of cases are fatal. Among those who survive, 10{\%}-15{\%} have long-term sequelae. Nasopharyngeal carriage of Neisseria meningitidis is a precursor to disease; however, the majority of carriers do not develop disease. Household and other close contacts of persons with meningococcal disease have a higher risk for carriage and therefore invasive disease. These persons should receive antibiotic chemoprophylaxis to eliminate nasopharyngeal carriage of N. meningitidis as soon as possible. The rate of secondary disease for close contacts is highest immediately after onset of disease in the index patient; secondary cases rarely occur after 14 days. Ciprofloxacin, a second-generation fluoroquinolone, is an effective single-dose oral chemoprophylaxis agent. Although isolated cases of ciprofloxacin-resistant meningoccocal disease have been described in Argentina, Australia, China, France, India, and Spain, resistance has not been reported in North America. This report describes a cluster of three cases of fluoroquinolone-resistant meningococcal disease that occurred among residents of the border area of North Dakota and Minnesota during January 2007-January 2008. The first of these cases was epidemiologically linked and had closely related molecular features to a 2006 case of fluoroquinolone-susceptible meningococcal disease that occurred in the same geographic region. Until further notice, ciprofloxacin should not be used for chemoprophylaxis of close contacts of persons with meningococcal disease in selected counties in North Dakota and Minnesota.
