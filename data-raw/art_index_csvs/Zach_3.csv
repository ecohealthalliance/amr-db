There is almost no data regarding methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) prevalence in both countries. This study was conducted to investigate the prevalence and molecular epidemiology of S. aureus and MRSA nasal carriage among outpatients attending primary health care centers in two big cities in both countries. A total of 206 nasal swabs were obtained, 103 swabs from each country. S. aureus isolates were characterized by antibiotic susceptibility, presence of mecA and PVL genes, SCCmec-typing and spa typing, the corresponding Multi locus sequence typing clonal complex was assigned for each spa type based on Ridom StaphType database. MRSA was detected in 32{\%} of the Egyptian outpatients while it was found in 25{\%} of the Saudi Arabian outpatients. All MRSA isolates belonged to SCCmec type V and IVa, where some isolates in Saudi Arabia remained nontypeable. Surprisingly PVL(+) isolates were low in frequency: 15{\%} of MRSA Egyptian isolates and 12{\%} of MRSA isolates in Saudi Arabia. Two novel spa types were detected t11839 in Egypt, and t11841 in Saudi Arabia. We found 8 spa types among 20 isolates from Egypt, and 12 spa types out of 15 isolates from Saudi Arabia. Only two spa types t008 and t223 coexisted in both countries. Four clonal complexes (CC5, CC8, CC22, and CC80) were identified in both Egypt and Saudi Arabia. However, the data collected lacked a representation of isolates from different parts of each country as only one health center from each country was included, it still partially illustrates the CA-MRSA situation in both countries.

In recent years, multidrug-resistant pathogens, especially vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), have emerged rapidly worldwide and linezolid exhibited good clinical efficacy against VRE. However, linezolid-resistant bacteria have been reported from Turkey. In April 2011, a 66-year-old paraplegic woman was admitted to our hospital because of an infected decubitis ulcer and empirical antibiotic therapy was started. Since the patient's condition worsened during treatment, she was moved to the intensive care unit. Klebsiella pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium were recovered from tracheal aspirates and blood, respectively. Following three weeks of linezolid therapy blood culture yielded linezolid and vancomycin resistant E.faecium. Linezolid resistance in the VRE strain was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction and sequence analysis, subsequently. Linezolid-resistant two isolates were identified as E.faecium by 16S rRNA sequencing and both isolates had C2576U mutation in 23S rRNA gene. Linezolid resistance which was identified in a vancomycin-resistant E.faecium isolate is a new problem for Turkey. Last year another mutation related to linezolid resistance was reported from Istanbul, Turkey. The isolate had G2576T mutated 23S rRNA genes.

Isolation and characterisation of the different strains as well as the new emerging species and sub-species of these bacteria helps us to develop new antibiotic agents and the modification of the ones in use in order to cure both the human and the livestock animals from the infection with these microorganisms. During our study 80 different strains of Salmonella bacterium were isolated with later characterisation from a group 80 patients consisted of 44 male and 36 female individuals from Sulaimaniya, Erbil and Duhok governorates. Characterisation of the strains were accomplished be applying the E-test, disc diffusion test and the multiplex PCR with five different primer pairs for the identification of genes responsible of the O-antigene or the H-antigene respectively. 94.6{\%} of the individuals were bearing the O-antigene, 5.4{\%} were bearing the H-antigen. All the isolated strains were resistant against different antibiotics but all of them were resistant against chloramphenicol and gentamicin and seven different local strains were characterized.

296,MAYBE,Aia2016,Article,"Background Reliable estimates of the burden of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) are crucial for effective control and prevention of tuberculosis (TB). Papua New Guinea (PNG) is a high TB burden country with limited information on the magnitude of the MDR-TB problem. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in four PNG provinces: Madang, Morobe, National Capital District and Western Province. Patient sputum samples were tested for rifampicin resistance by the Xpert MTB/RIF assay and those showing the presence of resistance underwent phenotypic susceptibility testing to first- and second-line anti-TB drugs including streptomycin, isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, ofloxacin, amikacin, kanamycin and capreomycin. Results Among 1,182 TB patients enrolled in the study, MDR-TB was detected in 20 new (2.7{\%}; 95{\%} confidence intervals [CI] 1.1-4.3{\%}) and 24 previously treated (19.1{\%}; 95{\%}CI: 8.5-29.8{\%}) TB cases. No case of extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) was detected. Thirty percent (6/20) of new and 33.3{\%} (8/24) of previously treated cases with MDR-TB were detected in a single cluster in Western Province. Conclusion In PNG the proportion of MDR-TB in new cases is slightly lower than the regional average of 4.4{\%} (95{\%}CI: 2.6-6.3{\%}). A large proportion of MDR-TB cases were identified from a single hospital in Western Province, suggesting that the prevalence of MDR-TB across the country is heterogeneous. Future surveys should further explore this finding. The survey also helped strengthening the use of smear microscopy and Xpert MTB/RIF testing as diagnostic tools for TB in the country.This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

Evidence of emergence and spread of this marker are lacking in Nigeria. This study investigated bla{\textless}inf{\textgreater}CTX-M-I{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} ESBL production amongSalmonella isolates from hospitalized patients. Methods: Patients (158 total) made up of two groups were evaluated. Group A was composed of 135 patients with persistent pyrexia and group B was composed of 23 gastroenteritis patients and their stool samples. Samples were cultured, and isolates were identified and were subjected to antibiotic susceptibility testing by standard methods. Isolates were further screened for ESBL production, bla{\textless}inf{\textgreater}CTX-M-I{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} genes and transferability by double disk synergy test, plasmid extraction, polymerase chain reaction, and conjugation experiment. Results: Thirty-five (25.9{\%}) Salmonella isolates were identified from group A, of which 74.3{\%} wereS. typhi, 22.9{\%} were S. paratyphi and two (5.7{\%}) were invasive non-typhoidal S. enteritidis. NinePlasmodium falciparum infections were recorded, four of which were identified as co-infections with typhoidal Salmonella. Only two (8.7{\%}) S. enteritidis samples were obtained from group B (P{\textgreater}0.05). A total of 24 isolates were ESBL-positive, eliciting resistance to five to seven antibiotics, and were multiple-drug resistant. ESBL production due to the bla{\textless}inf{\textgreater}CTX-M-I{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} gene cluster was detected in eleven (45.8{\%}) Salmonella isolates. Nine (81.8{\%}) of the eleven bla{\textless}inf{\textgreater}CTX-M-I{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} ESBL producers were S. typhi and two (18.2{\%}) isolates were S. enteritidis. Four of nine S. typhi bla{\textless}inf{\textgreater}CTX-M-I{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} ESBL-producing strains harbored 23 kb self-transmissible plasmid that was co-transferred with cefotaxime and augmentin resistance to Escherichia coli j53-2 transconjugants. Conclusion: This study revealed the emergence of bla{\textless}inf{\textgreater}CTX-M-I{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} S. typhi as an agent of persistent pyrexia with potential to spread to other Enterobacteriaceae in Lagos, Nigeria.

Of the 188 strains tested, 3 isolates displayed reduced susceptibility to metronidazole after 48 h of incubation, while 27 additional isolates exhibited heterogeneous resistance after prolonged incubation; all 30 of the isolates were nim negative. Among the remaining 158 isolates, 7 nim-positive isolates were detected. All of these strains were identified as Prevotella baroniae by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and contained a new nim gene, named nimI, as determined by DNA sequence analysis. Chromosomal localization of this single-copy gene was demonstrated in all clinical isolates as well as in type strain P. baroniae DSM 16972 by using Southern hybridization. No known associated insertion sequence elements were detected upstream of the nimI gene in any of the nim-positive strains by PCR mapping. After prolonged exposure to metronidazole, stable resistant subpopulations could be selected in nimI-positive Prevotella isolates (n = 6) as well as in nim-negative Prevotella isolates (n = 6), irrespective of their initial susceptibility to this antibiotic. This study is the first description of a new nitroimidazole resistance gene in P. baroniae which seems to be silent and which might be intrinsic in this species.

A whole cell protein profile (as an alternative for serogrouping), in vitro toxin production and susceptibility to vancomycin, metronidazole and clindamycin were also investigated. All strains were typeable by both phenotypic and genotypic methods, and a total of 13 different PCR ribotypes were identified, of which seven (132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 142 and 143) were considered new types and accounted for 78.5{\%} of all samples evaluated (including hospital environments). A non-toxigenic C. difficile PCR ribotype 133 was detected in all children groups examined (inpatients, outpatients and healthy children), whilst toxigenic PCR ribotypes 015, 131, 134 and 135 were associated mostly with symptomatic children. Serogroups G and D were disseminated both in patients from the community and from the pediatric hospital, with group G prevalent among outpatient children.

474,YES,Aldape2013,Article,"Hypervirulent BI/NAP1/027 strains of Clostridium difficile have been associated with increased mortality of C. difficile infection (CDI). The emergence of highly fluoroquinolone (FLQ)-resistant BI/NAP1/027 strains suggests that FLQ exposure may be a risk factor for CDI development. However, the mechanism for this is not clear. We compared the effects of subinhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin on Toxin A and B gene expression and protein production in recent (strain 039) and historical (strain 5325) BI/NAP1/027 clinical isolates with high- and low-level ciprofloxacin resistance, respectively. In the highly ciprofloxacin-resistant isolate (strain 039), ciprofloxacin significantly and dose-dependently increased Toxin A gene expression and shifted its expression to earlier in its growth cycle; TcdB gene expression also increased but was less sensitive to low-dose ciprofloxacin. Maximal Toxin A/B production (4 ng ml -1) was increased twofold and occurred significantly earlier than in the untreated control. In strain 5325, ciprofloxacin at 0.25XMIC markedly increased both tcdA and tcdB expression but their temporal dynamics were unchanged. Maximal toxin production (250 ng ml -1) was reduced approximately threefold compared with that of the untreated control. These results demonstrate significant differences in ciprofloxacin-induced toxin gene expression and protein production among BI/ NAP1/027 isolates, and offer a new paradigm for FLQ-associated CDI caused by recent, highly antibiotic-resistant strains. {\textcopyright} 2013 SGM.",M J Aldape and A E Packham and D W Nute and A E Bryant and D L Stevens,0022-2615,Journal of Medical Microbiology,"Peptoclostridium difficile,RNA 16S,RNA isolation,agar gel electrophoresis,antibiotic resistance,article,bacterial RNA,bacterial genetics,bacterial growth,bacterial strain,bacterial toxin,bacterium isolate,ciprofloxacin,concentration response,controlled study,critically ill patient,exotoxin,gene expression,growth curve,human,minimum inhibitory concentration,nonhuman,nucleosome assembly protein 1,priority journal,real time polymerase chain reaction,toxin production,toxin synthesis",741--747,{Effects of ciprofloxacin on the expression and production of exotoxins by Clostridium difficile},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L368791959 http://dx.doi.org/10.1099/jmm.0.056218-0 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=00222615{\&}id=doi:10.1099{\%}2Fjmm.0.056218-0{\&}atitle=Effects+of+ciproflox,62,2013,PART5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,YES,Brooke,YES,Nchedo,Nchedo,Zach_3,yes,,

AIM: We report an outbreak of PVL-MRSA in a regional neonatal unit in the UK involving three babies and three staff members. METHODS: Quinolone susceptibility was helpful in identifying potential PVL-MRSA but toxin gene profiling and sequence-based typing were required to distinguish between two PVL-MRSA strains present in the unit. FINDINGS: All three symptomatic babies and two staff carriers, one of whom was symptomatic, were found to be carrying the South West Pacific (SWP) clone of PVL-MRSA (ST30). One of the staff carriers had recently visited the Philippines and was thought to be the source of the outbreak. Control was established using standard infection control procedures but one baby with relapsing MRSA colonization has required more than 100 days in isolation.

714,MAYBE,Amesur2014,Article,"LEARNING OBJECTIVE 1: Recognize the emergence of invasive Klebsiella pneumoniae in non-Asian populations in the United States LEARNING OBJECTIVE 2: Diagnose and treat invasive Klebsiella pneumoniae in a timely fashion for better patient outcomes CASE: We present a case series of 10 patients with invasive community acquired Klebsiella pneumoniae infections at a county hospital from 2010 to 2013. The data for this study was collected retrospectively. Charts were reviewed for the patients' hospitalizations. Data collected included age, gender, race, recent travel, country of origin, type of infection, and evidence of dissemination. We gathered information about medical conditions and co-morbidities that may be risk factors for invasive infection, including diabetes mellitus, cancer, steroid use, recent chemotherapy, recent radiation therapy, lung disease, liver disease, alcohol use, kidney disease, and central line or catheter use. In our results, the age range of patients was between 24 and 75 years of age, with a median age of 51. Most of the patients were male (7). The ethnicities of the patients were five Latino, two Caucasian, two Asian, and one African-American. Four were born in the United States (2 Caucasian, 1 Latino, 1 African-American). Four were born in Mexico (all were Latino), and the remainder two patients were born in Asia (Laotian and Cambodian). One had travel history within the past 10 years to South East Asia, and another patient had travel history within the past 2 years to Mexico. The types of infections most commonly seen were liver abscesses (5), followed by soft tissue infections (3), pelvic abscess (1), and pyelonephritis (1). Of the soft tissue infections, one patient had Fournier gangrene, one had neck abscess, and one had necrotizing fasciitis. Seven of the patients showed evidence of disseminated disease including bacteremia (4), urinary tract infection (4), and lung involvement (2). Most patients were septic on presentation and seven patients had elevated liver enzymes. The most common risk factors associated with invasive K. pneumoniae infections were diabetes (40 {\%}), followed by renal failure (30 {\%}) and history of cancer (20 {\%}). All 10 of our patients survived after treatment with appropriate antibiotics. DISCUSSION: Klebsiella pneumoniae, a member of the Enterobacteriaceae family, is a common human bacterial pathogen that can cause urinary tract infections, pneumonias, bacteremia, and intra-abdominal infections. It is recognized as a highly pathogenic organism that causes disease in the community and nosocomial settings. Invasive K. pneumoniae was first described in the early 1980's in Taiwan as the cause of pyogenic liver abscess. Since then, its emergence is most notable in Asian countries causing not only liver abscess but also pneumonia, urinary tract infection, brain abscess, endophthalmitis, pyogenic meningitis, empyema, septic pulmonary emboli, and osteomyelitis. Over the last decade, there is an increasing rise of this syndrome in the United States, emphasizing the importance of early recognition, diagnosis, and treatment. Most of these invasive infections are caused by the hypermucoviscous serotypes K1 and K2 and genotypes magA and rmpA. Hypermucoviscosity increases the virulence of K. pneumoniae, making it resistant to phagocytosis. The phenotype is identified in the laboratory using the “string test.” Patients with liver abscesses typically present with fever, chills, and abdominal pain. However, patients with invasive K. pneumoniae may present with leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, abnormal liver function tests, and increased glucose in the blood. Diabetes mellitus appears to be the most prevalent risk factor at 29 {\%}. Hospital mortality rate has been reported between 9 and 11 {\%}. Antibiotics are given based on culture and sensitivity results, although ceftriaxone has proven effective in most liver abscesses. While invasive K. pneumoniae infections are common and well reported in Asia, they are rare in the United States. There are few case reports published and only one sm ll case series described in California which reports infections affecting mostly patients of Asian descent. Previous cases in the United States occurred in primarily patients of Asian descent while our case series displayed a higher occurrence in Latino patients, which may indicate a different predisposition than previously reported for invasive infections in the United States. The emergence of K. pneumoniae in the United States, and most significantly in the Latino population, emphasizes the importance of recognizing invasive K. pneumoniae as the cause of liver abscesses, soft tissues infections, and other invasive diseases in non-Asian populations.",L S Amesur and D I Kim and J Persichino and M Sutjita and A Eskandari and V Jahangiri,0884-8734,Journal of General Internal Medicine,"African American,Asia,Asian,Cambodian,Caucasian,Enterobacteriaceae,Fournier gangrene,Hispanic,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Klebsiella pneumoniae infection,Mexico,Taiwan,United States,abdominal infection,abdominal pain,abscess,alcohol consumption,alcohol liver disease,antibiotic agent,bacteremia,bacterial meningitis,blood,brain abscess,case report,case study,catheter,ceftriaxone,central venous catheter,chemotherapy,community,diabetes mellitus,diagnosis,disease predisposition,diseases,empyema,endophthalmitis,ethnicity,fever,gender,genotype,glucose,hospitalization,human,hypertransaminasemia,infection,internal medicine,kidney disease,kidney failure,laboratory,leukocytosis,liver abscess,liver function test,lung,lung disease,lung embolism,male,morbidity,mortality,neck,necrotizing fasciitis,neoplasm,organisms,osteomyelitis,pathogenesis,patient,pelvis abscess,phagocytosis,phenotype,pneumonia,population,public hospital,pyelonephritis,pyogenic liver abscess,radiotherapy,risk factor,society,soft tissue,soft tissue infection,steroid,thrombocytopenia,travel,urinary tract infection,virulence",S271,{A case series of an emerging infection in the United States: Invasive klebsiella pneumoniae},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L71495305 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=08848734{\&}id=doi:{\&}atitle=A+case+series+of+an+emerging+infection+in+the+United+States{\%}3A+Invasive+klebsiella+pne,29,2014,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,YES,Allison,NO,Erica,Mushtaq,Zach_3,no,could not find full-text,
737,MAYBE,Amoureux2013,Article,"BACKGROUND: Achromobacter xylosoxidans is an emerging pathogen in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients recognised as causal agent of inflammation. The prevalence of infection or colonisation is variable among CF centres. We report here the first epidemiological data about A. xylosoxidans in a French CF centre: Dijon, Burgundy. METHODS: All isolates recovered from the patients affiliated with our centre in 2010 since their first visit were included. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by disk diffusion method and E-test. Molecular epidemiology was performed by Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) and compared with repetitive sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR, DiversiLab(R)). We also sequenced the constitutive bla-oxa-114 gene. RESULTS: Out of 120 patients, 21 (17.5{\%}) had at least one positive culture with A. xylosoxidans since they started to receive routine care in our CF centre (447 isolates). Median age at first positive culture was 16 years (range 3-34 years). Most patients were colonised by their own strain, cross-contamination was very rare. We observed two cases of intra-family spread. DiversiLab(R) is a useful tool as efficient as PFGE to compare isolates recovered simultaneously from different patients when an outbreak is suspected. However, PFGE remains the reference method for long-term survey of chronically colonised patients. We detected new OXA-114 variants and the new oxacillinase OXA-243 (88{\%} amino acid identity with OXA-114). Acquired resistance to ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime and carbapenems was frequent. In 2010, 7 patients harboured strains resistant to ceftazidime, 6 patients strains with decreased susceptibility to carbapenems (especially meropenem) and 12 patients strains resistant to ciprofloxacin. CONCLUSIONS: In our centre, the high prevalence of colonisation is not due to cross-contamination.

It rarely causes spontaneous disease, but its incidence is increased in immunocompromised patients, and it has previously been described in peritoneal dialysis and transplant patients. Case Report: A 78-year-old gentleman presented with nephrotic syndrome (proteinuria 18 g/day, serum alb 18 g/L) and associated acute kidney injury, requiring dialysis. Background history included hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Kidney biopsy revealed minimal change disease (MCD), as well as acute tubular necrosis. He was commenced on oral prednisone (75 mg/day), and weaned off dialysis. Initial treatment was complicated by steroid-induced delirium, necessitating a reduction in prednisolone to 50 mg/day with some effect. Six weeks after diagnosis, the patient was noted to have developed blistering skin lesions on his distal right upper limb that were migrating proximally, and not responsive to standard antibiotic therapy. Specialist infectious diseases advice was sought, with skin swabs positive for M. chelonae (doxycycline-resistant). Steroid dose was halved, and the patient was commenced on combination antibiotic therapy, clarithromycin and linezolid, for 9 months, with slow resolution of the lesions. Prednisolone was held at 25 mg/day for the next 2 months, and then tapered. The patient's renal function stabilised at ∼60 mL/min after an unexplained drop to 30 mL/min, with an ongoing decline in proteinuria, despite sub-optimal steroid dosing. The patient now remains free of new skin lesions post completion of anti-tuberculous therapy, with continued reduction in proteinuria, and stable renal function.

1021,MAYBE,Arredondo-Garcia2007,Article,"Abstract. Background: Growing antibiotic resistance demands the constant reassessment of antimicrobial efficacy, particularly in countries with wide antibiotic abuse, where higher resistance prevalence is often found. Knowledge of resistance trends is particularly important when prescribing antibiotics empirically, as is usually the case for urinary tract infections (UTIs). Currently, in Mexico City, ampicillin, cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole), and ciprofloxacin are used as {""}first-line{""} antibiotic treatment for UTI. Objective: The aim of this study was to analyze the resistance of bacterial isolates to antibiotics, with a focus on first-line antibiotics, in Mexican pediatric patients and sexually active or pregnant female outpatients. Methods: In this multicenter susceptibility analysis, bacterial isolates from urine samples collected from pediatric patients and sexually-active or pregnant female outpatients presenting with acute, uncomplicated UTIs in Mexico City from January 2006 through June 2006, were included in the study. Samples were tested for susceptibility to 10 antibiotics by the disk-diffusion method. Results: Four-hundred and seventeen bacterial isolates were derived from sexually active or pregnant female outpatients (324 Escherichia coli) and pediatric patients (93 Klebsiella pneumoniae). We found a high prevalence of resistance towards the drugs used as {""}first-line{""} when treating UTIs: ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, and ciprofloxacin (79{\%}, 60{\%}, and 24{\%} resistance, respectively). Ninety-eight percent of K pneumoniae isolates were resistant to ampicillin, whereas 66{\%} of the E coli isolates were resistant to cotrimoxazole. Resistance towards third-generation cephalosporins was also high (6{\%}-8{\%} of E coli and 10{\%}-28{\%} of K pneumoniae). This was possibly caused by chromosomal $\beta$-lactamases, as 30{\%} of all isolates were also resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanate. In contrast, 98{\%} of the E coli isolates and 84{\%} of the K pneumoniae strains (96{\%} of all isolates) were found to be susceptible to nitrofurantoin, which has been in clinical use for much longer than most other drugs in this study. Conclusion: In these urine samples from laboratories in Mexico City, resistance of K pneumoniae and E coli isolates to first-line treatment (ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, or ciprofloxacin) of UTI was high, whereas most E coli and K pneumoniae isolates were susceptible to nitrofurantoin and the fourth-generation cephalosporin cefepime.

1406,MAYBE,Balkhy2011,Article,"Introduction / objectives: We describe our experience in detecting and containing the first documented CRKP outbreak in Saudi Arabia (SA). Methods: A prospective investigation of all cases identified with carbapenem resistance during the outbreak peroid and six months prior. Results: During March 2010, a cluster of 6 patients with CRKP was detected. Patients with CRKP were placed under strict contact isolation. Admission and periodic active surveillance cultures showed a downward trend of CRKP clinical cases over the following months to zeros in July and August. All patients had prolonged hospital stay before CRKP detection and the majority had recent history of carbapenem use (75{\%}), colonization/infection with other MDROs (75{\%}), surgical procedures (80{\%}), indwelling devices (83{\%}), and mechanical ventilation (75{\%}). About 33{\%} of patients with CRKP had clinical infection and 58{\%} died during the current hospitalization. PFGE results identified a dominant clone during the outbreak, Figure 1.

The aim of the study was to find out the changes in uropathogen's antimicrobial susceptibility of patients admitted in 1996 and 2009. Material {\&} Methods: We have retrospectively analyzed 302 first urine cultures with significant bacteriuria in 282 patients hospitalized at the urology department in 1996 and 2009. The antimicrobial susceptibility was estimated according to the NCCLS protocol. Results: The study is focused on the most frequent uropatogen E.coli with prevalence of 71,2{\%} in 2009. Nitrofurantoin had very low rates of resistance in 1996 and 2009 as well (7,7{\%} and 5,1{\%} respectively). We have noticed double as high resistance to chinolons in 2009 than in 1996. Resistance to trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole decreased, but remains still high in the level of 25,8{\%}. Cefuroxim shows high antimicrobial activity with resistance of 10,1{\%} in 2009. Conclusions: Increased use of some types of antibiotics, like chinolons, can result in higher resistance.

1917,MAYBE,Berebichez-Fridman2016,Article,"Introduction: . Chromobacterium violaceum is a Gram-negative, facultative, anaerobic, non-sporing, fermentative and oxidase-positive coccobacillus. Human infections caused by . Chromobacterium violaceum are infrequent. There are a few reported cases in several countries. Those infections appear after a skin contact with soil or contaminated water. Infections can progress to necrotizing metastatatic lesions and multiple abscesses of the lung, liver, skin, spleen, lymph nodes and brain with fatal septicemia. Infections caused by this bacterium have a high lethality rate, with a low recovery rate among survivors. It has been described that this bacterium is resistant to several antibiotics. Materials and methods: . Chromobacterium violaceum was isolated, cultivated, and identified from oysters from thirteen different restaurants in Mexico City and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed. Results: Four isolations of . Chromobacterium violaceum were obtained from oysters. Three of them corresponded to biotype 36 and all of them had a confidence factor of 0.987. All isolations were resistant to Carbencillin, Cephalothin and Cephotaxime. Two isolations were also resistant to Ampicillin and one was resistant to Amikacin. All isolations were sensitive to Ceftriaxone, Chloramphenicol, Gentamicin, Netilmicin, Nitrofurantoin, Pefloxacine and Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole. Conclusions: The presence of . Chromabacterium violaceum in food obtained from salt marshes that usually are eaten fresh (like oysters) means a high potential risk for human health because this bacterium has been associated with high morbidity and mortality. In our report, this bacterium showed resistance to several antibacterial agents. Patients should be cautions when eating fresh seafood, and healthcare personnel should suspect an infection caused by . Chromobacterium violaceum if the patient presents with sepsis, enteritis or abscesses and they have risk factors for acquiring this bacterium in order to provide prompt treatment and reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with the infection.

Methods: The authors conducted a cross-sectional nasopharyngeal swab survey of 151 children affected with HIV presenting for routine outpatient care in West Bengal, India. Results: 151 HIV affected children were enrolled. The median age was 6, 148/151 children were HIV positive, 65{\%} had moderate to severe malnutrition, 53{\%} were moderately to severely immunosuppressed, 17{\%} were on antiretroviral therapy (ART), 90{\%} were on cotrimoxazole prophylaxis (TMP/SMX). None had received the pneumococcal or Hib conjugate vaccines. Hib prevalence was 13{\%} and pneumococcal prevalence was 28{\%}. Children with normal or moderate immune suppression had high rates of colonization compared to those with severe immunosuppression (71{\%} Hib, 61{\%} pneumococcus). Hib and pneumococcal isolates had high rates of resistance to tested antibiotics including TMP/SMX and third generation cephalosporins. Neither ART nor TMP/SMX prevented colonization. Children colonized with multidrug resistant isolates had high rates of exposure to TMP/SMX. Conclusions: HIV infection, late access to ART, high rates of colonization to resistant organisms and lack of access to vaccines makes this population vulnerable to invasive disease from Hib and pneumococcus. {\textcopyright} 2010 Dr. K C Chaudhuri Foundation.",S D Bhattacharya and S K Niyogi and S Bhattacharyya and S Fitzwater and N Chauhan and A Sudar and S Mandal,0019-5456,Indian Journal of Pediatrics,"Haemophilus influenzae type b,Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine,Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient,Human immunodeficiency virus infection,India,Pneumococcus vaccine,Streptococcus pneumoniae,ampicillin,antibiotic agent,antibiotic prophylaxis,antibiotic resistance,antibiotic sensitivity,antiretrovirus agent,article,azithromycin,bacterial colonization,bacterium carrier,bacterium identification,bacterium isolate,cefixime,cefoperazone,cefotaxime,cefoxitin,ceftriaxone,cefuroxime,cephalosporin derivative,child,chloramphenicol,cohort analysis,controlled study,cotrimoxazole,cross-sectional study,drug exposure,erythromycin,female,health care access,human,immune deficiency,immunization,infant,major clinical study,male,malnutrition,multidrug resistance,nasopharynx,newborn,nonhuman,outpatient care,oxacillin,preschool child,rifampicin,risk factor,school child,tetracycline,throat culture,tuberculosis,tuberculostatic agent,vulnerable population",423--429,{High rates of colonization with drug resistant hemophilus influenzae type B and Streptococccus Pneumoniae in unvaccinated HIV infected children from West Bengal},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L51196750 http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12098-010-0310-z http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=00195456{\&}id=doi:10.1007{\%}2Fs12098-010-0310-z{\&}atitle=High+rates+of+c,78,2011,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,MAYBE,Cale,MAYBE,Ayomide,Ayomide,Zach_3,yes,,

Methods: A CRE outbreak investigation was conducted in a 77- bed LTACH from Dec. 2010 through Aug. 2012. Retrospective chart review of 30 patients with CRE was conducted to identify the source and modes of transmission, analyze the incidence pattern, and determine treatment outcomes. Culture sensitivity analyses were also conducted to evaluate resistance patterns among isolates. Results: Of the 30 patients with CRE, 24 (80{\%}) were infected and 6 (20{\%}) were colonized with KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumonia (KPC-Kp). The mean age of patients was 70 ±11.5 years, 19 patients (63{\%}) were female, and 25 patients (83{\%}) were African-American. Among the 18 patients (60{\%}) who received treatment, 15 patients received monotherapy and 3 received combination therapy. Negative cultures were obtained for 4 patients (22{\%}) within two weeks of the first positive culture result, while treatment failure was observed for the remaining 14 (78{\%}) receiving treatment. Culture sensitivity analyses indicated that all isolates shared a common multi-drug resistant phenotype, with resistance to amoxicillin/ clavulanate, ticarcillin/clavulanate, piperacillin/tazobactam, tobramycin, carbapenems, 2nd-,3rd-, and 4th-generation cephalosporins, aztreonam, fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin), and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Additionally, of the 18 isolates with susceptibility data for colistin, 3 (17{\%}) were resistant, with MIC values of 1, 3, and 16 mg/L. Furthermore, of the 17 isolates with susceptibility data for tigecycline, 3 (18{\%}) were resistant, with MIC values of 4 mg/L. Conclusions: Both monotherapy and combination treatment regimens were largely ineffective in eradicating this infection, including regimens containing colistin and tigecycline.

This organism has most commonly been implicated in cutaneous infection in both healthy and immunosuppressed patients. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of septic shock in the setting of disseminated M. immunogenum infection. Definitive identification of this organism requires gene sequencing at specialized centers, which may limit its detection.

2444,MAYBE,Bose2014,Article,"Introduction: To study clarithromycin resistance patterns of H. pylori infections in an ambulatory setting utilizing PCR based assays as a guide for appropriate therapy. Methods: A total of 332 patients with suspected H. pylori infection from September 2013 to March 2014 were tested and followed in the ambulatory physician office setting. Stool and tissue specimens were collected and analyzed by PCR for antibiotic resistance patterns. Presence of H. pylori after antibiotic resistant guided therapy was re-evaluated in patients at follow-up visits. Results: The use of the new PCR based resistance testing showed 84/129 (65{\%}) were resistant to clarithromycin. In our group only 40 of the 84 who received the resistance guided therapy came for follow-up and retesting. Of the 40, 26 were negative for H. pylori showing a 65{\%} eradication rate in our study group despite utilizing non-clarithromycin based treatment regimens. Conclusion: Despite using only clarithromycin antibiotic resistance guide therapy we were able to achieve a modest 65{\%} eradication rate in our study group. The confounding variable that could have contributed to this could have been prior infection, cross resistances to other antibiotics used, recurrence, and reinfection. Incorporating resistance testing to other antibiotics and improving patient adherence in the community setting may infer a higher eradication rates in the future.

Currently KPC (class A), NDM (class B), and OXA-48 types (class D) are the most globally widespread carbapenemases. However, among the GES-type class A extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) there are variants that hydrolyze carbapenems, with blaGES-5 being the most common. Two Escherichia coli and two Serratia marcescens harboring blaGES-5 on plasmids were isolated by the Canadian Nosocomial Infection Surveillance Program (CNISP) from four different patients in a single hospital over a 2-year period. Complete sequencing of the blaGES-5 plasmids indicated that all four had nearly identical backbones consisting of genes for replication, partitioning, and stability, but contained variant accessory regions consisting of mobile elements and antimicrobial resistance genes. The plasmids were of a novel replicon type, but belonged to the MOBQ1 group based on relaxase sequences, and appeared to be mobilizable, but not self-transmissible. Considering the time periods of bacterial isolation, it would appear the blaGES-5 plasmid has persisted in an environmental niche for at least 2 years in the hospital.

It is unclear which populations are at high risk for the emergence of these strains. METHODS: All unique patient isolates of S. aureus were collected from hospitals in Brooklyn, NY over a three-month period. Isolates of MRSA that were susceptible to clindamycin underwent SCCmec typing. Isolates with the SCCmec type IV (characteristic of CA-MRSA strains) underwent ribotyping. Demographic information involving the neighborhoods of Brooklyn was also gathered and correlated with the prevalence of CA-MRSA strains. RESULTS: Of 1316 isolates collected during the surveillance, 217 were MRSA susceptible to clindamycin. A total of 125 isolates possessed SCCmec type IV; 72 belonged to the USA300 strain and five belonged to the USA400 strain. Hospitals in the eastern part of the city had the highest prevalence of USA300 strain. Individuals in the eastern region, when compared to the western region, were more likely to be Black, Hispanic, female, and {\textless} 18 years of age, and to have households of {\textgreater} or = 3 persons. In addition, the median household income was lower, and the proportion of individuals on public assistance was higher, for the population in the eastern region. CONCLUSION: The USA300 strain of CA-MRSA is emerging in New York City.

2951,MAYBE,Calfee2012a,Article,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterocci (VRE) are the two most common healthcare-associated multidrug-resistant organisms. The purpose of this article is to review recent data regarding the epidemiology, control and treatment of these organisms as well as to discuss the emergence of additional antimicrobial resistance determinants. RECENT FINDINGS: Although the prevalence of methicillin resistance continues to increase among healthcare-associated S. aureus isolates, the incidence of invasive MRSA infections appears to be decreasing. Reduced susceptibility to vancomycin among MRSA isolates has been associated with glycopeptide treatment failure. Resistance to newer antimicrobial agents, such as daptomycin and linezolid, has been described among isolates of MRSA and VRE, further complicating treatment of infections caused by these organisms. Recent studies that have attempted to assess the efficacy of a variety of strategies for the prevention of MRSA and/or VRE transmission and infection, including active surveillance testing, have been published and additional studies are currently underway. SUMMARY: MRSA and VRE remain important causes of morbidity and mortality among patients receiving healthcare. The emergence of resistance to additional antimicrobial agents highlights the importance of effective prevention programs. Further study to determine the optimal approaches to treatment and prevention is needed.",D P Calfee,0951-7375,Curr Opin Infect Dis,"*Vancomycin Resistance/physiology,Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use,Cost of Illness,Cross Infection/prevention {\&} control,Enterococcus/*drug effects,Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections/*epidemiology/p,Humans,Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus/*drug,Prevalence,Staphylococcal Infections/epidemiology/prevention",385--394,"{Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and other Gram-positives in healthcare}",NA,25,2012,4,"1473-6527

We report MRSA sepsis in a 16-year-old male from a small town and who had no history of exposure to healthcare or recent travel. After trauma during a soccer match, he presented swelling in the right thigh, which evolved in a month to cellulitis complicated by local abscess, orchitis and pneumonia. The patient presented severe sepsis, with fever and respiratory failure. Laboratory findings included blood leukocyte counts above 40,000/mm(3) and thrombocytopenia. He was submitted to mechanical ventilation and therapy with vancomycin and imipenem. He had a slow but favorable response to therapy and was discharged after six weeks of hospitalization. MRSA grew from blood cultures and respiratory aspirates obtained before antimicrobial therapy. The isolate belonged to sequence type 5, spa type t311, harbored SCCmec type IV and genes for Panton-Valentine leukocidin and Enterotoxin A. The pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pattern was distinct from North American classic CA-MRSA clones.

3034,YES,Caneiras2012,Article,"Objectives: Nowadays the carbapenems resistance among Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae are serious therapeutic and infection control challenge. The aim of this study was to analyse the clinical characteristics and to investigate the genetic basis of the carbapenem resistance of K. pneumoniae and A. baumannii clinical strains isolated from the same patient. Methods: Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by disk diffusion (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefotaxime, cefoxitine, ceftazidime, imipenem, meropenem, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, tigecycline and colistin), and interpreted according to CLSI guidelines. The presence of blaTEM, blaSHV, blaCTX, blaKPC, blaIMP and blaVIM was screened by PCR using specific primers. Amplicons were sequenced and compared to sequences available in the GeneBank database. Results: A female patient, with 35 years old, had renal insufficiency, being an immunocompromised host. She had been submitted to ciprofloxacin and meropenem therapy before the identification, in February 2011, of KPC-3 producing Klebsiella pneumoniae. Acinetobacter baumannii 86982FF was isolated in March 2011. Both isolates were recovered from sputum at surgical ward. K. pneumoniae showed susceptibility to colistin, intermediate susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin, and resistance to the other antimicrobials, including tigecycline. A. baumannii was resistant to all studied antimicrobials and was identified a KPC-3 carbapenemase. The blaKPC-3 gene was part of a plasmid in both isolates and was included in transposon Tn4401. Conclusions: We report for the first time the identification of multidrugresistant A. baumannii producing KPC-3 carbapenemase in Portugal. The report of KPC-3-producing A. baumannii isolates is very worrisome, since these strains are resistant to all beta-lactam agents and to other antimicrobials, including colistin and tigecycline.",C Caneiras and F Calisto and G {Da Silva} and T Amores and L Lito and J {Melo Cristino} and A Duarte,1198-743X,Clinical Microbiology and Infection,"Acinetobacter baumannii,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Portugal,acid,antibiotic sensitivity,antiinfective agent,beta lactam,carbapenem,carbapenem derivative,carbapenemase,cefotaxime,ceftazidime,ciprofloxacin,colistin,data base,disk diffusion,female,gene,gentamicin,human,imipenem,immunocompromised patient,infection,infection control,kidney failure,meropenem,microbiology,patient,plasmid,sputum,surgical ward,therapy,tigecycline,transposon",302,{First identification of colistin and tigecycline-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii producing KPC-3 carbapenemase in Portugal},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L70822935 http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-0691.2012.03802.x http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=1198743X{\&}id=doi:10.1111{\%}2Fj.1469-0691.2012.03802.x{\&}atitle=F,18,2012,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,YES,Cale,YES,Erica,Erica,Zach_3,no,could not get full-text access through Emory,
3100,MAYBE,Carbonne2010,Article,"An outbreak of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae type 2 was detected in September 2009 in two hospitals in a suburb south of Paris, France. In total, 13 KPC-producing K. pneumoniae type 2 cases (four with infections and nine with digestive-tract colonisations) were identified, including a source case transferred from a Greek hospital. Of the 13 cases, seven were secondary cases associated with use of a contaminated duodenoscope used to examine the source case (attack rate: 41{\%}) and five were secondary cases associated with patient-to-patient transmission in hospital. All isolated strains from the 13 patients: (i) exhibited resistance to all antibiotics except gentamicin and colistin, (ii) were more resistant to ertapenem (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) always greater than 4 mg/L) than to imipenem (MIC: 1-8 mg/L, depending on the isolate), (iii) carried the blaKPC-2 and blaSHV12 genes and (iv) had an indistinguishable pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern. These cases occurred in three hospitals: some were transferred to four other hospitals. Extended infection control measures implemented in the seven hospitals included: (i) limiting transfer of cases and contact patients to other wards, (ii) cohorting separately cases and contact patients, (iii) reinforcing hand hygiene and contact precautions and (iv) systematic screening of contact patients. Overall, 341 contact patients were screened. A year after the outbreak, no additional case has been identified in these seven hospitals.

3434,MAYBE,Chandwani2014,Article,"Rationale: Isolation of subpopulations of Staphylococcus aureus with the small-colony variant (SCV) phenotype has become essential among CF patients. S. aureus can persist in the airways of people with CF for years and can develop a hyper-mutator phenotype and may undergo adaptive changes, including SCVs, to survive within the unique environment of the CF airway Methods: Sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage and respiratory specimens received by the microbiology laboratories at New York University Langone Medical Center (NYULMC) were evaluated using cystic fibrosis (CF) work up protocol (CFWU). As of 10/15/2013 this protocol included identification of S. aureus presenting as tiny pinpoint colonies (as small as 1/10 the size of the predominant S. aureus morphotype) on Columbia colistin and nalidixic (CNA) agar. Comparative morphology on chocolate and mannitol salt agar plates was used for initial confirmation. Results: Microbiologic analysis of specimens from 98 cystic fibrosis patients during January 1, 2013 to May 7, 2014 period was performed by using CFWU protocol. During the 16 month period, 79 patients were cultured. Median age of CF patients was 17 years and 57{\%} were males. A total of 772 isolates were recovered, 36{\%} of these isolates were positive for Staphylococcus aureus (n=277). Using a cefoxitin screen and oxacillin susceptibility testing (Biomerieux Vitek 2; AST-GP67 {\&} GP75) 43{\%} of Staphylococcus aureus isolates were found methicillin resistant (n=158). Among initial isolates of Staphylococcus aureus high level resistance was noted for macrolide, clindamycin, levofloxacin and gentamicin (69{\%}, 57{\%}, 30{\%} and 12{\%}, respectively). The resistance for macrolide, clindamycin, levofloxacin, and gentamicin increased for subsequent isolates (71 {\%}, 68{\%}, 39{\%} and 13{\%}, respectively). Although 100{\%} of initial isolates were susceptible to vancomycin and linezolid, 6 subsequent isolates showed resistance to linezolid. Between October 15, 2013 to May 7, 2014, SCV culture testing was performed for 48 patients. None of the isolates yielded small colony variants. Conclusion: Prevalent Staphylococcus aureus strains at NYULMC CF center have acquired multiple drug resistance. Although increasing prevalence of MRSA and fluoroquinolone resistance is known, emergence of linezolid resistance is highly concerning.

Only a single previous case of pneumonia, pericarditis, and meningitis has been reported. Case Description: We recently encountered a patient with brain abscess from which S acidominimus was isolated after initially being recorded as S viridans. Because 49{\%} of all S viridans isolated from abscesses are resistant to $\beta$-lactam antimicrobials, speciation is important as well as in vitro sensitivity testing. Streptococcus acidominimus is ordinarily sensitive to $\beta$-lactams, and the use of ceftriaxone for 6 weeks successfully resulted in cure of the brain abscess. Conclusion: The use of speciation in treatment of S viridans should improve clinical outcomes. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

These four isolates were negative for the 23S rRNA mutations, but positive for the gene cfr. Mutations in the gene for the ribosomal protein L3, which resulted in the amino acid exchanges Gly152Asp and Tyr158Phe, were identified in S. haemolyticus 09D279 and S. cohnii NDM113, respectively. In each isolate, the cfr gene was located on a plasmid of ca. 35.4 kb, as shown by S1 nuclease pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and Southern blotting experiments. This plasmid was indistinguishable from the previously described plasmid pSS-02 by its size, restriction pattern, and a sequenced 14-kb cfr-carrying segment. Plasmid pSS-02 was originally identified in staphylococci isolated from pigs. This is the first time that a cfr-carrying plasmid has been detected in MRCoNS obtained from intensive care patients in China.

4489,MAYBE,Curiao2010,Article,"BACKGROUND: KPC carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates have been increasingly detected in Europe. We report the first KPC-producing isolates characterized in Madrid, Spain. METHODS: Twelve K. pneumoniae isolates recovered from clinical and surveillance cultures from eight patients (September 2009 to February 2010) that were resistant to carbapenems and resulted in a positive modified Hodge test, were screened for carbapenemase genes (PCR, sequencing and hybridization). Clonal relatedness was established by PFGE and multilocus sequence typing. Plasmid characterization included incompatibility group assay and XhoI/HindIII restriction pattern comparison. The genetic environment was characterized by PCR based on the Tn4401 sequence. RESULTS: All 12 isolates were resistant to all beta-lactams, including imipenem and meropenem (MIC {\textgreater}or= 8 mg/L). Eleven of them, fully susceptible to aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones, showed related PFGE patterns and belonged to sequence type (ST) 384 and harboured the bla(KPC-3), bla(OKP-5), bla(OXA-9) and bla(TEM-1) genes, whereas one isolate resistant to quinolones belonged to ST388, and also harboured the bla(CTX-M-10) gene. The bla(KPC-3), bla(OXA-9) and bla(TEM-1) genes were located on an approximately 85 kb non-transferable plasmid that was a derivative of pKPN3/pKPN4 previously described in K. pneumoniae. The bla(KPC-3) gene was located on the Tn4401 'isoform a' variant, which is usually linked to bla(KPC-2), but rarely to bla(KPC-3). CONCLUSIONS: The emergence of Tn4401-bla(KPC-3) within a pKPN3/4-like plasmid and its novel association with ST384 and ST388 K. pneumoniae clones in Spain is reported. Although bla(KPC-3) has been scarcely reported in Europe, the location of this Tn4401a in a widespread K. pneumoniae plasmid supports the possibility of broader future dissemination.",T Curiao and M I Morosini and P Ruiz-Garbajosa and A Robustillo and F Baquero and T M Coque and R Canton,0305-7453,J Antimicrob Chemother,"*DNA Transposable Elements,Adolescent,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology,Bacterial Proteins/*biosynthesis,Carbapenems/pharmacology,DNA, Bacterial/chemistry/genetics,Female,Humans,Klebsiella Infections/*microbiology,Klebsiella pneumoniae/classification/*drug effects,Male,Middle Aged,Nucleic Acid Hybridization,Plasmids/classification/*isolation {\&} purification,Polymerase Chain Reaction,Restriction Mapping,Sequence Analysis, DNA,Spain,beta-Lactam Resistance,beta-Lactamases/*biosynthesis,purification",1608--1614,{Emergence of bla KPC-3-Tn4401a associated with a pKPN3/4-like plasmid within ST384 and ST388 Klebsiella pneumoniae clones in Spain},NA,65,2010,8,"1460-2091

The recent Libyan crises have resulted in heavy war wound infection caused by highly-resistant pathogens that Libyan hospitals are not familiar with; among them MDR Acinetobacter baumannii. The objectives of this study were to determine (i) Epidemiological manifestations of A. baumannii among injured military personnel admitted to Tripoli Medical Centre (ii) Antimicrobial resistance patterns of this pathogen (iii) Phenotypes and molecular characteristics of such pathogen. Methods: A total of 498 patients with wounds classified as war wound associated infections (WWAI) showed positive bacterial cultures isolated from the swabs or the wound debridement were studied. Off these 144 culture showed A. baumannii according the standard microbiological identification methodsantimicrobial susceptibility tests were carried out using, ceftazidime, gentamicin, Amikacin, ciprofloxacillin and Imipenem. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis were carried to determine clonality. Results: A. baumannii infection were more likely to be associated with gunshot wounds (70{\%}), external fixators (55{\%}), Blast (30{\%}), blunt (20{\%}), fragmentation (15{\%}). Antibiotic resistance rates vary according to the antibiotic used, ceftazidime (90{\%}), gentamicin (95{\%}), amikacin (85{\%}), ciprofloxacillin (95{\%}) and Imipenem (45{\%}).

The mechanisms of resistance to VA and to other antibiotics as well as the presence of esp and hyl virulence genes were determined in these isolates by PCR, being their clonal relationship analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). VA resistance mechanisms detected were as follows (species-patient/environment): vanA (Enterococcus faecium, 13/5), vanC1 (Enterococcus gallinarum, 3/0), and vanC2 (Enterococcus casseliflavus, 0/7). Most of the VA-resistant enterococci presented a multiresistance phenotype and harbored different resistance genes (erm(B), tet(M), tet(L), ant(6)-Ia, aac(6')- aph(2{""}), aph(3')-IIIa, and catA). The PFGE revealed the presence of 3 clones (A, B, C) and 1 closely related pattern (A1) among the 13 vanA-containing E. faecium isolates of patients showing 11 of them the A-A1 patterns. The clone A was also detected in all 5 environmental vanA-containing E. faecium isolates. Strains did not contain esp or hyl virulence genes. Multilocus sequence typing was performed in 4 E. faecium isolates representative of the 4 detected pulsotypes (A, A1, B, and C), and 2 different sequence types were identified (ST18 and ST80), both of them included in clonal complex CC17. These strains contained the IS16 element and showed ampicillin and ciprofloxacin resistance.

5824,MAYBE,Eljammal2012,Article,"Background Bacterial meningitis caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) is rare, occurring primarily in patients who have undergone neurosurgical procedures, but it has also been described in the absence of intracranial instrumentation in leukemic bone marrow transplant (BMT) patients with central line-associated enterococcal blood stream infections. We report a fatal case of VRE meningitis in a solid organ transplant patient. Case A 42 year-old man with a past medical history of type 1 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease requiring kidney-pancreas transplantation in 2005 was admitted to the intensive care unit with fever, abdominal pain, and hypotension. He had resumed hemodialysis one year prior due to graft failure from medication non-compliance. He was found to be in diabetic ketoacidosis, for which he was placed on intravenous insulin drip at an outside hospital and then transferred to our institution. Laboratory studies showed renal failure, metabolic acidosis with increased anion gap, and elevated amylase and lipase. Computed tomography imaging of his abdomen showed an edematous pancreas transplant with areas of necrosis in his right pelvis. Blood and urine cultures grew VRE, for which he was started on linezolid. His necrotic pancreas was surgically debrided, and tissue cultures grew VRE. After appropriate source control and antibiotics, his sepsis resolved. Three days later, he developed new grand mal seizures, and CSF cultures grew VRE. Although his fever and leukocytosis improved, his neurologic status did not improve due to insults from his prior hypotensive episodes, prompting his family to withdraw care. Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the first case of a non-BMT, non-intracranial instrumented sepsis patient who developed VRE meningitis in a medical intensive care unit. Although hematologic seeding of the central nervous system with VRE is rare, it is possible in immunosuppressed patients. The difficulty in treating VRE meningitis involves both drug kinetics and microbial resistance factors. Although quinupristin/dalfopristin, daptomycin and teicoplanin have been used with mixed success, linezolid has been reported to be a useful option for treating VRE meningitis, achieving sufficient CSF concentrations.",S Eljammal and A Balekian,1073-449X,American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,"American,R factor,abdomen,abdominal pain,acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis,amylase,anion gap,antibiotic agent,antihypertensive agent,bacterial meningitis,blood,bloodstream infection,bone marrow transplantation,central nervous system,central venous catheter,cerebrospinal fluid,cerebrospinal fluid culture,computer assisted tomography,dalfopristin plus quinupristin,daptomycin,devices,diabetic ketoacidosis,drug therapy,end stage renal disease,fatality,fever,graft failure,hemodialysis,hospital,human,hypertension,hypotension,imaging,insulin,insulin dependent diabetes mellitus,intensive care unit,kidney failure,kidney pancreas transplantation,laboratory,leukocytosis,linezolid,male,medical history,meningitis,metabolic acidosis,necrosis,neurosurgery,pancreas,pancreas transplantation,patient,pelvis,pharmacokinetics,sepsis,society,solid,teicoplanin,tissue culture,tonic clonic seizure,transplantation,triacylglycerol lipase,urine culture,vancomycin resistant Enterococcus",NA,{A case of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus meningitis complicating necrotizing pancreatitis},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L71989233 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=1073449X{\&}id=doi:{\&}atitle=A+case+of+vancomycin-resistant+enterococcus+meningitis+complicating+necrotizing+pancre,185,2012,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,MAYBE,Cale,NO,Mushtaq,Ayomide,Zach_3,no,could not get full-text access through Emory,

Against clinical isolates of Gram-positive bacteria, vancomycin and teicoplanin were active. Additionally, arbekacin was active against S. aureus clinical isolates and ampicillin was active against E. faecalis clinical isolates. Carbapenems were active against clinical isolates of Gram-positive bacteria, except for multi-drug resistant strains of Gram-positive bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant S. aureus. 2. As for clinical isolates of Gram-negative bacteria, meropenem was most active against Enterobacteriaceae among 13 antibiotics tested. Against P. aeruginosa clinical isolates, MIC90 of meropenem was the lowest among 13 antibiotics tested. In addition, resistant rate of meropenem and biapenem against P. aeruginosa clinical isolates was lower than those of the other carbapenems tested. 3. As main urinary pathogens showed no remarkable increase in resistance to carbapenems, it can be stated that carbapenems retain their position as the drug of first choice for severe infection.",S Eta and M Kawahara,"0368-2781 (Print)

6257,MAYBE,Feng2015,Article,"OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to characterize the molecular mechanism of coproduction of KPC-2 and NDM-1 in Citrobacter freundii. METHODS: C. freundii strain 112298 was isolated from a human case of septic shock in a Chinese teaching hospital. The major carbapenemase and ESBL genes were detected by PCR. The MIC values were determined by using VITEK 2 and antimicrobial susceptibility was judged by CLSI standards. The resistance plasmid was transferred into Escherichia coli by electroporation, followed by plasmid DNA isolation from the electroporant, and then fully sequenced and compared with closely related plasmids. RESULTS: Strain 112298 produces KPC-2 and NDM-1, encoded by the novel non-typeable plasmid p112298-KPC and an IncX3-type plasmid p112298-NDM, respectively. In p112298-KPC, a Tn1722-based blaKPC-2-carrying transposon is associated with several additional resistance modules, constituting a single MDR region. Assembly of these resistance modules is likely mediated by homologous recombination between five copies of IS26 elements at different sites within the MDR region. p112298-NDM is a very close relation of pNDM-HN380. blaNDM-1 in p112298-NDM is carried by a Tn125 variant, which differs from the prototype Tn125 as observed in pNDM-BJ01 by disruption of an upstream copy of ISAba125 by IS5 and absence of a downstream copy of ISAba125. CONCLUSIONS: Production of KPC-2 and NDM-1 by p112298-KPC and p112298-NDM, respectively, makes C. freundii 112298 highly resistant to carbapenems and, moreover, these two plasmids still harbour genes for resistance to cephalosporins, chloramphenicol, chromate, fosfomycin, quaternary ammonium, rifampicin and sulphonamides.",J Feng and Y Qiu and Z Yin and W Chen and H Yang and W Yang and J Wang and Y Gao and D Zhou,0305-7453,J Antimicrob Chemother,"China,Citrobacter freundii/drug effects/*enzymology/*gen,Conjugation, Genetic,Enterobacteriaceae Infections/*microbiology,Escherichia coli/genetics,Gene Transfer, Horizontal,Hospitals,Humans,Male,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Middle Aged,Plasmids/*analysis,Polymerase Chain Reaction,Shock, Septic/microbiology,beta-Lactamases/*genetics/secretion",2987--2991,{Coexistence of a novel KPC-2-encoding MDR plasmid and an NDM-1-encoding pNDM-HN380-like plasmid in a clinical isolate of Citrobacter freundii},NA,70,2015,11,"1460-2091

6362,MAYBE,Feuerriegel2012,Article,"BACKGROUND: Drug resistance displays a problem for the therapy of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections. For molecular resistance testing, it is essential to have precise knowledge on genomic variations involved in resistance development. However, data from high-incidence settings are only sparely available. Therefore we performed a systematic approach and analyzed a total of 97 M. tuberculosis strains from previously treated patients in Sierra Leone for mutations in katG, rpoB, rrs, rpsL, gidB, embB, pncA and where applicable in inhA and ahpC. Of the strains investigated 50 were either mono- or poly-resistant to isoniazid, rifampin, streptomycin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide or MDR and 47 fully susceptible strains served as controls. RESULTS: The majority of isoniazid and rifampin resistant strains had mutations in katG315 (71.9{\%}) and rpoB531 (50{\%}). However, rpoB mutations in codons 511, 516 and 533 were also detected in five rifampin susceptible strains. MIC determinations revealed low-level rifampin resistance for those strains. Thus, the sensitivity and specificity of sequencing of katG for detection of drug resistance were 86.7{\%} and 100{\%} and for sequencing of rpoB 100{\%} and 93.8{\%}, respectively.Strikingly, none of the streptomycin resistant strains had mutations in rrs, but 47.5{\%} harboured mutations in rpsL. Further changes were detected in gidB. Among ethambutol resistant strains 46.7{\%} had mutations at embB306. Pyrazinamide resistant strains displayed a variety of mutations throughout pncA. The specificities of sequencing of rpsL, embB and pncA for resistance detection were high (96-100{\%}), whereas sensitivities were lower (48.8{\%}, 73.3{\%}, 70{\%}). CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals a good correlation between data from molecular and phenotypic resistance testing in this high-incidence setting. However, the fact that particular mutations in rpoB are not linked to high-level resistance is challenging and demonstrates that careful interpretation of molecular resistance assays is mandatory. In addition, certain variations, especially in gidB, appear to be phylogenetically informative polymorphisms rather than markers for drug resistance.",S Feuerriegel and B Oberhauser and A G George and F Dafae and E Richter and S Rusch-Gerdes and S Niemann,1471-2180,BMC Microbiol,"*Drug Resistance, Bacterial,Antitubercular Agents/*pharmacology,Bacterial Proteins/genetics,DNA, Bacterial/chemistry/genetics,Genotype,Humans,Incidence,Microbial Sensitivity Tests/methods,Mycobacterium tuberculosis/*drug effects/*genetics,Sensitivity and Specificity,Sequence Analysis, DNA/*methods,Sierra Leone/epidemiology,Tuberculosis/epidemiology/*microbiology",90,{Sequence analysis for detection of first-line drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains from a high-incidence setting},NA,12,2012,NA,"1471-2180

ST80 was dominant in Europe and has increasingly been described from the Middle East. Herewe report the whole genome sequence of the first ST80 CA-MRSA from the USA. Methods: CA-MRSA isolate S0924 was obtained from a patient admitted to Cook County Hospital (Chicago, IL, USA) who came from Syria; the isolate belonged to spa type t044 and ST80. The whole genome sequence of S0924 was determined and compared with three previously published whole genome sequences of ST80 CA-MRSA from Europe and a newly sequenced ST80 CA-MRSA from the Netherlands (S1475). Results: Based on spa typing, SCCmec type and virulence gene profile, this US ST80 isolate is indistinguishable from the European CA-MRSA ST80 clone. SNP analysis within the conserved core genome showed clear differences between the strains with up to 144 SNPs differing between S0924 and strain S1800, an ST80 MRSA from Greece. The gene content showed 21 regions of difference between the US and European isolates, although these were largely restricted to mobile genetic elements. Phylogenetic reconstruction indicated that the European strains were more closely related to each other than to the US strain. The SNP data suggest that a common ancestor existed around two decades ago, indicating that the US and European ST80 strains are clonally linked. Conclusions: These data combined with the country of origin of the patient suggest that ST80 S0924 was probably relatively recently introduced into the USA from Syria.",A C Fluit and N Carpaij and E A M Majoor and R A Weinstein and A Aroutcheva and T W Rice and M J M Bonten and R J L Willems,"1460-2091

6712,MAYBE,Frigo2011,Article,"Background: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a major concern worldwide. AMR surveillance globally is crucial for guiding effective treatment and accordingly for public health purposes. In the former Soviet countries, the knowledge regarding AMR has been limited. However, in 2004 the Russian gonococcal antimicrobial susceptibility programme (RU-GASP), which now acts also under WHO protocols, was initiated. The aims of the present study were to examine and describe the prevalence of N gonorrhoeae AMR in 2010 in Russia, and reveal trends during 2005-2010. Methods: In 2010, N gonorrhoeae isolates (one isolate per patient; n=407) collected from 46 surveillance sites distributed in all eight Federal Districts of Russia were examined regarding their susceptibility to ceftriaxone, spectinomycin, azithromycin, penicillin G, ciprofloxacin, and tetracycline using agar dilution method, according to CLSI and WHO protocols. $\beta$-Lactamase production was identified using nitrocefin discs. Results: In 2010, the AMR (intermediate susceptibility) levels were as follows - ceftriaxone 0{\%} (0{\%}), spectinomycin 4.4{\%} (12.3{\%}), azithromycin 4.9{\%} (10.4{\%}), penicillin G 32.5{\%} (39.9{\%}), ciprofloxacin 53.2{\%} (3.0{\%}), and tetracycline 41.9{\%} (26.6{\%}). Three isolates (0.7{\%}) were resistant to all antimicrobials except ceftriaxone. During 2005-2010, the AMR has remained high to penicillin G, tetracycline, and ciprofloxacin. The proportion of resistant isolates to spectinomycin and azithromycin has ranged from 0{\%} (2005) to 7.2{\%} (2008), and 0.4{\%} (2008) to 4.9{\%} (2010), respectively. All isolates in 2005-2010 were susceptible to ceftriaxone. Nevertheless, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) distribution of ceftriaxone has rapidly shifted to higher MICs, and isolates at the breakpoint for intermediate susceptibility/resistance (0.25 mg/l; n=8 [2{\%}] in 2010) have rapidly increased over the years. Conclusions: The AMR of N gonorrhoeae in Russia is high and ceftriaxone (3250 mg) should be first-line for empirical treatment. If there are no access to ceftriaxone or in the presence of severe $\beta$lactam antimicrobial allergy, spectinomycin is recommended for use. However, despite exceedingly rare in most countries spectinomycin resistance is annually identified in Russia, and accordingly the level of this resistance is crucial to monitor.

Since 2000, antimicrobial resistance of H. pylori increased dramatically and evolved to multiresistance particularly to clarithromycin, metronidazole and more recently to fluoroquinolones. We studied 97 isolates of H. pylori collected from gastric biopsies of patients from Paris and Poitiers. These strains were all resistant to ciprofloxacin. The MIC was determined using the agar dilution reference method (breakpoint 1 mg/L). The QRDR of gyrA gene was sequenced for all the strains. Among the 97 studied isolates, 94 harbored at least one mutation already described in the QRDR region of gyrA (T87I n = 23, N87K n = 32, D91N n = 30, D91G n = 7, D91Y n = 6), two harbored a mutation never previously described (D91H and A88P). The role of these two new mutations was assessed by a transformation of the gyrA wild type strain J99 with each one of the gyrA amplified DNA of the resistant strains. One strain was resistant (ciprofloxacin MIC 8 mg/L) without any mutation in the gyrA and gyrB genes.

In Chile, between 55{\%} and 79{\%} of people are colonized by H. pylori. At present, therapeutic strategies to eradicate the bacterium depend on the knowledge of its resistance to antibiotics. The clarithromycin resistance in H. pylori is associated with point mutations in the 23S rRNA. This study analyzes 23S rRNA gene mutations and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for clarithromycin in H. pylori isolates from patients of the metropolitan region of Chile. MATERIALS AND METHODS: H. pylori isolates from 50 dyspeptic patients with no history of clarithromycin exposure were tested for clarithromycin resistance by agar dilution method. Resistant strains were analyzed for mutations in the 23S rRNA gene by polymerase chain reaction-based restriction fragment length polymorphism and sequencing. RESULTS: Primary resistance was observed in 10 isolates (20{\%}). A single mutation was detected in four of the 10 isolates and two or more mutations in the other six cases. The C2147G transversion and G1939A, T1942C, and A2142G transitions in the peptidyltransferase region of domain V were novel.

The aim of this study was to characterize biofilm formation, antibiotic resistance, SCCmec type, and genetic relatedness in clinical isolates of Staphylococcus cohnii, Staphylococcus hominis, and Staphylococcus sciuri recovered from humans. Methods: Clinically relevant isolates of S. cohnii (n = 15), S. hominis (n = 9), and S. sciuri (n = 6), were collected from patients. Biofilm formation was evaluated using crystal violet staining, drug susceptibility was assessed using the broth microdilution method, and methicillin resistance was measured using the cefoxitin disk test. SCCmec was typed using 2 different methodologies, and genetic relatedness was determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Results: Sixty percent (9/15) of S. cohnii, 33{\%} (3/9) of S. hominis, and 50{\%} (3/6) of S. sciuri isolates were categorized as weak producers of biofilm. None of the isolates were resistant to vancomycin or linezolid. All 3 species showed a high resistance ({\textgreater} 66{\%}) to ampicillin, levofloxacin, erythromycin, and ceftriaxone, and the majority of the isolates were methicillin-resistant. PFGE revealed that the S. cohnii isolates comprised 1 dominant clone. Conclusions: The S. cohnii, S. hominis, and S. sciuri isolates analyzed in this study showed a high methicillin resistance and resistance to other antimicrobials. The results of this study strongly suggest that coagulase-negative staphylococci harbour new SCCmec elements.

7156,MAYBE,George2015,Article,"LEARNING OBJECTIVE {\#}1: Diagnosing Daptomycin nonsusceptible vancomycin resistant enterococcus faecium. LEARNING OBJECTIVE {\#}2: Identify risk factors for the development daptomycin nonsusceptible vancomycin resistant enterococcus. CASE: A 76-year-old male with history of coronary artery disease and chronic kidney disease stage IIIB developed abdominal pain for 7 days prior to presenting to the emergency room. The patient was afebrile with laboratory studies significant for a WBC of 13.6 thousand/cumm, troponin of 0.04 ng/m, and GFR of 49 mL/min, which was similar to the patient's baseline renal function. Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast revealed a colon mass in proximal transverse colon near the area of the hepatic flexure. Blood cultures drawn 12 h apart revealed vancomycin resistant enterococcus (VRE) faecium. This particular isolate had a non-susceptibility Etest to daptomycin with a mean inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 12 $\mu$g/mL, with sensitivity to linezolid. Colonoscopy revealed an ulcerated non-obstructing large mass in the proximal transverse colon which was biopsied. Pathology was negative for any malignancy but revealed acute necro-inflammatory debris and lamina propria hemorrhage. Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) revealed small vegetations on the anterior mitral valve leaflet. The patient was treated successfully with intravenous linezolid and gentamicin for a total of 8 weeks with repeat TEE showing resolution of the previously seen vegetation. DISCUSSION: The first case of VRE endocarditis that met the Duke Criteria was reported in 1996. Native valve endocarditis secondary to enterococci account for 14-17 {\%} of cases among patients over the age of 60. Enterococci are considered to be susceptible if the MIC is less than 4 $\mu$g/mL and have intermediate resistance once the MIC are between 8 and 16 $\mu$g/mL. VRE colonization has been shown to have a higher incidence amongst renal transplant and hemodiayslsis patients. There are limited case reports of enterococci faecium causing endocarditis. We report a rare case of daptomycin nonsusceptable vancomycin resistant enterococcus faecium (DNS-VRE) causing endocarditis in a patient with an underlying benign colon mass. It was believed that the source of the isolate was the ulcerated colon mass. The reported patient fulfilled the modified Duke Criteria for endocarditis with 2 major criteria (ie positive blood cultures for enterococci and mitral valve vegetation). DNS-VRE is an extremely rare isolate, however several risk factors for DNSVRE isolation have been suggested via retrospective analysis including immunosuppression, duration of hospitalization, indwelling devices thought to foster biofilm formation on prosethetic devices, and previous daptomycin exposure. Pfaller MA et al. 2005 found only 0.6 {\%} (10/1560) of isolates among VRE species were DNS-VRE. At the present time, little is known about the emergence or the incidence of DNSE isolates. Kelesidis T et al. 2011 report that less than 2 {\%} of enterococci isolates were daptomycin nonsusceptible with MIC of ≥4 $\mu$g/mL. The rising reports of DNS-VRE is concerning. We report a case in which the MIC was found to be 12 $\mu$g/mL suggesting that this isolate was truly DNS-VRE. Daptomycin is the only antibiotic with in vitro bactericidal activity against VRE that has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Based on susceptibility breakpoints approved by the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute, daptomycin has in vitro activity against {\textgreater}90{\%} of enterococcal isolates. Dohmen PM et al. 2012 outlines daptomycin for the treatment of infective endocarditis through one of the largest trials involving infective endocarditis and suggests that ≥8 mg/kg dosing of daptomycin has a higher clinical success rate (90 {\%}) compared to standard dosing (4 mg/kg). At the current time there exists no recommendations from the Infectious Disease Society of America regarding treatment for DNS-VRE infections.

Although this organism appears to have a predilection for the most vulnerable patients, community-acquired A. baumannii infection is an increasing cause for concern. The increase in A. baumannii infections has paralleled the alarming development of resistance it has demonstrated. The persistence of this organism in healthcare facilities, its inherent hardiness and its resistance to antibiotics results in it being a formidable emerging pathogen. This review aims to put into perspective the threat posed by this organism in hospital and community settings, describes new information that is changing our view of Acinetobacter virulence and resistance, and calls for greater understanding of how this multifaceted organism came to be a major pathogen.",T D Gootz and A Marra,"1478-7210

Molecular and phenotypical investigations of the clinical isolates were performed. Methods: Antibiotic susceptibilites of K. pneumoniae were determined by Vitek2 and E-test. DNA from K. pneumoniae were screened by PCR for the presence of KPC, VIM, IMP, NDM-1 and Oxa-48 $\beta$-lactamases. Transferability of Oxa-48 was tested by transformation of plasmid DNA into E. coli. Results: Ertapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae were isolated from rectal swabs and urine samples from seven patients during an outbreak. Of these seven patients, two were only colonized, three exhibited urinary tract infections and two patients were severely ill suffering from sepsis and/or pneumonia due to ertapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae. Infected patients were successfully treated with high dose meropenem and gentamicin, and, in case of pneumonia, in addition with inhalative colistin. All K. pneumoniae were resistant to penicillins, cephalosporins, ertapenem and fluoroquinolones. Some of the strains exhibited elevated MICs towards meropenem, doripenem or imipenem, but still remained susceptible. Oxa-48 was identified by PCR and sequencing in all K. pneumoniae isolates from the seven patients. In one of these patients an Oxa-48 producing Escherichia coli was isolated from rectal swabs in addition to the Oxa-48 producing K. pneumoniae. In vitro transfer of Oxa- 48 containing plasmid DNA from K. pneumoniae and E. coli into highly susceptible E. coli resulted in resistance against penicillins, cephalosporins and ertapenem. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an outbreak of Oxa-48 producing K. pneumoniae in Germany.

Integrons as genetic reservoirs play major roles in dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report carriage of class 1 and 2 integrons and associated gene cassettes in H. pylori isolates from Iran. This crosssectional study was conducted in Tehran among 110 patients with H. pylori infection. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) for H. pylori strains were assessed by the micro broth dilution method. Class 1 and 2 integrons were detected using PCR. In order to determine gene cassettes, amplified fragments were subjected to DNA sequencing of both amplicon strands. The prevalence of resistance to clarithromycin, metronidazole, clarithromycin, tetracycline, amoxicillin, rifampin, and levofloxacin were 68.2{\%} (n=75), 25.5{\%} (n=28), 24.5{\%} (n=27), 19.1{\%} (n=21), 18.2{\%} (n=20) and 16.4{\%} (n=18), respectively. Frequency of multidrug resistance among H. pylori isolates was 12.7{\%}. Class 2 integron was detected in 50 (45.5{\%}) and class 1 integron in 10 (9.1{\%}) H. pylori isolates. The most predominant gene cassette arrays in class 2 integron bearing H. pylori were included sateraaadA1, dfrA1sat2aadA1, blaoxa2 and, aadB whereas common gene cassette arrays in class 1 integron were aadBaadA1cmlA6, aacA4, blaoxa2, and catB3.

Methods: From October 2012 to March 2015, meropenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae were detected in 45 samples from seven patients at Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark. In silico resistance genes, Inc plasmid types and STs (MLST) were obtained from WGS data from 24 meropenem-resistant isolates (13 C. freundii, 6 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 4 Escherichia coli and 1 Klebsiella oxytoca) and 1 meropenem-susceptible K. oxytoca. The sequences of the meropenem-resistant C. freundii isolates were compared by phylogenetic analyses. In vitro susceptibility to 21 antimicrobial agents was tested. Furthermore, in vitro conjugation and plasmid characterization was performed. Results: From the seven patients, 13 highly clonal ST18 NDM-1-producing C. freundii were isolated. The ST18 NDM-1-producing C. freundii isolates were only susceptible to tetracycline, tigecycline, colistin and fosfomycin (except for the C. freundii isolates from Patient 2 and Patient 7, which were additionally resistant to tetracycline). The E. coli and K. pneumoniae from different patients belonged to different STs, indicating in vivo transfer of blaNDM-1 in the individual patients. This was further supported by in vitro conjugation and detection of a 154 kb IncA/C2 plasmid with blaNDM-1. Patient screenings failed to reveal any additional cases. None of the patients had a history of recent travel abroad and the source of the blaNDM-1 plasmid was unknown.

Here, to the best of our knowledge we describe for the first time in Turkey two NDM-1- producing Acinetobacter baumannii isolates recovered from intensive care unit patients. The presence of blaNDM-1 was detected by PCR and confirmed by sequencing. The clonal relationship was assessed by PFGE and multilocus sequence typing. Both isolates were positive for blaNDM-1 and were attributed with the sequence type 85.

8610,MAYBE,Hidron2009,Article,"Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), usually known as a nosocomial pathogen, has emerged as the predominant cause of skin and soft-tissue infections in many communities. Concurrent with the emergence of community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA), there have been increasing numbers of reports of community-acquired necrotising pneumonia in young patients and others without the classic health-care-associated risk factors. Community-onset necrotising pneumonia due to CA-MRSA is now recognised as an emerging clinical entity with distinctive clinical features and substantial morbidity and mortality. A viral prodrome (eg, influenza or influenza-like illness) followed by acute onset of shortness of breath, sepsis, and haemoptysis is the most frequent clinical presentation. The best treatment of this partly toxin-mediated disease has not been clearly defined. Whereas cases of CA-MRSA pneumonia have now been reported from almost every continent, the overall burden of disease of this emerging syndrome remains incompletely described.

The MRSA (strain NN47) belonged to multilocus sequence type (ST) 8 and exhibited spa363 (t024), agr1, staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) type IVa, and coagulase type III. It was positive for Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) and the arginine catabolic mobile element (ACME). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) demonstrated that the MRSA was the USA300 clone, which is the predominant community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) in the US. Strain NN47 was divergent, in terms of the spa type and patterns of PFGE and plasmids, from the USA300-0114 type strain or USA300 strain NN36, previously isolated from a visitor (Indian girl) from the US. Strain NN47 was resistant to erythromycin, in addition to $\beta$-lactam agents (e.g., oxacillin). These data demonstrate the first emergence of the USA300 clone in Japanese children who have never been abroad and have had no contact with foreigners (and therefore, the first USA300 spread in Japan), and also emergence of multiple divergent strains of the USA300 clone in Japan.

The first case was a Swedish patient who had previously been treated in India. Recently, blaNDM-1-producing bacteria were identified from environment in New Delhi and Vietnam. Also, the blaNDM-1 gene was found on a mobile plasmid in an Acinetobacter lwoffii isolate fromchicken meat. We reported the first case of NDM-1 producing Escherichia coli in Japan from a patient who had been treated in India in 2009. Subsequently, we determined complete sequence of the blaNDM-1- positive plasmid (pNDM-1-Dok01) of IncA/C which suggested a possible origin fromplant pathogens such as Pseudoxanthomonas and Xanthomonas spp. We report another NDM-1 plasmid in Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from the second Japanese patient who locally acquired the blaNDM-1 producing organism in Japan. From September 15, 2010 to December 28, 2010, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of the Japanese government conducted nation-wide surveillance of multi-drug resistant Enterobacteriaceae, which showed resistance to three classes of antibiotics, carbapenems, fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides. From a woman over ninety years old who resided in a nursing home, multi-drug resistant K. pneumoniae (NDM-1- Saitama) was isolated from urine and subsequent PCR analysis revealed the blaNDM-1 gene. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) indicated that the strain NDM-1-Saitama belonged to sequence type ST42 which had not been reported previously. Complete sequencing and gap closing by PCR demonstrated a 49,441bp IncFII plasmid which bears 53 genes. The plasmid pNDM-1- Saitama consists of 22kb backbone and 27kb multi-drug resistant region. Half of the backbone showed 100{\%} perfect match of the sequence of K. pneumoniae plasmid pKP048which contains blaKPC-2. The second half of the backbone has only partial similarity to the plasmids with blaNDM-1 and blaCTX-M3. The multi-drug resistant region of pNDM-1-Saitama contains 13 drug resistant elements including blaNDM-1, bleMBL, blaDHA-1, sul1, armA, mel, and mph2. The complete sequence of an ISAba125 insertion sequence in the upstream of the blaNDM-1 gene suggests horizontal transfer of the blaNDM-1 gene between Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter . The possible recombination events between NDM-1 plasmids and plasmids carrying KPC and CTXM-3 or A. baumannii genome are suggested. The blaNDM-1 gene is always followed by the bleomycin resistant protein gene bleMBL. The blaNDM-1- bleMBL elements are followed either by blaDHA-1 and ampR or molecular chaperones groES and groER.

This organism is usually isolated from wastewater and is closely related to D. acidovorans (formerly Comamonas acidovorans ). To date, there is only one report describing D. tsuruhatensis as the causative agent of a human infection in 2011. Although class 3 integron was reported in one D. tsuruhatensis strain, the functions of associated gene cassettes werenot demonstrated.We present the genetic context of integron carrying bla IMP-1 gene in D. tsuruhatensis isolated from clinical specimen. Methods: Delftia species (CRS1243) was isolated from the peritoneal fluid of a stomach cancer patient and was considered as a colonizer. The bacterial identification and susceptibility testswere performed by the Vitek 2 GN and AST-N212. Species was identified using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The production of carbapenemase was screened with modified Hodge test. To determine the types of carbapenemase, we used a combination test of carbapenem and b-lactamase inhibitor disks. The multiplex PCR was performed for detection of NDM, SIM, GIM, VIM, SPM, and IMP enzymes encoding genes. The genetic context of integron carrying bla IMP-1 genewas derived fromprimerwalking. To determine the location of integron, we performed plasmid extraction and conjugation. Results: The isolated strain was identified as D. acidovorans with a probability level of 99{\%} by Vitek 2, but confirmed as D. tsuruhatensis by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The isolate was suspected as a metallo-b-lactamase producer by modified Hodge and carbapenemase inhibition tests. The bla IMP-1 gene was detected by PCR and sequencing. The isolatewas non-susceptible to amikacin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, cefotaxime, cefepime, imipenem, and colistin, but susceptible to aztreonam, minocycline, tigecycline, and cotrimoxazole. The carbapenem resistance was not transferred to Escherichia coli J53 (azide R). D. tsuruhatensis CRS1243 harbored bla IMP-1 gene in class 1 integron located on Tn402 -like transposon. Between the 5'-conserved segment and the tni module, the gene cassettes were orfE, aac(6')-31-like, orfE, orfE, aac(6')-II , aacA7, bla IMP-1, aacA7 aac(6')-II and qacE2 .

8905,MAYBE,Hososaka2007,Article,"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has been defined as S. aureus having the mecA gene or showing a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of oxacillin higher than 4 mg/l. However, some clinical isolates are mecA-positive and oxacillin-susceptible. Therefore, we surveyed the occurrence of S. aureus having the mecA gene and an MIC of oxacillin of less than 2 mg/l (oxacillin-susceptible MRSA; OS-MRSA) in a total of 480 strains of S. aureus collected from 11 hospitals in different location in Japan isolated from 2003 through 2005. We found 6 strains matching the criteria for OS-MRSA. All 6 strains were staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCC) mec-positive, without exception, and 4 strains showed the SCCmec type III-variant, which is unique in Japan. These OS-MRSAs were least resistant to oxacillin among the MRSAs tested and they were within the susceptible range to seven other beta-lactam antibiotics tested. Thus, OS-MRSA may become a high-resistant MRSA upon the treatment of patients with beta-lactam antibiotics. To characterize whether these OS-MRSAs were hospital-acquired or community-acquired MRSAs, we tested for the presence of the genes encoding toxins. Genes encoding hemolysin, exfoliative toxin, enterotoxin, toxic shock syndrome toxin-1, and Panton-Valentine leukocidin were found in 6, 4, 0, 0, and 0 strains, respectively. These results revealed that OS-MRSAs could be classified as a new type of MRSA that exhibits properties distinguishable from either hospital- or community-acquired MRSA. Coagulase typing of the OS-MRSAs supported the above conclusion. In this study, the occurrence of OS-MRSA at a certain frequency was noted; precautions are called for in the classification of oxacillin-resistant S. aureus and in the treatment of OS-MRSA infection.",Y Hososaka and H Hanaki and H Endo and Y Suzuki and Z Nagasawa and Y Otsuka and T Nakae and K Sunakawa,"1341-321X (Print)

8951,MAYBE,Hrabak2013,Article,"Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas spp. are increasingly reported in many countries all over the world. Due to the resistance of those bacteria to almost all antibiotics (e.g.beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones),treatment options are seriously limited. In the Czech Republic, the incidence of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae seems to be low, restricted to only three cases detected between 2009 and 2010.Here, we describe molecular typing of 15 carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates identified in the Czech Republic during 2011. Five VIM-1-producing isolates belonging to sequence type (ST)11 and one VIM-4-producing isolate of ST1029 have been detected. blaVIM-1 and blaVIM-4 as a part of class 1 integrons were chromosomally located or carried by a plasmid belonging to A/C replicon type (blaVIM-4). KPC-3-producing isolates of ST512, recovered from six patients, caused an outbreak. Three more isolates producing KPC-2 enzyme belonged to ST258. Both blaKPCgenes were part of the Tn4401a transposon carried on plasmids of the pKpQIL type. The isolates were resistant to all antibiotics tested except colistin and/or gentamicin.Four of these 15 strains were recovered from patients repatriated to the Czech Republic from Greece and Italy.

9339,MAYBE,Irfan2008,Article,"BACKGROUND: This study was conducted to evaluate drug resistance amongst bacteremic isolates of febrile neutropenic patients with particular emphasis on emergence of carbapenem resistant Gram negative bacteria and vancomycin resistant Enterococcus species. METHODS: A descriptive study was performed by reviewing the blood culture reports from febrile neutropenic patients during the two study periods i.e., 1999-00 and 2001-06. Blood cultures were performed using BACTEC 9240 automated system. Isolates were identified and antibiotic sensitivities were done using standard microbiological procedures. RESULTS: Seven twenty six febrile neutropenic patients were admitted during the study period. A total of 5840 blood cultures were received, off these 1048 (18{\%}) were culture positive. Amongst these, 557 (53{\%}) grew Gram positive bacteria, 442 (42{\%}) grew Gram negative bacteria, 43 (4{\%}) fungi and 6 (1{\%}) anaerobes. Sixty (5.7{\%}) out of 1048 positive blood cultures were polymicrobial. In the Gram negative bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae was the predominant group; E. coli was the most frequently isolated organism in both study periods. Amongst non- Enterobacteriaceae group, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the commonest organism isolated during first study period followed by Acinetobacter spp. However, during the second period Acinetobacter species was the most frequent pathogen. Enterobacteriaceae group showed higher statistically significant resistance in the second study period against ceftriaxone, quinolone and piperacillin/tazobactam, whilst no resistance observed against imipenem/meropenem. The susceptibility pattern of Acinetobacter species shifted from sensitive to highly resistant one with significant p values against ceftriaxone, quinolone, piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem/meropenem. Amongst Gram positive bacteria, MRSA isolation rate remained static, vancomycin resistant Enterococcus species emerged in second study period while no Staphylococcus species resistant to vancomycin was noted. CONCLUSION: This rising trend of highly resistant organisms stresses the increasing importance of continuous surveillance system and stewardship of antibiotics as strategies in the overall management of patients with febrile neutropenia.",S Irfan and F Idrees and V Mehraj and F Habib and S Adil and R Hasan,1471-2334,BMC Infect Dis,"Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology,Bacteremia/complications/drug therapy/*microbiolog,Carbapenems/pharmacology,Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial,Enterobacteriaceae/drug effects/isolation {\&} purifi,Fever/complications/drug therapy/microbiology,Gram-Negative Bacteria/*drug effects/isolation {\&} p,Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections/drug therapy/*m,Gram-Positive Bacteria/*drug effects/isolation {\&} p,Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections/drug therapy/*m,Humans,Neutropenia/complications/microbiology,Pakistan,Vancomycin Resistance",80,{Emergence of Carbapenem resistant Gram negative and vancomycin resistant Gram positive organisms in bacteremic isolates of febrile neutropenic patients: a descriptive study},NA,8,2008,NA,"1471-2334

Eleven OXA-48 carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates were recovered from patients treated in nine different hospitals in Kuwait. Susceptibility testing to eighteen antibiotics was done using the E-test. PCR assays were performed for the detection of genes encoding extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) (blaCTX-M, blaSHV, and blaTEM) and carbapenemases (blaOXA-48, blaVIM, blaNDM, blaIMP, blaGIM, and blaKPC). STs were determined by Multilocus Sequence Typing. Seven Klebsiella pneumoniae, two Escherichia coli, one Enterobacter cloacae, and one Morganella morganii harbored the blaOXA-48 gene. The K. pneumoniae and E. coli belonged to seven and two different STs, respectively, which were not related to those reported from this region. The majority of the isolates carried either blaCTX-M or blaSHV genes and showed a multidrug-resistant phenotype, including resistance to tigecycline. Multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae harboring the blaOXA-48 gene are emerging in Kuwait with different STs compared to those identified in other countries of the region.

Their pathogenic potential differs distinctly: while strain J-2 is highly transmissible and multi-resistant, strain B is not. The aim of the present work is to investigate the proteome to reveal differences between these two strains. Methods: We employed a comparative proteomic approach involving twodimensional gel electrophoresis coupled to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry with isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) to map the proteomes of B and J-2 and to identify differentially expressed proteins. Results: We identified 1873 proteins and quantified 1769 proteins of which about 21{\%} were differentially expressed at statistically significant altered abundance between the two analysed strains. Functional analysis of the different abundant proteins showed they could be clustered into five major groups i. secreted factors; ii. cell wall/LPS/capsule; iii. chemotaxis; iv. motility {\&} attachment; v. adaption/protection. Within the functional clusters, upregulated proteins (q{\textless}0.05) involved in virulence were more common in strain J-2 than strain B, 17{\%} respectively 6{\%} of the total number of upregulated proteins. Conclusion: This work provides the first overview of P. aeruginosa strains J-2 and B on proteome changes occurring during adaptation to the CF lung and/or antibiotic treatments.

These isolates were from seven immunocompromised patients and from environmental swabs. ESBLs inhibited by clavulanic acid were detected by double-disk diffusion tests. Isoelectric focusing revealed that these isolates produced two to four beta-lactamases with pIs of 5.5, 6.1, 6.4, 7.6 or 8.2, and PCR detected the presence of bla(OXA-18), bla(SHV) and bla(TEM) genes in 24, 21 and two isolates, respectively. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis defined two dominant genotypic groups: group A (16 isolates) and group B (four isolates). Sequencing of PCR products from representative isolates identified the bla(OXA-18) gene and revealed nucleotide sequences belonging to the bla(SHV-1) and bla(TEM-1) genes. Isolates producing OXA-18 belonged to genomic group A and were isolated from four immunocompromised patients in the haematology and graft units, and from two wash-basins in the graft unit.

Colonization dynamics, characteristics, and risk factor data for CR-GNB are scarce in children. Aim: To examine the molecular characteristics of, and risk factors for nosocomial colonization with, carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacilli (CR-GNB) in hospitalized paediatric patients in a tertiary university hospital's paediatric units in Turkey. Methods: A prospective case-control study was performed at a university hospital in Istanbul, Turkey. Findings: A total of 1840 rectal swab specimens were collected from all 762 hospitalized children between March 2013 and October 2013. Among them, 176 (23{\%}) patients were colonized with CR-GNB. Of these, 72 (9{\%}) patients were colonized with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, 138 (18{\%}) with CR-non-fermenter Gram-negative bacilli (CR-NF) and 34 (4{\%}) with both. The median CR-GNB colonization time was 10 days (range: 1-116). The median duration of rectal colonization with CR-GNB was 8 days (range: 1-160). NDM (31{\%}) was the second most frequent carbapenemase identified in Acinetobacter baumannii isolates, and has not previously been detected in Turkey. All of the 17 patients colonized with NDM-producing A. baumannii were newborns in the neonatal intensive care unit. Independent risk factors for CR-GNB colonization were: age {\textless}1 year, nasogastric tube placement, presence of underlying chronic diseases, ampicillin usage, surgical intervention, and carbapenem use. Conclusion: This is the first description of NDM in A. baumannii in newborn units in Turkey. Carbapenem usage is a common independent risk factor for both CRE and CR-NF colonization, which underscores the importance of antibiotic stewardship programmes.",A Karaaslan and A Soysal and G {Altinkanat Gelmez} and E {Kepenekli Kadayifci} and G Söyletir and M Bakir and G Soyletir and M Bakir,"1532-2939

It is probably safe to assume that immunosuppression is a risk factor for H. parainfluenzae infections.

11079,YES,Kozodoy2015,Article,"Introduction: Nocardia is a group of modified acid fast filamentous branching bacilli that are characteristically gram positive. Although Nocardia species normally exist as soil saprophytes, they have increasingly been isolated as infectious agents in immunocompromised and immunocompetant patients. Infections range from focal pulmonary nocardiosis to widespread disseminated disease. Case presentation: A 23-year-old African American female was admitted to our hospital with progressively worsening shortness of breath accompanied by productive non-bloody cough with anterior neck mass. Past medical history was remarkable for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), lupus nephritis, ESRD on hemodialysis secondary to SLE, and history of ischemic stroke. She was on prednisone 20 mg daily and azathioprine 50 mg daily. On admission her temperature was 98.6°C with 91{\%} oxygen saturation on ambient air. Her physical exam was remarkable for fluctuant anterior neck mass and dullness to percussion in left lower lobe with decreased bronchial breath sounds as well as focal rhonchi in the same area. Laboratory analysis yielded a white blood cell count of 23.5x103/L (90{\%} neutrophils, 4{\%} lymphocytes, no bands). Blood cultures were negative. Chest CT revealed multiple new large basilar left pleural-based loculated effusions. CT of neck revealed left large homogeneous soft tissue mass and CT head revealed multiple ring-enhancing lesions at grey-white matter interface of cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres. She underwent CT guided drainage of the neck abscess and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) with Nocardia species isolated from AFB cultures. Ribosomal RNA gene sequencing (16S rRNA) was done with subsequent identification of Nocardia otitidiscaviarum. This strain of nocardia was trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) resistant. A year-long therapy with TMP/SMX, amikacin and meropenem was initiated. Follow up evaluation showed clinical and radiographic improvement of disseminated nocardia infection after 2 months. Discussion: Although Nocardia species are a rare cause of infection, its mortality rate (31{\%}) is considerably greater than that of other agents that can cause abscesses ({\textless}10{\%}). Accurate diagnosis and early treatment are challenging especially in light of recent alarming reports of increased in vitro sulfonamide resistance.

NDM-1 is also associated with resistance to many other classes of antibiotics. The enzyme was first identified in organisms isolated from a patient in Sweden who had previously received medical treatment in India, but it is now recognized as endemic throughout India and Pakistan and has spread worldwide. The gene encoding NDM-1 has been found predominantly in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. We describe the isolation NDM-1-producing organisms from two patients in Toronto, Ontario. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an organism producing NDM-1 that was locally acquired in Canada. We also discuss the evidence that NDM-1 can affect bacterial species other than E. coli and K. pneumoniae, the limited options for treatment and the difficulty laboratories face in detecting organisms that produce NDM-1. {\textcopyright} 2011 Canadian Medical Association or its licensors.",J V Kus and M Tadros and A Simor and D E Low and A J McGeer and B M Willey and C Larocque and K Pike and I A Edwards and H Dedier and R Melano and D A Boyd and M R Mulvey and L Louie and C Okeahialam and M Bayley and C Whitehead and D Richardson and L Carr and F Jinnah and S M Poutanen,"0820-3946

11382,YES,Lafeuille2013,Article,"Six multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were recovered from injured Libyan combatants. Production of carbapenemase was screened by using commercial combination tablets from Rosco combined with a temocillin disk. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing were used to detect several carbapenemase genes and to characterize their genetic environment. Genetic support was studied by mating-out assays. Plasmid size was identified by the KADO method. PCR and sequencing allowed characterization of plasmid scaffold. Genotyping was performed by pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing. PCR was used to check for the presence of nine genes linked to virulence in K. pneumoniae. No carbapenemase was identified by Rosco disks, but all isolates showed high-level temocillin resistance. All of them harbored blaOXA-48 in the transposon Tn1999.2, on a self-conjugative plasmid of about 60 kb, similar to pOXA-48. PFGE revealed three clusters in which isolates were genetically related: The first comprised FM9 and FM10, and the second comprised FM1, FM4, and FM5. FM2 formed a third distinct clone. Sequence types ST101, ST11, and ST147 were identified in keeping with PFGE results. The entB, ycfM, ybtS, and mrkD genes were detected in all isolates, and kfu gene was present in the three ST101 strains. This work confirms the current and successful spread of blaOXA-48 by horizontal dissemination of a single IncL/M plasmid through different genetic backbones with strong epidemic potential. It also highlights the need for rapid and reliable phenotypic detection methods.

11730,MAYBE,Lee2006a,Article,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to characterize the genetic basis of beta-lactam resistance developed in clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae after exposure to cefuroxime. METHODS: Clinical features of two episodes of liver abscess caused by K. pneumoniae in a diabetic patient were reported. Four isolates (KP(1)/KP(2) and KP(3)/KP(4)) of K. pneumoniae were recovered from cultures of blood/pus in the first and second episodes, respectively. Laboratory investigation of the K. pneumoniae isolates included genotyping by PFGE, resistance gene analysis by PCR amplification and DNA sequencing, and outer membrane protein analysis by SDS-PAGE. RESULTS: KP(3) and KP(4) were recovered after a 21 day cefuroxime therapy and demonstrated identical genotypes to that of KP(1) and KP(2). However, compared with KP(1) and KP(2), emerging resistance to piperacillin, cefalotin, cefuroxime and cefoxitin was observed. The other antibiotics tested, except ampicillin, retained the same effectiveness against the four isolates, although increases (4- to 8-fold) in the MICs of cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cefepime, flomoxef and aztreonam were observed in KP(3) and KP(4). None of the isolates produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases or plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases. Deficiency in the expression of an outer membrane protein (OmpK35) was observed in the cefuroxime-resistant isolates, KP(3) and KP(4). CONCLUSIONS: The increased resistance to cephalosporins in these clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae after exposure to cefuroxime might be related to the loss of OmpK35.",C H Lee and J H Chia and C Chu and T L Wu and J W Liu and L H Su,"0305-7453

11983,YES,Lewis2013,Article,"OBJECTIVES: To describe the phenotypic and genetic characteristics of the first two cases of extended-spectrum cephalosporin (ESC)-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae in South Africa, one of which was associated with verified cefixime treatment failure. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two ESC-resistant N. gonorrhoeae isolates were cultured from the urethral discharge of two men who have sex with men (MSM). One man reported a persistent urethral discharge that had failed to respond to previous therapy with oral cefixime. Agar dilution MICs were determined for eight antibiotics. beta-Lactam-associated resistance mutations were identified through PCR-based amplification and sequencing for several key genes: penA, mtrR and its promoter, porB1b (penB), ponA and pilQ. For molecular epidemiological characterization, full-length porB gene sequencing, N. gonorrhoeae multiantigen sequence typing (NG-MAST) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) were performed. RESULTS: Both isolates were resistant to cefixime, ciprofloxacin, penicillin and tetracycline and intermediate/resistant to azithromycin, but susceptible to ceftriaxone, gentamicin and spectinomycin. Both isolates had the type XXXIV penA mosaic allele in addition to previously described resistance mutations in the mtrR promoter (A deletion), porB1b (penB) (G101K and A102N) and ponA1 (L421P). Both isolates had an identical NG-MAST sequence type (ST4822) and MLST sequence type (ST1901). CONCLUSIONS: Both isolates were resistant to cefixime and possessed a number of identical mutations in key genes contributing to ESC resistance in N. gonorrhoeae. The two isolates contained the type XXXIV penA mosaic allele and belonged to a successful international MSM-linked multidrug-resistant gonococcal clone (MLST ST1901) associated with several cefixime treatment failures in Europe and North America.",D A Lewis and C Sriruttan and E E Muller and D Golparian and L Gumede and D Fick and J {de Wet} and V Maseko and J Coetzee and M Unemo and E E Müller and D Golparian and L Gumede and D Fick and J {de Wet} and V Maseko and J Coetzee and M Unemo,"0305-7453

12065,MAYBE,Li2016h,Article,"Tigecycline (TIG) resistance is a growing concern because this antibiotic is regarded as one of the last resorts to treat infections caused by multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) bacteria. Information regarding TIG-resistant Escherichia coli isolates is scarce. In this study, we report the emergence of high-level TIG resistance in a longitudinal series of XDR E. coli isolates collected during TIG treatment. Whole-genome sequencing was performed for six E. coli strains harbouring bla(NDM-5) and genomic comparison revealed two amino acid substitutions. Mutation in rpsJ could be a significant factor conferring TIG resistance in these isolates. The fitness cost of TIG resistance in resistant strains was evaluated by determining the relative growth rate, indicating that TIG resistance reduced fitness by ca. 7{\%}. This study is the first report to demonstrate high-level TIG resistance in E. coli in vivo. In addition, we report the first treatment-emergent minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) development of TIG from 1mg/L to 64 mg/L in E. coli.

12096,MAYBE,Liao2008,Article,"OBJECTIVES: (i) To distinguish Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates in Shanghai by porB typing; (ii) to ascertain the congruence of porB DNA sequence typing with cases linked epidemiologically; (iii) to determine the association of specific PorB mutations with antimicrobial resistance to penicillin or tetracycline. METHODS: porB DNA sequences of 174 N. gonorrhoeae isolates, collected from 143 male patients and 31 female sexual partners in Shanghai were determined. Phylogenetic analysis was used to determine sequence associations and concordance with epidemiologically linked cases. PorB protein sequences were compared with the wild-type sequence to identify mutations associated with antimicrobial resistance to penicillin and tetracycline. RESULTS: porB1a genotypes comprised 27.0{\%} of the isolates and included 15 distinct DNA sequences, while 73.0{\%} of the isolates carried porB1b genotypes with 63 distinct DNA sequences. porB DNA sequence typing was congruent with patient-reported sexual contacts. In addition, porB DNA sequence analysis revealed a number of strains with identical DNA sequences not identified through traditional epidemiological methods. The porB1b isolates had a significantly higher percentage of chromosomally mediated resistance to tetracycline and higher MIC50s to penicillin and ciprofloxacin. G120K/A121D mutations were observed in 71.1{\%} of PIB isolates and were associated with resistance to penicillin and/or tetracycline. The majority of the PIA isolates (82.1{\%}) also carried G120D/A121G double mutations. The index of discrimination for porB DNA sequence analysis was 95{\%}. CONCLUSIONS: The porB1b genotype was found to be predominant in Shanghai. porB DNA sequence typing was sufficiently discriminatory for differentiating N. gonorrhoeae isolates and was congruent with epidemiological linkages.

12277,MAYBE,Liu2013,Article,"There have been increasing reports of blaOXA-23-carrying strains of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB), which has become a significant public health concern in Taiwan. To determine the origin of these CRAB strains, the prevalence of CRAB and blaOXA-23-carrying CRAB in a regional hospital was analysed retrospectively. The genome of A. baumannii TYTH-1 was completely sequenced and annotated. Multiple comparative genomics studies, including phylogenetic analysis, functional comparison via the Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COGs) database, and determination of variance in GC profiles in the whole genome and gene arrangements in resistance islands, were performed using 11 completely sequenced A. baumannii genomes. bla OXA-23-carrying CRAB isolates became dominant clones in 2007. A comparative genomics analysis revealed a common strain lineage between Taiwanese strains (TYTH-1 and TCDC-AB0715) and Chinese strains (MDR-TJ and MDR-ZJ06). Phylogenetic studies and GC profiles showed that the genome of TYTH-1 was closest to MDR-ZJ06. However, the resistance island of TYTH-1 (RI TYTH-1) was nearly identical to that of RIMDT-TJ. The functional category for COGs was similar in the tested genomes. The results reveal that dissemination of blaOXA-23-carrying CRAB in Taiwan may have been mediated by the transfer of people between Taiwan and China during 2007. The global spread of CRAB is now a worldwide public health problem. In Taiwan, the government needs to focus more attention on the importance of identifying and tracing resistant pathogens and issuing notifications of CRAB infections. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V. and the International Society of Chemotherapy.",C C Liu and C Y Tang and H Y Kuo and C W Lu and K C Chang and M L Liou,"0924-8579

12646,MAYBE,LuizRdos2013,Article,"OBJECTIVES: This study has used a combination of clinical information, spoligotyping, and georeferencing system to elucidate the genetic diversity of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates circulating in a TB-prevalent municipality of Northeast Brazil. METHODS: A total of 115 M. tuberculosis strains were isolated from pulmonary tuberculosis patients from January 2007 to March 2008 in Fortaleza. Drug susceptibility and spoligotyping assays were performed and place of residence of the patients were georeferenced. RESULTS: Of the M. tuberculosis strains studied, 51 (44.3{\%}) isolates were resistant to at least one drug (R-TB) and 64 (55.7{\%}) were sensitive to all the drugs tested (S-TB). A high frequency of resistance was found in previously treated cases (84{\%}) and among new cases (16{\%}; p{\textless}0.001). A total of 74 (64{\%}) isolates were grouped into 22 spoligotyped lineages, while 41 (36{\%}) isolates were identified as new. Among the predominant genotypes, 33{\%} were Latim American Mediterranean (LAM), 12{\%} Haarlem (H), and 5{\%} U. There was no association of geographic distribution of RT-TB patients as compared to the controls and also the geographic location to the spoligotype patterns. The geospatial analysis revealed that 24 (23{\%}) patients (hot spot zones) either shared the same residence or lived in a close neighborhood of a case. Among these concentration zones, the patients lived in the same residence and shared a common genotype pattern and resistance pattern. DISCUSSION: It was observed that the spoligopatterns family distribution was similar to that reported for South America, prevailing the LAM and H lineages. A high rate-case among the resistant TB group occurs as a result of transmitted and acquired resistance.

This represented a dramatic increase in ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae compared to previous years. To investigate the epidemiology and to characterize the resistance mechanisms of the isolates, a study was initiated. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by means of the Etest and the disc diffusion method. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production was identified by clavulanic acid synergy test and confirmed with PCR amplification followed by DNA sequencing. DNA profiles of the isolates were examined with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). All isolates were resistant or exhibited reduced susceptibility to cefadroxil, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, piperacillin/tazobactam, ciprofloxacin, tobramycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. They produced ESBL of the CTX-M-15 type, and the involvement of a single K. pneumoniae clone was shown.

Antimicrobial susceptibility, SCCmec type, spa type and the presence of Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) genes were determined for all HA-MRSA isolates in an Iranian referral hospital. In this study of 48 HA-MRSA isolates, 13 (27{\%}), three (6.2{\%}), five (10.4{\%}) and one (2{\%}) belonged to SCCmec subtypes IVa, IVb, IVc and IVd, respectively. Only two isolates (4.2{\%}) belonged to SCCmec types V Notably, one isolate was found to harbour concurrent SCCmec subtypes IVb and IVd. MRSA containing SCCmec subtype IVb, IVc and IVd as well as type V isolates were all susceptible to chloramphenicol, clindamycin and rifampicin, while the sensitivity to these antibiotics was lower among MRSA containing SCCmec subtype IVa. The most frequently observed spa ttype was t037, accounting for 88{\%} (22/25). Three other spa type was t002, t1816 and t4478.

13129,MAYBE,Marcano2008,Article,"BACKGROUND: VIM-type metallo-betalactamases (MBLs) exhibit hydrolytic activity against most betalactam antibiotics, including carbapenems. So far, VIM-type-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates had not been reported in Latin America. METHODOLOGY: In July 2005, a carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae was isolated from a urine sample collected from a 7-year-old girl hospitalized at the Hospital de Ni{\~{n}}os {""}J. M. de los R{\'{i}}os{""} in Caracas, Venezuela. This strain was identified using conventional biochemical tests. The susceptibility analysis was conducted by disk diffusion, and MICs for Imipenem and Meropenem were performed by agar dilution. For the phenotypic detection of MBL we used the Imipenem-EDTA/SMA double-disk diffusion method. The hydrolytic activity against carbapenems was determined by the Masuda microbiological method. Purified protein was subjected to isoelectric focusing (IEF). Detection of antimicrobial resistance genes was performed by PCR amplification with specific VIM primers. RESULTS: The strain showed resistance to most betalactam antibiotics, quinolones and amynoglicosides, but remained susceptible to Aztreonam and Cefepime. The use of phenotypic and microbiological methods detected the presence of a metallobetalactamase. By IEF we visualized three bands at pI 5.4, 7.6 and 7.9, corresponding to reduced-spectrum betalactamases, and a band at pI 5.8 that corresponded to the metallobetalactamase. PCR screening of bla genes revealed the presence of blaVIM, with an amplicon of 261 bp. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of a MBL-mediated carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae in Latin America, which constitutes a public health concern in our region since their transference to other microorganisms with multiple antibiotic resistance mechanisms will increase the antimicrobial resistance problem.",D Marcano and F Pasterán and M Rapoport and D Faccone and C Ugarte and N Salgado and D Payares and E Spadola and Y López and G Maggi and M Galas and D Sánchez and F Pasteran and M Rapoport and D Faccone and C Ugarte and N Salgado and D Payares and E Spadola and Y Lopez and G Maggi and M Galas and D Sanchez,1972-2680,Journal of Infection in Developing Countries,",Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology,Aztreonam/pharmacology,Bacterial,Cephalosporins/pharmacology,Child,Cross Infection/microbiology,Drug Resistance,Female,Humans,Imipenem/pharmacology,Klebsiella Infections/*microbiology,Klebsiella infection,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Klebsiella pneumoniae/drug effects/genetics/*isola,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Multiple,Quinolones/pharmacology,Thienamycins/pharmacology,Urine/microbiology,Venezuela,antibiotic resistance,antiinfective agent,article,aztreonam,beta lactamase,beta-Lactam Resistance,beta-Lactamases/analysis/*biosynthesis/genetics,biosynthesis,case report,cefepime,cephalosporin derivative,child,cross infection,drug effect,female,genetics,human,imipenem,isolation and purification,meropenem,metabolism,microbiological examination,microbiology,multidrug resistance,quinolone derivative,thienamycin derivative,urine",241--244,{First isolation of a VIM-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae from a seven-year-old child in Venezuela},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L355896338 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=19722680{\&}id=doi:{\&}atitle=First+isolation+of+a+VIM-producing+Klebsiella+pneumoniae+from+a+seven-year-old+child+,2,2008,3,"From Duplicate 1 (First isolation of a VIM-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae from a seven-year-old child in Venezuela - Marcano, D; Pasteran, F; Rapoport, M; Faccone, D; Ugarte, C; Salgado, N; Payares, D; Spadola, E; Lopez, Y; Maggi, G; Galas, M; Sanchez, D)

We report the first verified treatment failure of gonorrhoea with 2 g of azithromycin (extended-release formulation) in Japan and characteristics of the corresponding N. gonorrhoeae isolates. METHODS: Pre- and post-treatment isolates (n = 4) were investigated by Etest for antimicrobial susceptibility. The isolates were examined for molecular epidemiology by multilocus sequence typing (MLST), N. gonorrhoeae multi-antigen sequence typing (NG-MAST) and multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA), and for the presence of azithromycin resistance determinants (23S rRNA gene mutations, erm genes and mtrR mutations). RESULTS: All isolates were resistant to azithromycin (MIC 4 mg/L) and ciprofloxacin, but remained susceptible to cefixime, ceftriaxone and spectinomycin. All isolates were assigned to MLST ST1901 and NG-MAST ST1407 and three of four isolates possessed MLVA profile 8-3-21-16-1. All isolates contained the previously described C2599T mutation (N. gonorrhoeae numbering) in all four 23S rRNA alleles and the previously described single-nucleotide (A) deletion in the mtrR promoter region. CONCLUSIONS: This verified treatment failure occurred in a patient infected with an MLST ST1901/NG-MAST ST1407 strain of N. gonorrhoeae. While this international strain commonly shows resistance or decreased susceptibility to multiple antimicrobials, including extended-spectrum cephalosporins, the strain reported here remained fully susceptible to the latter antimicrobials. Hence, two subtypes of azithromycin-resistant gonococcal MLST ST1901/NG-MAST ST1407 appear to have evolved and to be circulating in Japan. Azithromycin should not be recommended as a single antimicrobial for first-line empirical treatment of gonorrhoea.",T Morita-Ishihara and M Unemo and K I Furubayashi and T Kawahata and K Shimuta and S I Nakayama and M Ohnishi,"1460-2091

This report describes the results of the Canadian Nosocomial Infection Surveillance Program (CNISP) for carbapenem resistant isolates. Methods: From September 2010 to August 31, 2011, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and A. baumannii isolates were submitted to the National Microbiology Laboratory. A detailed patient questionnaire was administered collecting risk factors and outcome data. PCR was used to identify carbapenemase-producing isolates. Antimicrobial susceptibility was conducted using Vitek2. PFGE was conducted to determine strain relatedness. Results: A total of 141 isolates meeting the definition were identified from 11 different hospital sites. Seventy-eight cases were infections, 32 were colonizations, 19 were unknown, and the remainders were not reported. Of the infections, 35{\%} were urinary tract, 27{\%} were skin/soft tissue, and 10{\%} were from blood. Forty four isolates harboured carbapenemases: Enterobacter spp. (4 KPC); Klebsiella spp. (21 KPC, 8 NDM); E. coli (1 GES, 1 KPC); Serratia spp. (6 KPC, 1 GES); Morganella spp. (1 NDM); A. baumannii (1 OXA-23). Several outbreaks were observed based on PFGE analysis including one KPC in Quebec, and two in Ontario involving NDM and KPC. Previous travel history was linked to 10 cases. Two NDM cases sought medical attention in India and one A. baumannii case was from a military source serving overseas.

14631,YES,Murray2010,Article,"BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus aureus infections complicate care of combat-related injuries and can independently result in skin and soft-tissue infections during deployments or training. Community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) strains seem to produce severe disease but retain susceptibility to many oral antimicrobials. This study characterizes 84 MRSA isolates recovered from wound cultures at a combat support hospital in Iraq. METHODS: MRSA strains recovered from December 2007 through March 2009 were analyzed. Antimicrobial resistance testing was determined by broth microdilution and the BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System. The genotypic pattern was analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and polymerase chain reaction identification of resistance and virulence genes. RESULTS: No MRSA isolates from wound cultures were resistant to vancomycin. The most active oral antistaphylococcal agents were tetracycline (95{\%} susceptibility), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (94{\%}), and clindamycin (94{\%}). Of agents not typically recommended as monotherapy, 98{\%} of isolates were susceptible to rifampin, 91{\%} to moxifloxacin, and 60{\%} to levofloxacin. The most common pulsed-field type (PFT) was USA300 (79{\%}). The typical staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec IV elements carrying the CA-MRSA resistance genes were present in 88{\%} of the isolates. Panton-Valentine leukocidin virulence genes were identified in 88{\%} of isolates, including 100{\%} of PFT USA300. The virulence gene associated with an arginine catabolic mobile element was present in 75{\%} of isolates, including 94{\%} of PFT USA300. CONCLUSION: This study is the first genotypic and phenotypic characterization of CA-MRSA recovered from wound cultures in a deployed combat hospital.

A new group of class A beta-lactamases, known as KPC-type carbapenemases, has recently been described and poses a serious clinical challenge. METHODS: Seven patients with bloodstream infections caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates with decreased susceptibility to carbapenems were identified between January and April 2005 in the intensive care units of a hospital in Manhattan. Isolate identification and susceptibility testing were performed according to National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards methodology. All isolates were ribotyped and screened for (bla)KPC by polymerase chain reaction. The polymerase chain reaction product underwent nucleotide sequencing for one of the isolates. Medical records were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: Six isolates were carbapenem-resistant with minimum inhibitory concentrations for imipenem of {\textgreater}8microg/mL. Ribotyping showed that all isolates belonged to a single clone. All isolates possessed (bla)KPC and nucleotide sequencing identified the allelic type KPC-2. Patients' median age was 68 years. The median duration of hospitalization was 25.5 days before the first positive blood culture. Five of 6 patients received previous broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics but none received prior carbapenems. Five of 6 isolates were susceptible to polymyxin B. Three of the 5 patients were treated with polymyxin B and 1 survived. Overall, only 2 of the 6 patients survived.

We used an integrated in vivo-in vitro approach to assess the presence of artemisinin resistance in western Cambodia. This article provides additional data from a clinical trial that has been published in The New England Journal of Medicine. METHODS: Ninety-four adult patients from Battambang Province, western Cambodia, who presented with uncomplicated falciparum malaria were randomized to receive high-dose artesunate therapy (4 mg/kg/day orally for 7 days) or quinine-tetracycline. Plasma concentrations of dihydroartemisinin, in vitro drug susceptibility, and molecular markers were analyzed. Cases meeting all the following criteria were classified as artemisinin resistant: failure to clear parasites within 7 days of treatment or reemergence of parasites within 28 days of follow-up; adequate plasma concentrations of dihydroartemisinin; prolonged parasite clearance; and increased in vitro drug susceptibility levels for dihydroartemisinin. RESULTS: Two (3.3{\%}) of 60 artesunate-treated patients were classified as artemisinin resistant. Their parasite clearance times were prolonged (133 and 95 h, compared with a median of 52.2 h in patients who were cured). These patients had 50{\%} inhibitory concentrations of dihydroartemisinin that were almost 10 times higher than the reference clone W2. Resistance did not appear to be mediated by the pfmdr1 copy number or selected PfATPase6 polymorphisms previously proposed to confer artemisinin resistance. CONCLUSION: Artemisinin resistance has emerged along the Thai-Cambodian border.

A high rate of resistance to different antibiotics has been associated with virulent clonal complex 17 isolates carrying the esp and hyl genes and the purK1 allele. RESULTS: Twelve clinical vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) isolates were obtained from pediatric patients at the Hospital Infantil de Mexico Federico Gomez (HIMFG). Among these VREF isolates, 58.3{\%} (7/12) were recovered from urine, while 41.7{\%} (5/12) were recovered from the bloodstream. The VREF isolates showed a 100{\%} rate of resistance to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, gentamicin, rifampicin, erythromycin and teicoplanin. In addition, 16.7{\%} (2/12) of the isolates were resistant to linezolid, and 66.7{\%} (8/12) were resistant to tetracycline and doxycycline. PCR analysis revealed the presence of the vanA gene in all 12 VREF isolates, esp in 83.3{\%} (10/12) of the isolates and hyl in 50{\%} (6/12) of the isolates. Phylogenetic analysis via molecular typing was performed using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and demonstrated 44{\%} similarity among the VREF isolates. MLST analysis identified four different sequence types (ST412, ST757, ST203 and ST612). CONCLUSION: This study provides the first report of multidrug-resistant VREF isolates belonging to clonal complex 17 from a tertiary care center in Mexico City. Multidrug resistance and genetic determinants of virulence confer advantages among VREF in the colonization of their host. Therefore, the prevention and control of the spread of nosocomial infections caused by VREF is crucial for identifying new emergent subclones that could be challenging to treat in subsequent years.",S A Ochoa and G Escalona and A Cruz-Cordova and L B Davila and Z Saldana and V Cazares-Domimguez and C A Eslava and B Lopez-Martinez and R Hernandez-Castro and G Aquino-Jarquin and J Xicohtencatl-Cortes,1471-2180,BMC Microbiol,"*Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial,Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology,Blood/microbiology,Cross Infection/epidemiology/microbiology,DNA, Bacterial/genetics,Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field,Enterococcus faecium/*classification/drug effects/,Genes, Bacterial,Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections/*epidemiology/*,Hospitals, Pediatric,Humans,Mexico/epidemiology,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Molecular Epidemiology,Multilocus Sequence Typing,Phylogeny,Polymerase Chain Reaction,Tertiary Care Centers,Urine/microbiology,purification",291,{Molecular analysis and distribution of multidrug-resistant Enterococcus faecium isolates belonging to clonal complex 17 in a tertiary care center in Mexico City},NA,13,2013,NA,"1471-2180

In this study, acquisition of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Salmonella spp. in 2013 Hajj pilgrims from Marseille, France, was investigated. In total, 267 rectal swabs were collected from 129 participants before their departure and after their return from the pilgrimage as well as during the pilgrimage from patients with diarrhoea. Samples were screened for the presence of Salmonella using quantitative real-time PCR and culture. Whole-genome sequencing was performed to characterise one of the isolates, and the mechanism leading to colistin resistance was investigated. Six post-Hajj samples and one sample collected during a diarrhoea episode in Hajj were positive for Salmonella by real-time PCR, with five Salmonella enterica belonging to several serotypes recovered by culture, whereas no pre-Hajj sample was positive. Two of the isolates belonged to the epidemic Newport serotype, were resistant to cephalosporins, gentamicin and colistin, and harboured the bla(CTX-M-2) gene and a 12-nucleotide deletion in the pmrB gene leading to colistin resistance. This study shows that pilgrims acquired Salmonella bacteria, including a novel MDR clone, during the Hajj pilgrimage. This calls for more improved public health surveillance during Hajj because Salmonella is one of the most common diarrhoea-causing bacteria worldwide. Therefore, returning pilgrims could disseminate MDR bacteria worldwide upon returning to their home countries.",A O Olaitan and N M Dia and P Gautret and S Benkouiten and K Belhouchat and T Drali and P Parola and P Brouqui and Z Memish and D Raoult and J M Rolain,"1872-7913

15547,MAYBE,Oneko2015,Article,"BACKGROUND: Nontyphoidal Salmonella (NTS), mainly serotypes Typhimurium and Enteritidis, cause invasive infections with high mortality in children in sub-Saharan Africa. Multidrug resistance is common, and resistance to third-generation cephalosporins has emerged. METHODS: We reviewed clinical features, outcomes, and antimicrobial resistance patterns in invasive NTS infections among children aged 6 weeks to 5 years participating in malaria vaccine studies in an area of high malaria and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission in Siaya, western Kenya. Blood culture was performed in hospitalized children and pediatric outpatients with prolonged fever. RESULTS: From July 2009 to December 2013, 1696 children aged 6 weeks to 17 months were enrolled into vaccine trials and followed for up to 53 months. We obtained 1692 blood cultures from 847 children. Of 134 bacterial pathogens isolated, 102 (76.1{\%}) were Salmonella serogroup B or D. Invasive NTS disease occurred in 94 (5.5{\%}) children, with an incidence of 1870, 4134, and 6510 episodes per 100 000 person-years overall, in infants, and in HIV-infected children, respectively. Malaria infection within the past 2 weeks occurred in 18.8{\%} (3/16) of invasive NTS episodes in HIV-infected and 66.2{\%} (53/80) in HIV-uninfected children. Case fatality rate was 3.1{\%}. Salmonella group B resistant to ceftriaxone emerged in 2009 and 2010 (6.2{\%} [2/32 isolates]), rising to 56.5{\%} (13/23 isolates) in 2012 and 2013. CONCLUSIONS: Incidence of invasive NTS disease was high in this area of high malaria and HIV transmission, especially in HIV-infected children.

15604,MAYBE,Orlovic2009,Article,"Background: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has been an important nosocomial pathogen worldwide for more than four decades. Community-acquired MRSA infections, generally occurring in previously healthy persons without recognizable risk factors for health care setting-related MRSA, are emerging as serious clinical and public health concerns. The most frequent of these community-based infections include skin and soft tissue infections and necrotizing pneumonias. A majority of causative communityacquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) isolates are associated with genes that encode the virulence factor, Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) toxin. Aims {\&} Objectives: To describe six cases of CA-MRSA pneumonia recently admitted to our community hospital in Florida, and discuss the epidemiology, clinical features, and management of these expanding infections. Methods/Study Design: The medical records of six patients with radiographically-confirmed pneumonia and positive sputum cultures for MRSA at the time of hospitalization at the Lawnwood Regional Medical Center and Heart Institute, Fort Pierce, Florida, from December 2006 through January 2007, were retrospectively reviewed. All patients were seen by one of the authors (DO), an infectious diseases consultant. Lawnwood Regional Medical Center is a 341-bed, acute care institution and regional referral center for four counties of Treasure Coast, FL. The hospital institution review board gave permission for this study. Results/Findings: Six patients (5 men, 1 woman) with CA-MRSA pneumonia were identified. The mean patient age was 57 years (range, 32-79 years). Three patients had no history of previous hospital admission, while two patients had been last hospitalized two years prior to the study admission. Three elderly patients had known co-morbidities predisposing to pneumonia including carcinoma of the lung (2 patients), and cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, COPD, and cardiomyopathy (1 patient each). Sputum samples were collected at the time of admission and all grew MRSA. Two isolates were resistant only to oxacillin, while four were also resistant to levofloxacin (3 isolates), erythromycin (2 isolates), ciprofloxacin (1 isolate), and/or clindamycin (1 isolate). One patient had concurrent Pseudomonas bacteremia, and another had Pseudomonas isolated from sputum culture in addition to MRSA. All patients had abnormal chest radiographs; three had focal unilateral pneumonia, two had bilateral pneumonia, and one had a lung abscess. The latter patient also had evidence of metastatic infection with sternoclavicular osteomyelitis. Three patients required ventilatory support; two of these subjects died and one was discharged to hospice care. None of the six patients had any epidemiologic connection to one another. Conclusion: CA-MRSA is becoming an increasingly important cause of communityacquired pneumonia in many parts of the world, and in these regions empiric antibiotic treatment guidelines should be reconsidered. {\textcopyright} 2009 Orlovic, D. {\&} Smego, R.A.",D Orlovic and R A Smego,1840-4529,International Journal of Collaborative Research on Internal Medicine and Public Health,"Pseudomonas,Pseudomonas aeruginosa,Pseudomonas pneumonia,United States,adult,aged,antibiotic resistance,article,aztreonam,cardiomyopathy,chronic kidney failure,chronic obstructive lung disease,ciprofloxacin,clindamycin,clinical article,clinical feature,community acquired pneumonia,community hospital,comorbidity,controlled study,diabetes mellitus,erythromycin,female,human,infection,levofloxacin,linezolid,liver cirrhosis,lung abscess,lung carcinoma,male,methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus,methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus infect,nonhuman,osteomyelitis,oxacillin,sputum culture,thorax radiography,tigecycline,vancomycin",73--82,{Emerging community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L358844024 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=18404529{\&}id=doi:{\&}atitle=Emerging+community-acquired+methicillin-resistant+Staphylococcus+aureus+pneumonia{\&}sti,1,2009,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,MAYBE,Jake,NO,Zach,Ayomide,Zach_3,yes,,
15625,MAYBE,Oshun2012,Article,"Objective: Carbapenem use is still low in Nigeria because they are expensive, not readily available and are reserved for life threatening gram negative infections. While carbapenem resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae is increasingly reported worldwide, there is limited data from Africa. The Lagos University Teaching hospital is a 761 bed referral hospital with an inpatient population of about 11 000 annually. Klebsiella pneumoniae has been identified as a major health care associated pathogen with reports of increasing resistance to various antibiotics. This study was undertaken to identify the risk factors for infection with carbapenem resistant K. pneumoniae (CRKP). Methods: The study was conducted over a 6 month period and all inpatients with microbiological confirmation of carbapenem resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae infection were recruited as cases. Controls were in-patients with carbapenem susceptible Klebsiella pneumoniae infections. Carbapenem resistance was determined using disc diffusion tests and carbapenemase production was confirmed using the modified Hodge test. Patient data as well as data on antibiotic use and hospital stay were collected using a simple questionnaire. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were carried out to determine the association between potential risk factors and carbapenem resistance. Results: Klebsiella pneumoniae was isolated from 153 in-patients of which eight were carbapenem resistant. Bivariate analysis showed that the use of three or more antibiotics (p = 0.03) and previous hospital admission (p = 0.05) were associated with CRKP infections. The use of three or more antibiotics (odds ratio [OR], 9.0 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.12-90.25) was an independent risk factor for the development of CRKP infections using multivariate analysis. Only four out of the eight CRKP isolates could be identified by the modified Hodge test (MHT) as carbapenemase producers. Resistance rates to other commonly used antibiotics were {\textgreater} 50{\%} except for amikacin to which resistance rate was 25{\%}. Conclusion: Infections with CRKP are an emerging clinical threat and these findings highlight the need to institute antibiotic stewardship to promote rational antibiotic use as well as good infection control programmes to limit their transmission within the hospital.",P Oshun and F Ogunsola,1198-743X,Clinical Microbiology and Infection,"Africa,Gram negative infection,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Klebsiella pneumoniae infection,Nigeria,amikacin,antibiotic agent,bivariate analysis,carbapenem,carbapenemase,confidence interval,disk diffusion,health care,hospital,hospital admission,hospital patient,hospitalization,human,infection,infection control,microbiology,multivariate analysis,pathogenesis,patient,patient coding,population,questionnaire,risk,risk factor,teaching hospital,university",765,"{Carbapenem resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae at the Lagos University teaching hospital, Lagos, Nigeria}",http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L70824283 http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-0691.2012.03802.x http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=1198743X{\&}id=doi:10.1111{\%}2Fj.1469-0691.2012.03802.x{\&}atitle=C,18,2012,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,MAYBE,Cale,MAYBE,Zach,Zach,Zach_3,no,could not find full-text,
15650,MAYBE,Otsuka2006,Article,"During a 53-month period (March 1994 to August 1998), 48 Corynebacterium striatum isolates recovered from clinical specimens were characterized. The organisms were identified by both phenotypic characteristics and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Thirty-six (75{\%}) were isolated from sputum/bronchial aspirates, 10 (21{\%}) from wound exudates/pus, 1 (2{\%}) from vaginal discharge, and 1 (2{\%}) from an otorrheic specimen. All 48 patients had been hospitalized for treatment of an underlying disease and had received antibiotics previously. The C. striatum isolates were considered pathogenic based on their abundance within polymorphonuclear neutrophils and their dominant growth in culture. Sensitivities of isolates to 11 antibiotics were determined by broth microdilution. MIC90 values of the isolates were 1 microg/mL for vancomycin, 16 microg/mL for penicillin and ampicillin, 32 microg/mL for minocycline, and {\textgreater} or = 32 microg/mL for cephalosporins, imipenem, ofloxacin, and macrolides. Restriction fragment-length polymorphism analysis with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was used to determine the clonal identity. The pulse-field gel electrophoresis profiles revealed 14 distinct patterns with 20 subtypes. The isolates for the nosocomial outbreaks of C. striatum included 3 types (A, D, and E) with 4 subtypes (A1, A2, D2, and E). All 4 genotypes had broad-spectrum resistance to antimicrobial agents. Furthermore, type E strain isolated from 3 patients in the same ward was sensitive only to vancomycin.

15757,MAYBE,Paget2014,Article,"New Delhi metallo-$\beta$-lactamase-1 is a recently described gene that codes for carbapenem resistance. Inherently transferable between Gram-negative bacteria on a plasmid that also confers extended antibiotic resistance, it represents a potentially serious problem for susceptible patients, such as burn victims, and is spreading globally at a rapid rate. The authors present a case of a septic burn patient returning from India, whose microbiological cultures grew bacteria expressing New Delhi metallo-$\beta$-lactamase-1. His TBSA was 14{\%}. His length of stay as an inpatient was 95 days. This is the first case report of this resistance strain from a U.K. burns unit. Isolation, barrier nursing and the use of hydrogen peroxide vapor decontamination proved effective in limiting transmission and spread.

We also describe the molecular characteristics of PVL-MRSA and antibiotic resistance phenotypes. A total of 55,760 specimens were screened for MRSA between April 2008 and December 2010. MRSA was identified in 1,998 specimens, and ciprofloxacin-susceptible (CSMRSA) isolates (385/1,998, or 19.3{\%}) were subjected to PVL testing. Of these, 70 (18.1{\%}) were identified as PVL-CSMRSA. During the study period, the MRSA colonization rate decreased from 4.6{\%} to 2.8{\%}. In contrast, the colonization rate of PVL-CSMRSA increased over time, rising from 0.075{\%} in 2008 and 0.07{\%} in 2009 to 0.22{\%} in 2010. The mean patient age was 52 years (range, 18 to 90 years); over two-thirds were male. Seven different lineages of PVL-CSMRSA were identified. Over the 3 years, the Southwest Pacific clone (CC30) was dominant in our population. The CC5 clone was detected once in 2008 and not at all in 2009 but accounted for a third of all PVL-CSMRSA strains in 2010. This lineage was commonly associated with clindamycin resistance and, less frequently, tetracycline resistance. We conclude that there is hitherto unrecognized low-level carriage of PVL-CSMRSA among patients being admitted to hospitals in northwest London.

S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus isolated from blood cultures of inpatients, attended at a teaching hospital, were analyzed for the presence of the mecA gene and by SCCmec typing. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of tigecycline, linezolid, daptomycin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, and vancomycin were determined. Isolates exhibiting vancomycin MICs of ≥2 $\mu$g/ml were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The rate of mecA positivity was 92.9{\%} and 100{\%} in S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus, respectively. The most frequent SCCmec types were type III (53.2{\%}) in S. epidermidis and type I (32.1{\%}) in S. haemolyticus. All isolates were susceptible to linezolid and daptomycin, but 7.1{\%} of S. haemolyticus and 2.3{\%} of S. epidermidis isolates were resistant to tigecycline, and 1.2{\%} each of S. haemolyticus and S. epidermidis were resistant and intermediately resistant to quinupristin/dalfopristin, respectively. S. epidermidis exhibited higher vancomycin MICs (40{\%} with MIC of ≥2 $\mu$g/ml). Clonal typing of strains with vancomycin MIC of ≥2 $\mu$g/ml revealed the presence of different PFGE types of S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus over a period of up to 4 years (2002-2004, 2005-2008, 2006-2009, 2010-2011). Despite the observation of a high prevalence of mecA, the clinical strains were fully susceptible to vancomycin and to the new drugs linezolid, daptomycin, tigecycline, and quinupristin/dalfopristin.

METHODS: PCR and sequencing were used to search for beta-lactamase genes. Clonal relationships between the isolates were analysed by multilocus sequence typing and PFGE. RESULTS: A history of prior hospitalization in the same ward was determined for two of the three patients. The three isolates of K. pneumoniae belonged to the same sequence type (ST), ST15, and were clonally related. All three isolates carried the bla(NDM-1) gene and co-expressed the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases CTX-M-15 and SHV-5, as well as the narrow-spectrum beta-lactamases SHV-1, OXA-1, OXA-9 and TEM-1.

Several such enzymes have been described since the 1990s. In the present study, a novel acquired MBL, named FIM-1, was identified and characterized. The bla(FIM-1) gene was cloned from a multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolate (FI-14/157) cultured from a patient with a vascular graft infection in Florence, Italy. The isolate belonged in the sequence type 235 epidemic clonal lineage. The FIM-1 enzyme is a member of subclass B1 and, among acquired MBLs, exhibited the highest similarity (ca. 40{\%} amino acid identity) with NDM-type enzymes. In P. aeruginosa FI-14/157, the bla(FIM-1) gene was apparently inserted into the chromosome and associated with ISCR19-like elements that were likely involved in the capture and mobilization of this MBL gene. Transfer experiments of the bla(FIM-1) gene to an Escherichia coli strain or another P. aeruginosa strain by conjugation or electrotransformation were not successful. The FIM-1 protein was produced in E. coli and purified by two chromatography steps. Analysis of the kinetic parameters, carried out with the purified enzyme, revealed that FIM-1 has a broad substrate specificity, with a preference for penicillins (except the 6alpha-methoxy derivative temocillin) and carbapenems. Aztreonam was not hydrolyzed. Detection of this novel type of acquired MBL in a P. aeruginosa clinical isolate underscores the increasing diversity of such enzymes that can be encountered in the clinical setting.",S Pollini and S Maradei and P Pecile and G Olivo and F Luzzaro and J D Docquier and G M Rossolini,"0066-4804

16946,YES,Principe2017,Article,"Objectives NDM-producing Enterobacteriaceae are considered emergent on the African continent and have been increasingly reported in recent years. In contrast, strains producing NDM-type enzymes have been rarely reported in Italy, usually associated with sporadic cases or small outbreaks. Here we report two cases of infection caused by NDM-1-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (NDM-KP) in two unrelated patients returned from travel to Egypt. Case reports The two patients had been previously hospitalised for a short period in two different Egyptian hospitals. In our institution in Italy, NDM-KP isolates were detected from surgical wound drainage (patient {\#}1) and respiratory secretions and blood cultures (patient {\#}2). Rectal swabs of both patients were persistently positive for NDM-KP. In both cases, NDM-1-producing isolates exhibited a multidrug-resistant phenotype, being susceptible only to tigecycline and colistin. Analysis by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) revealed that the two K. pneumoniae isolates were not clonally related, belonging to different sequence types (STs), namely ST15 from patient {\#}1 and ST11 from patient {\#}2. Conclusions To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of NDM-producing isolates imported from Africa to Italy, with no obvious link to the Indian subcontinent. Our experience confirms that Egypt is an emergent source of NDM-producing Enterobacteriaceae, thus representing a cause of concern for Mediterranean countries. Owing to its geographical position, Italy is a first-line European checkpoint with respect to African countries and plays a pivotal role in limiting the dissemination of high-risk clones, especially considering the latest strong migration flows.",L Principe and C Mauri and V Conte and B Pini and T Giani and G M Rossolini and F Luzzaro,"2213-7173

We describe the first detection of A. baumannii carrying the blaNDM-1 gene in Lebanon, isolated from Syrian patients wounded during the civil war. METHODS: Four carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii strains isolated in 2012 in the Tripoli Government Hospital, Lebanon, from civilians wounded during the Syrian war, were analysed. Susceptibility was determined by disk diffusion testing, and resistance to carbapenems was confirmed by Etest. The presence of blaOXA-23-like, blaOXA-24-like, blaOXA-58-like, blaOXA-143-like, and blaNDM was investigated by PCR. Clonal relationships were studied by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and blaOXA-51 sequence-based typing. RESULTS: All isolates harboured the blaNDM-1 gene and were negative for other tested carbapenemases. They all belonged to the sequence type 85 and formed a single cluster by PFGE. Finally, blaOXA-51-like gene sequencing revealed the presence of the blaOXA-94 variant in all four isolates. CONCLUSION: These findings show that Syria constitutes a reservoir for NDM-1-producing bacteria.

The Salmonella isolates were also compared by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. All ESBL-producing strains, but one, carried the bla(CTX-M-15) gene. Moreover, three of four strains that proved to be positive for a bla(TEM) gene were producing a TEM-1 beta-lactamase. Two strains of S.

Method: During a 6-month period, 28 hospitalized burn patients who required to be placed on broad spectrum antibiotics were studied. Isolated species identified by routine biochemical test. Susceptibility testing for these species was performed by recommended the CLSI guidelines method. The tested antibiotics included cefotaxime, cefepime, aztreonam, imipenem, amoxicillin + clavulonic acid, gentamicin, amikacin, tobramycin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and chloramphenicol. For determination of KPC in phenotypical forms, Modified Hodge Test was utilized as per CLSI recommendation. Results: Thirty-five Klebsiella spp. were isolated from 28 hospitalized patients. Nineteen out of 35 Klebsiella isolates were resistant to imipenem and that all of them had positive KPC. Nine of imipenem resistant isolates were also resistant to all tested antibiotics. Mortality rate among patients with positive KPC was 33{\%}. Conclusion: High rate of multi-drug resistant (MDR) strains in isolates with positive KPC is a major challenge in Iran and that it could cause an increase in both mortality and morbidity among burn patients. Thus, appropriate infection control measures and guidelines are needed to prevent such infections among burn patients. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI.",A {Rastegar Lari} and L Azimi and M Rahbar and F Fallah and R Alaghehbandan,"0305-4179

Leprosy is a specific infection: (i) it is a chronic infection primarily affecting the skin and peripheral nerves, (ii) Mycobacterium leprae is one of the last bacterial species of medical interest that cannot be cultured in vitro (mainly because of its reductive genome evolution), and (iii) transmission and pathophysiological data is still limited. The various presentations of the disease (Ridley-Jopling and WHO classifications) are correlated with the patient's immune response, bacillary load, and by the delay before diagnosis. Multidrug therapy (dapsone, rifampicin, with or without clofazimine) has been recommended since 1982 as the standard treatment of leprosy; 6. months for patients presenting with paucibacillary leprosy and 12. months for patients presenting with multibacillary leprosy. The worldwide use of leprosy drugs started in the 1980s and their free access since 1995 contributed to the drastic decline in the number of new case patients.

17712,YES,Rodriguez-Avial2012a,Article,"Nine isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae were isolated from a renal transplant patient suffering from recurrent urosepsis over a period of 4months. Imipenem resistance was detected after imipenem-ertapenem therapy. When treatment was switched to tigecycline the K. pneumoniae developed resistance to tigecycline (MIC=8mg/L). The nine isolates were tested by determination of agar dilution MICs, phenotypic carbapenemase, extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) testing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Polymerase chain reaction and sequencing analysis were employed for identification of bla genes and mapping of the integron carrying the MBL gene. The nine isolates were clonally related and all produced the SHV-12 enzyme. Five MBL-producing isolates showed imipenem MICs ranging from 2 to 64mg/L and all were detected by testing with imipenem and EDTA. The five isolates harboured the blaVIM-1 gene. Three isolates showed increased tigecycline MICs (4-8mg/L). Serial blood cultures obtained on the same day resulted in a VIM-positive/tigecycline-susceptible and a VIM-negative/tigecycline-resistant K. pneumoniae isolate. No isolate developed concurrent imipenem and tigecycline resistance. The patient had a persistent urinary tract infection and recurrent bacteraemia caused by a mixed population of Klebesiella pneumoniae isolates adapting to the selective pressure of antimicrobial therapy at the time. The present study is a worrisome example of what could happen when an immunocompromised host is subjected to the pressures of antimicrobial therapy. In addition, we report the first treatment-emergent MIC increase of tigecycline from 0.5 to 8mg/L in K. pneumoniae. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

17892,MAYBE,Rostoff2010,Article,"We report a case of pacemaker endocarditis due to Stenotrophomonas maltophilia in a 22-year-old Caucasian man with d-transposition of the great arteries after atrial switch procedure. S.maltophilia isolated from blood cultures was susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and amikacin, and resistant to ciprofloxacin and all tested $\beta$-lactam antibiotics. The infected pacemaker system was completely removed by thoracotomy. Simultaneously, a new DDD pacemaker and epicardial electrodes were successfully implanted and selective antibiotic therapy consisting of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (480 mg i.v. q 6 h) and amikacin (250 mg i.v. twice daily) was continued. However, the post-operative course was complicated by septic shock and the patient died on 9th day after surgery. Importantly, S.maltophilia isolated from extracted pacemaker leads was multidrug-resistant including to trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, all tested aminoglycosides, and $\beta$-lactams, with the exception of ticarcillin-clavulanate. In conclusion, pacemaker endocarditis due to Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is an extremely rare but serious complication of permanent pacing therapy. The susceptibility of S.maltophilia isolates to antimicrobial agents can change during the course of infection. Despite the inherent resistance of S.maltophilia to most $\beta$-lactam antibiotics, multidrug-resistant strains may be susceptible in vitro to ticarcillin-clavulanate. Further studies are needed to determine the optimal management of patients with pacemaker endocarditis caused by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",P Rostoff and A Paradowski and A Gackowski and E Konduracka and N {El Massri} and G Gajos and R Pfitzner and R Drwila and J Sadowski and W Piwowarska,0167-5273,Int J Cardiol,",*Stenotrophomonas maltophilia,Artificial/*microbiology,Bacterial/*diagnosis/therapy,Endocarditis,Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections/*diagnosis/ther,Humans,Male,Pacemaker,Prosthesis-Related Infections/*diagnosis/therapy,Stenotrophomonas maltophilia,Transposition of Great Vessels/*surgery,Young Adult,adult,amikacin,amoxicillin,antibiotic therapy,article,bacterial endocarditis,bacterium isolation,beta lactam antibiotic,blood culture,case report,ciprofloxacin,cotrimoxazole,death,great vessels transposition,heart atrium pacemaker,human,in vitro study,male,nonhuman,postoperative period,priority journal,septic shock,thoracotomy,vancomycin",e92--e95,{Stenotrophomonas maltophilia pacemaker endocarditis in a patient with d-transposition of the great arteries after atrial switch procedure},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L360124499 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcard.2008.12.164 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=01675273{\&}id=doi:10.1016{\%}2Fj.ijcard.2008.12.164{\&}atitle=Stenotro,145,2010,3,"From Duplicate 2 (Stenotrophomonas maltophilia pacemaker endocarditis in a patient with d-transposition of the great arteries after atrial switch procedure - Rostoff, P; Paradowski, A; Gackowski, A; Konduracka, E; El Massri, N; Gajos, G; Pfitzner, R; Drwila, R; Sadowski, J; Piwowarska, W)

METHODS: A previously healthy 47-year-old woman presented with left eye purulent discharge and irritation beginning 3 months earlier. The patient had previously been treated with bacitracin and olopatadine without improvement. Bacterial staining, culture, and antibiotic sensitivities were performed from a conjunctival swab. RESULTS: The cultures revealed heavy growth of A. xylosoxidans. The organism was resistant to aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, and cephalosporins. The patient was started on polytrim, but an allergic reaction forced the use of topical Timentin 2{\%}. After 14 days of treatment, the infection completely resolved. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first case report of an external ocular infection caused by A. xylosoxidans in a host without predisposing risk factors and the first case report of isolated conjunctivitis caused by A. xylosoxidans. A. xylosoxidans should be considered a rare but potential pathogen capable of producing chronic conjunctivitis in an otherwise healthy host.",R Rush and M Friedlander,"0277-3740 (Print)

Seven different serotypes (14, 9V, 23F, 19F, 6B, 19A, and 6A, in order of descending frequency), seven alleles of the murM gene (murMA, murMB6, and the new murMB12 to -16 alleles), and 31 multilocus sequence types (STs) were observed. The vast majority of the PNSP isolates (90.7{\%}) belonged to the international multiresistant clones, and among these, the Spain(9V)-ST156 clonal complex was the most prevalent (56 isolates) and was significantly overrepresented in invasive infections. The clone has been evolving rapidly, as demonstrated by the observed number of STs, the diversity in multiple-locus variable-number-tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA) types, and the polymorphism of pbp and pspA genes (coding for penicillin-binding proteins and the pneumococcal surface protein A, respectively). The presence and structure of the rlrA islet (encoding the pneumococcal pilus) were very well conserved.

The patient was first colonized by an epidemic ampicillin-resistant E. faecium (ARE)-ST117 clustering into lineage 78. This clone exhibited resistance to levofloxacin, erythromycin and high-level resistance to streptomycin and gentamicin. After receiving treatment with several broad spectrum antibiotics for febrile neutropenia, a 9-day course of oral linezolid was administered once the patient developed bacteraemia by the same ARE colonizing clone. Linezolid-resistant ARE was detected 17 days later in the follow-up fecal samples and persisted 41 days after suppression of linezolid therapy. Resistance to linezolid was associated with G2576T transversion in the 23S rRNA and the presence of cfr gene was not detected.

The exact national scenario of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is not known in India owing to the absence of a central monitoring agency. Aims: The aim of this study is to identify the group of organisms developing resistance, to know the classes of drugs against, which resistance has emerged and to assess the possible factors that can favor the development of AMR so that antibiotic policy can be formulated for the proper and effective use of antibiotics. Settings and Design: An observational study was conducted for a period of 1 year from August 2011 to July 2012 in a tertiary care hospital in Pondicherry. Subjects and Methods: Data regarding culture and sensitivity of the organisms isolated from different sources such as urine, blood, wound swab/pus, stool, sputum and tracheal aspirations were collected from the records of the Microbiology Department. Sample processing, identification of organisms to the genus and/or species level and antimicrobial sensitivity were carried out as per the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines on the 999 samples received. Results: Out of 999 samples, 125 (12.5{\%}) showed significant growth of organisms exhibiting resistance to either single or multiple drugs. Out of 84 (67.2{\%}) in-patients and 41 (32.8{\%}) out-patient samples, Escherichia was the most common organism isolated with a total of 41 (32.8{\%}), followed by Methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, 26 (20.8{\%}), Klebsiella 25 (20{\%}), Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus 17 (13.6{\%}), Pseudomonas 10 (8{\%}), Proteus 2 (1.6{\%}), 1 (0.8{\%}) each of Citrobacter and Enterococci. Maximum resistance was observed with commonly used first line antimicrobials such as co-trimoxazole, ampicillin, amoxicillin, amoxyclav, fluoroquinolones, third generation cephalosporins and nalidixic acid. Least resistant or highly sensitive were amikacin, nitrofurantoin, gentamycin and doxycycline among the gram-negative bacteria. Macrolides, clindamycin, gentamycin, nitrofurantoin, vancomycin were the most sensitive antimicrobials against the gram-positive bacteria. Lack of knowledge on the consequences of inappropriate use of antibiotics was exhibited by 63{\%} of subjects in our study. Conclusions: AMR was more with hospital acquired organisms and against commonly used antibiotics that are available since long period. Variation of resistance and sensitivity pattern with time and geographical location is identified.

18726,YES,Scott2007b,Article,"BACKGROUND: We investigated an outbreak of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex infection among US service members injured in Iraq. METHODS: The investigation was conducted in Iraq and Kuwait, in the 2 military hospitals where the majority of injured service members were initially treated. After initially characterizing the outbreak, we evaluated 3 potential sources of infection for the period March 2003 to December 2004. The evaluation included screening samples that were obtained from the skin of patients for the presence of colonization and assessing the soil and health care environments for the presence of A. baumanii-calcoaceticus complex organisms. Isolates obtained from samples from patients in US Military treatment facilities, as well as environmental isolates, were genotypically characterized and compared using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: A. baumanii-calcoaceticus complex organisms were present on the skin in only 1 (0.6{\%}) of 160 patients who were screened and in 1 (2{\%}) of 49 soil samples. A. baumanii-calcoaceticus complex isolates were recovered from treatment areas in 7 of the 7 field hospitals sampled. Using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, we identified 5 cluster groups in which isolates from patients were related to environmental isolates. One cluster included hospitalized patients who had not been deployed to Iraq. Among the clinical isolates, only imipenem, polymyxin B, and colistin demonstrated reliable in vitro antimicrobial activity. Generally, the environmental isolates were more drug susceptible than were the clinical isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that environmental contamination of field hospitals and infection transmission within health care facilities played a major role in this outbreak. On the basis of these findings, maintaining infection control throughout the military health care system is essential. Novel strategies may be required to prevent the transmission of pathogens in combat field hospitals.",P Scott and G Deye and A Srinivasan and C Murray and K Moran and E Hulten and J Fishbain and D Craft and S Riddell and L Lindler and J Mancuso and E Milstrey and C T Bautista and J Patel and A Ewell and T Hamilton and C Gaddy and M Tenney and G Christopher and K Petersen and T Endy and B Petruccelli,1058-4838,Clin Infect Dis,"*Disease Outbreaks,*Equipment Contamination,Acinetobacter Infections/drug therapy/*epidemiolog,Acinetobacter baumannii/*drug effects/genetics/pat,Acinetobacter calcoaceticus/*drug effects/genetics,Adult,Cross Infection/epidemiology/*microbiology/transmi,Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial/*drug effects,Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field,Environmental Exposure,Female,Hospitals, Military,Humans,Infection Control/methods,Iraq/epidemiology,Kuwait/epidemiology,Male,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Military Personnel,Molecular Epidemiology,Phylogeny,United States",1577--1584,{An outbreak of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex infection in the US military health care system associated with military operations in Iraq},NA,44,2007,12,"1537-6591

18833,MAYBE,Senok2007,Article,"BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae represent key aetiological agents in respiratory tract infections showing an increasing trend of antimicrobial resistance. We present the first report on the antimicrobial resistance in S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae isolated from patients in the United Arab Emirates. METHODS: One hundred S. pneumoniae and 102 H. influenzae strains were isolated from patients with community acquired respiratory tract infections during the study period (October 2004-March 2006). Susceptibility testing to a panel of antibiotics was conducted using disc diffusion and E test. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were interpreted using CLSI and Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) breakpoints. RESULTS: For S. pneumoniae isolates, 57{\%} were penicillin susceptible while 98{\%} were susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanate with both interpretative criteria. Cefaclor was the least effective cephalosporin with only 57{\%} and 43{\%} of isolates showing susceptibility with CLSI and PK/PD breakpoints respectively. Thirty-six isolates were ofloxacin non-susceptible (intermediate and resistant); three resistant isolates were associated with high ciprofloxacin MICs ({\textgreater}8 mg/L). There was elevated macrolide resistance with associated high levels of erythromycin/clindamycin cross-resistance (n=22/30) suggesting predominant erm(B)-mediated resistance and 21{\%} of isolates demonstrated multidrug resistance. For H. influenzae, 18{\%} were beta-lactamase producers. Reduction in cefaclor and cefprozil susceptibility with PK/PD breakpoints (94.1{\%} to 41.2{\%} and 62.7{\%} respectively) was seen and only 1{\%} remained azithromycin and clarithomycin susceptible. For both pathogens, lowest susceptibility was with co-trimoxazole. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate a high level of penicillin resistance and continued usefulness of amoxicillin/clavulanate. Elevated macrolide and fluoroquinolone resistance and the occurrence of multidrug resistance indicate a need for continued surveillance.",A Senok and M Al-Zarouni and J Al-Najjar and A Nublusi and D Panigrahi,1972-2680,J Infect Dev Ctries,"*Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial,Community-Acquired Infections/epidemiology/microbi,Haemophilus Infections/epidemiology/*microbiology,Haemophilus influenzae/*drug effects,Humans,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Penicillin Resistance,Pneumococcal Infections/epidemiology/*microbiology,Population Surveillance,Prevalence,Respiratory Tract Infections/epidemiology/microbio,Streptococcus pneumoniae/*drug effects,United Arab Emirates/epidemiology",296--302,{Antimicrobial resistance among Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae isolates in the United Arab Emirates: 2004-2006},NA,1,2007,3,"1972-2680

Thirteen of these 21 patients (62{\%}) had received linezolid during the 3 months preceding S. epidermidis recovery. Two closely related pulsotypes (P1a and P1b) were identified among the 27 studied isolates that belonged to the sequence type ST2 and harboured the mecA gene and the SCCmecIII type. The strains recovered from patients 1-4 (pulsotype P1a) showed the nucleotide mutation G2474T inside the amplified fragment of the 23S rRNA region and carried the aac(6')-Ie-aph(2'')-Ia, ant(4'), and catA genes, whereas the strains from patients 5-21 (pulsotype P1b) showed the mutation G2603T and carried the aac(6')-Ie-aph(2'')-Ia gene. None of the strains amplified the cfr gene. The ica gene and the IS256 element were detected in all strains. The emergence of 2 closely related methicillin- and linezolid-resistant S. epidermidis strains with 2 different mutations in the 23S rRNA region (G2474T and G2603T) is reported in this study as a cause of a nosocomial outbreak. The presence of G2474T or G2603T point mutations suggests that there are multiple potential sites within domain V of the 23S rRNA region at which mutations could confer resistance to linezolid in the clinical isolates.

18911,MAYBE,Sgambati2011,Article,"Colistin (COL) is an important antibiotic for treatment of multi-drug resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa in CF airway infection. Chronic treatment with inhaled COL has led to the development of COL-resistant P. aeruginosa (CRPA) strains at some European CF centers, and patient-topatient transmission has been reported at two such centers. The objective of this study was to assess retrospectively the prevalence and molecular epidemiology of CRPA in the U.S., in light of data indicating that chronic inhaled COL use here is more prevalent than generally recognized. As part of this study, ∼1100 isolates referred from U.S. CF centers to the CF Synergy Lab (Columbia University) as MDR P. aeruginosa and initially tested as resistant or intermediate to COL during 2000 - 2007 were transferred to a research repository, re-coded, re-speciated and re-tested; ∼410 isolates were confirmed as CRPA. A limited data set that links isolate codes to specimen receipt dates and patient, center, and region codes enabled analysis of temporal trends and geographic relationships without revealing patient or center identities. Overall, 57 U.S. CF patients had ≥2 CRPA isolates, and 14 had ≥4 isolates. Sixteen U.S. centers were identified at which at least three patients had had at least one CRPA isolate cultured. Our analysis focused on three centers, each with a relatively large number of CRPA isolates: Center J, with 20 isolates collected from 15 patients; Center M, with 12 isolates from 10 patients; and Center N, with 13 isolates from 9 patients. About half of these isolates were highly COL resistant (MIC {\textgreater} 1024 mg/L, or 128-fold above the current CLSI-defined lower limit of resistance). The phoPQ parRS, and pmrAB loci encode two-component systems (TCS) that regulate COL resistance mechanisms; mutations in these loci can lead to resistance. To understand the nature of such mutations in this set of 48 isolates, alleles of the phoQ (PA1180), parS (PA1799), and pmrB (PA4777) sensor kinase genes were sequenced. In Center J, 13 isolates derived from 10 patients shared a single distinct pmrB double mutation (all 13 isolates were WT at the phoQ and parS loci). MLST genotyping of these isolates performed through analysis of aroE (PA0025), trpE (PA0609), acsA (PA0887), ppsA (PA1770), and mutL (PA4946) confirmed that these 13 isolates represented a single clone shared among the patients. Additional shared strains with different phoQ, parS, and pmrB mutations were observed in all three centers generally involving pairs of patients. While the molecular epidemiology suggests the occurrence of patient-to-patient transmission of CRPA strains within these centers, in the absence of contact tracing other possible modes of transmission such as spread from a non-CF point source cannot be excluded. Moreover, sharing of clonal CRPA isolates between patients at different centers has not yet been observed.

18971,MAYBE,Shamaei2009a,Article,"OBJECTIVE: Resistance to anti-tuberculosis (anti-TB) drugs is becoming a major and alarming threat in most regions worldwide. METHODS: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study at a tertiary hospital in Iran, using patient medical records for 2000-2003. The findings were analyzed following the same framework as that used for previous reports from this center. RESULTS: Among 1556 TB patients, drug susceptibility testing (DST) was performed for 548 culture-positive cases. Anti-TB drug resistance to both isoniazid and rifampin was identified in 10 (2.8{\%}) of the new TB cases (multidrug-resistant TB; MDR-TB). Any resistance was detected in 228 (41.6{\%}), showing an increasing trend in both new and retreatment cases. The data analysis revealed that drug-resistant TB had a statistically significant association with Afghan ethnicity, age{\textgreater}65 years, and the type of disease (retreatment vs. new TB case) (p{\textless}0.05). Also, assessment of the drug resistance trends showed a significant increase in resistance to any anti-TB agent, to isoniazid, and to streptomycin in new cases, and to all of the first-line anti-TB drugs in retreatment patients. CONCLUSIONS: There has been an increasing trend in drug resistance in recent years, particularly in retreatment cases.

However, febrile neutropenia remains one of the important limiting factors in these patients especially with the emergence of resistant organisms. Choosing appropriate antimicrobials is possible only if we understand the local microbial spectrum and their sensitivity pattern. Aims: To study the likely etiologic agents and their antibiotic sensitivity pattern among systemic infections in children with cancer. Settings and Design: This is a prospective study. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted at a tertiary care center for pediatrics, in which culture samples representing blood stream infections and others like urinary tract infections sent from the Oncology services of the Hospital during the year of 2013 were analyzed. The microbiological profile and antibiotic sensitivity pattern of these isolates were studied. Results: There were 89 isolates that represented blood and urinary tract infections in neutropenic patients with cancer.Out of 89 positive cultures 76 were gram negative isolates. The most common gram negative bacterial isolates were Escherichia coli 33 (37{\%}), followed by Pseudomonas 21 (23.5{\%}). Acinetobacter grew in 2 patients (2.2{\%}).

19267,YES,Sievert2008,Article,"Background. This report compares the clinical characteristics, epidemiologic investigations, infection-control evaluations, and microbiologic findings of all 7 of the cases of vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA) infection in the United States during the period 2002-2006. Methods. Epidemiologic, clinical, and infection-control information was collected. VRSA isolates underwent confirmatory identification, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and typing of the resistance genes. To assess VRSA transmission, case patients and their contacts were screened for VRSA carriage. Results. Seven cases were identified from 2002 through 2006; 5 were reported from Michigan, 1 was reported from Pennsylvania, and 1 was reported from New York. All VRSA isolates were vanA positive and had a median vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration of 512 $\mu$g/mL. All case patients had a history of prior methicillin-resistant S. aureus and enterococcal infection or colonization; all had several underlying conditions, including chronic skin ulcers; and most had received vancomycin therapy prior to their VRSA infection. Person-to-person transmission of VRSA was not identified beyond any of the case patients. Infection-control precautions were evaluated and were consistent with established guidelines. Conclusions. Seven patients with vanA-positive VRSA have been identified in the United States. Prompt detection by microbiology laboratories and adherence to recommended infection control measures for multidrug-resistant organisms appear to have prevented transmission to other patients. {\textcopyright} 2008 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

Its enterotoxins, LT and ST, including colonization factors mainly are responsible for human pathogenesis. From 239 rectal swabs of diarrheal patients at Hat Yai and Pattani Hospitals during August 2013 and May 2014, five isolates from only a single E. coli sample demonstrated the possession of estA1, encoding porcine heat-stable enterotoxin (STp).

A PCR-based phylogenetic group investigation classified them as members of the virulent E. coli phylogenetic group D. The isolates were resistant to cephalothin, penicillin G, streptomycin, tetracycline and vancomycin.

METHODS: The size and restriction patterns of the plasmids were determined, and antibiotic resistance genes were identified using DNA-DNA hybridization, PCR assays, hybridization of PCR products with internal probes, and sequencing. RESULTS: All CTX-M plasmids were large (58-320 kb) and carried the following genes: aac(6')-Ib (aminoglycoside resistance) which included aac(6')-Ib-cr (aminoglycoside-fluoroquinolone resistance), aadA2 (aminoglycoside resistance), erm(B) (macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B resistance), blaTEM-1 (ampicillin resistance), tet(A) (tetracycline resistance), sul1 (sulphonamide resistance), dfr (trimethoprim resistance) and intI1, an integrase associated with class 1 integrons. Eleven (65{\%}) plasmids carried an mph(A) gene (macrolide resistance), seven (41{\%}) plasmids carried a qnrB1 gene (low-level quinolone resistance) and four (24{\%}) plasmids carried multiple cat genes (chloramphenicol resistance). catA2, catA3 and qnrB1 genes and a 6 kb PstI fragment, carrying the blaCTX-M gene, were sequenced. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first description of catA2 and catA3 genes in Klebsiella spp. and the first description of the erm(B) and floR genes associated with a CTX-M plasmid. This is also the first report of qnrB1 and aac(6')-Ib-cr in isolates from Africa and the first report of these two genes on the same plasmid.",O O Soge and B A Adeniyi and M C Roberts,"0305-7453 (Print)

20356,MAYBE,Tai2013,Article,"Introduction Emergence of carbapenem (CPM) resistant Pa due to metallobeta- lactamase (MBL) associated with class I integrons (int1) poses a health risk to persons with CF. Currently, there are no guidelines for MBL screening and the prevalence of MBL-producing Pa among Australian CF patients is unknown. Aims We sought to: i) compare five MBL phenotypic screening tests, and ii) determine MBL/int1 prevalence among Pa isolates collected from Australian CF patients. Methods Pa isolates collected from 5 Australian adult CF centres were included. 50 randomly selected CPM resistant and 50 matched CPM susceptible isolates were analyzed using the MBL Etest, Double Disc Diffusion test (DDDT), Combined Disc test (CDT), Modified Hodge test (MHT), and antibiogram evaluation. In addition, 509 CPM resistant isolates were screened for int1 and MBL genes by real-time PCR. Results Etest, MHT and stringent antibiogram criteria correctly identified MBL in 2 (Non-CF) Pa reference strains but variable specificity (20{\%}; 86{\%}; 88{\%}, respectively) was observed when applied to CF Pa isolates. Stringent antibiogram has the best positive predictive value (25{\%}). Molecular screening of the 509 isolates (173 patients) revealed that 22 isolates (4.3{\%}) harboured the int1 gene. Interestingly, the AUST-02 strain was associated with higher prevalence of int1 (OR: 2.8; p = 0.04). No MBL-producing isolates were identified. Conclusions In isolates collected in 2007, no MBL Pa isolates were identified.

First identified from air samples in South Korea, it has never been associated with any clinical infections. We described here the first human infection secondary to X. aerolatus in a four-year-old boy with catheter-related peritonitis and the characterization of this organism. Methods: Peritoneal fluid was inoculated directly onto a combination of agar plates. The bacterial isolate (NML100527) was further characterized by conventional biochemicals, gas chromatography and 16S rRNA sequencing. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by broth microdilution. Results: A patient with end-stage renal failure, on CAPD, presented with acute abdominal pain and fever one day after returning from a 10-day trip to Hawaii and Connecticut. 4 of 4 peritoneal fluid cultures were positive for X. aerolatus over a 20-day period. Pinpoint yellow colonies were isolated from Columbia sheep blood and chocolate agar incubated at 35oC in CO2 after 2 days. There was no growth anaerobically. The isolate was motile, Gram-negative and appeared coccobacillary to short rods in shape. It was oxidase and catalase positive, but nitrate, gelatin, cetramide, esculin, and triple decarboxylases negative. It was asaccharolytic and hydrolyzed xanthine, hypoxanthine, and tyrosine. 16S rRNA sequencing showed 100{\%} homology with the type strain X. aerolatus 5526S-2T. Cellular fatty acids by GLC were consistent with published results. It appeared susceptible to aminoglycosides, quinolones, carbapenems, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, but resistant to aztreonam and pipercillin.

20777,MAYBE,Thomas2013a,Article,"OXA-48 $\beta$-lactamase is one of the several emerging carbapenemases. Pre-2007 reports were almost exclusively from Turkey, but subsequently its distribution has expanded. We report an early and prolonged outbreak in the UK of Klebsiella pneumoniae producing OXA-48 carbapenemase affecting a predominantly renal cohort in a West London hospital. Carbapenemase production was detected by the modified Hodge test, with confirmation by PCR for bla OXA-48. Isolates were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Risk factors for acquisition were determined. Between January 2008 and April 2010, 20 K. pneumoniae isolates with reduced susceptibility to carbapenems were identified from 13 patients, comprising 12 renal cases and 1 oncology patient; 8 were outpatients and 5 were inpatients; 7 were deemed to be colonised and 6 infected, including 2 with bacteraemia, 1 of whom died. Hodge tests were positive for all isolates and all had blaOXA-48. PFGE showed strain similarity in isolates from nine patients, whereas four patients' isolates were distinct, representing three further PFGE profiles and suggesting horizontal spread of blaOXA-48.

20788,YES,Thomas2011b,Article,"Objective: To identify the resistance mechanism and determine appropriate antibiotic treatment for a patient whose blood and abdominal fluid isolated an E. coli resistant to ertapenem and the cephalosporins, with borderline imipenem and meropenem resistance. To highlight problems with detection and difficulties with treatment of multi drug resistant Gram negative organisms. Methods: Following hospitalisation for an MI in Egypt, requiring ITU care in The Nile Hospital, the patient was repatriated via air-ambulance to Wythenshawe Hospital for cardiac rehabilitation and subsequently developed an acute abdomen secondary to cholycystitis. Laporotomy and cholecystectomy were carried out and cultures from blood and drain fluid isolated a resistant E. coli. Routine in-house antibiotic susceptibility testing of the isolates was undertaken by VITEK. Resistance was confirmed by the Reference Laboratory who carried out MICs to cephalosporins, carbapenems, aminoglycosides, tigecycline and other agents by agar dilution. Potential carbapenemase activity was examined by a plate assay (Clover Leaf test), followed by enzyme identification by PCR. Results: A pure growth of E. coli with reduced carbapenem susceptibility was isolated. MICs of carbapenems were ertapenem = 8, meropenem = 1 and imipenem = 2. The isolate was clover leaf positive for carbapenemase activity and PCR identified an OXA48. The isolate was pan-$\beta$-lactam-resistant due to a CTX-M, seen by the MIC of Cefotaxime potentiated from {\textgreater}256 to 1, whilst ceftazidime fell from 32 to 1. The isolate was sensitive to tigecycline, which the patient received for 10 days resulting in full recovery. A detailed travel history revealed visits to Tunisia, Spain and Portugal but no travel to Greece or Turkey, during the past 5 yrs. Conclusion: OXA48 has not previously been identified in an E. coli in the UK. Detection of this carbapenemase is problematic as resistance to ertapenem may be the only indicator, yet the MIC of ertapenem can be readily raised by impermeability alone, making its use as a single maker uncertain. Dissemination of OXA48 has to date, been geographically and species restricted and not previously associated with E. coli or with travel to Egypt.

Recently, clarithromycin resistant H. pylori strains represent the main cause of treatment failure. Therefore this study aimed to determine the prevalence and pattern of H. pylori resistance to clarithromycin in Suranaree University of Technology Hospital, Suranree University of Technology, Nakhon Ratchasima, Northeastern Thailand, Nakhon Ratchasima province, northeast of Thailand. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This hospital-based cross-sectional study was carried out between June 2014 and February 2015 with 300 infected patients interviewed and from whom gastric mucosa specimens were collected and proven positive by histology. The gastric mucosa specimens were tested for H. pylori and clarithromycin resistance by 23S ribosomal RNA point mutations analysis using real-time polymerase chain reactions. Correlation of eradication rates with patterns of mutation were analyzed by chi-square test. RESULTS: Of 300 infected patients, the majority were aged between 47-61 years (31.6{\%}), female (52.3{\%}), with monthly income between 10,000-15,000 Baht (57{\%}), and had a history of alcohol drinking (59.3{\%}). Patient symptoms were abdominal pain (48.6{\%}), followed by iron deficiency anemia (35.3{\%}). Papaya salad consumption (40.3{\%}) was a possible risk factor for H. pylori infection. The prevalence of H. pylori strains resistant to clarithromycin was 76.2{\%}. Among clarithromycin-resistant strains tested, all were due to the A2144G point mutation in the 23S rRNA gene. Among mutations group, wild type genotype, mutant strain mixed wild type and mutant genotype were 23.8{\%}, 35.7{\%} and 40.5{\%} respectively. With the clarithromycin-based triple therapy regimen, the efficacy decreased by 70{\%} for H. pylori eradication (P{\textless}0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Recent results indicate a high rate of H. pylori resistance to clarithromycin. Mixed of wild type and mutant genotype is the most common mutant genotype in Nakhon Ratchasima province, therefore the use of clarithromycin-based triple therapy an not advisable as an empiric first-line regimen for H. pylori eradication in northeast region of Thailand.",T Tongtawee and C Dechsukhum and L Matrakool and S Panpimanmas and R A Loyd and S J Kaewpitoon and N Kaewpitoon,"1513-7368 (Print)

21005,MAYBE,Touchan2013,Article,"Case Report: We describe the first case of septic shock due to urinary tract infection caused by Hafnia alvei in the United States. A 59-year-old woman presented with a five day history of left lower extremity swelling. She had a history of Crohn's disease complicated by small bowel resection and multiple fistula repairs, and recurrent deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. In the emergency department, venous Doppler showed DVT of the LLE and the patient was admitted for anticoagulation therapy. On day 8 of hospitalization, the patient developed tachypnea, hypoxia, tachycardia, and hypotension refractory to fluid resuscitation. The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit as she required vasopressors. Her white blood cell count was 21,800 with a left shift. The patient was started on meropenem and vancomycin empirically, after blood and urine cultures were sent. The patient's urine culture grew H. alvei 9100,000 colonies/ml, resistant to ampicillin and cefazolin but sensitive to ceftriaxone. Blood cultures remained negative. The antibiotics were changed to ceftriaxone. The patient's condition improved after 24 hours. She was weaned off vasopressors. The patient's septic shock was attributed to her urinary tract infection caused by H. alvei. H. alvei is a member of the Enterobacteriaceae family that rarely affects humans. Only 12 cases of infections caused by H. alvei have been reported in the US with only one case of pyelonephritis. Our case is unique, being the first case of H. alvei urinary tract infection leading to septic shock. Hafnia causes a variety of systemic infections, including septicemia and pneumonia. Our patient's presentation was consistent with previous literature that shows higher rates of H. alvei infection in patients with Crohn's disease, previous abdominal surgery and female sex. Hafniae are typically resistant to penicillin and their susceptibility to tetracyclines and cephalosporins is variable. Most reported H. alvei cases are polymicrobial; monomicrobial infections are uncommon.

21027,MAYBE,Toyne2012,Article,"Background/Objectives: Antibiotic resistance in the community, including transfer between bacteria, is a growing concern for clinicians. Acne is commonly treated in general practice, sometimes with antibiotics. The aim of this study is to measure the rate of carriage of antibiotic resistant Propionibacterium acnes 10 years apart in general practice and the relationship of resistance to type of treatment, as well potential effects on other flora. Methods: Patients (N = 215) with acne presenting to Australian Capital Territory and south-eastern New South Wales general practices were swabbed for P. acnes in 1997-1998 and 2007. Clinical details were collected with questionnaires. In 2007 swabs were also taken for Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. GP's diagnostic classification of acne was tested using a set of standard photographs. Results: Resistant P. acnes was isolated from 20 patients (9{\%}) and the proportion that was resistant was the same in 1997-1998 and in 2007. Antibiotic use, particularly topical, was associated with P. acnes resistance. Resistance rates declined with the time elapsed since ceasing antibiotics. Use of retinoids was associated with a decreased chance of growing P. acnes (P = 0.008) but not with decreased resistance. Simultaneous resistance with S. aureus was not detected, but only in 30 patients was S. aureus isolated. Conclusions: P. acnes resistance was similar in 1997-1998 and in 2007.The chance of a patient carrying a resistant strain of P. acnes is significantly greater with recent exposure to antibiotics, and clinicians should limit prescribing where possible. Resistance disappears rapidly after ceasing antibiotics.

21824,YES,Vettoretti2009,Article,"The aim of this study was to describe the molecular epidemiology and the mechanisms of resistance to beta-lactams of emerging extensive-drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (XDRPA) in a tertiary-care university hospital over a three-year period. Analysis included antimicrobial susceptibility profiling and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Resistance mechanisms to beta-lactams were identified: production of naturally occurring and acquired beta-lactamases, overproduction of MexAB-OprM and MexXY efflux systems and loss of porin OprD were assessed. Eighteen patients were colonised or infected with XDRPA which remained susceptible to colistin and, to a lesser extent, to rifampicin. beta-lactam resistance was, in most cases, due to the overproduction of AmpC, overproduction of the MexXY efflux system and loss of porin OprD. One isolate produced the class D extended-spectrum oxacillinase (OXA-ESBL) Oxa-28, but none produced metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) or class A extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL). The XDRPA clustered in eight PFGE patterns and both the acquisition and loss of resistance determinants was observed within a single clone during its spread. The emergence of XDRPA isolates in our university hospital has been characterised by genotypic heterogeneity, variation of mechanisms of resistance to beta-lactams in a single clone and the predominance of chromosomally encoded resistance mechanisms.",L Vettoretti and N Floret and D Hocquet and B Dehecq and P Plesiat and D Talon and X Bertrand,0934-9723,Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,"*beta-Lactam Resistance/genetics,Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology,Cluster Analysis,Communicable Diseases, Emerging/drug therapy/epide,Cross Infection/*drug therapy/epidemiology/microbi,Dose-Response Relationship, Drug,Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial,Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field,France/epidemiology,Genotype,Hospitals, University,Humans,Microbial Sensitivity Tests,Molecular Epidemiology,Pseudomonas Infections/*drug therapy/epidemiology/,Pseudomonas aeruginosa/*drug effects/enzymology/ge,Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction",1217--1222,{Emergence of extensive-drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a French university hospital},NA,28,2009,10,"1435-4373

We thus conducted this prospective study to analyze the molecular epidemiology of K. pneumoniae isolates from patients being treated in the 306 Hospital in Beijing, China for the period of November 1, 2010-October 31, 2011. Methodology/Principal Findings: Antibiotic susceptibility testing, PCR amplification and sequencing of the drug resistance-associated genes, and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) were conducted. A total of 163 isolates were analyzed. The percentage of MDR, XDR and PDR isolates were 63.8{\%} (104), 20.9 (34), and 1.8{\%} (3), respectively. MLST results showed that 60 sequence types (STs) were identified, which were further separated by eBURST into 13 clonal complexes and 18 singletons. The most dominant ST was ST15 (10.4{\%}). Seven new alleles and 24 new STs were first identified in this study. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that certain clinical characteristics were associated with those prevalent STs such as: from ICU, from medical ward, from community acquired infection, from patients without heart disease, from patients with treatment success, susceptible to extended spectrum cephalosporin, susceptible to cephamycins, susceptible to fluoroquinolones, and with MDR. Conclusions/Significance: Our data indicate that certain drug-resistant K. pneumoniae clones are highly prevalent and are associated with certain clinical characteristics in hospital settings. Our study provides evidence demonstrating that intensive nosocomial infection control measures are urgently needed. {\textcopyright} 2013 Wang et al.",Q Wang and B Li and A K L Tsang and Y Yi and P C Y Woo and C H Liu,1932-6203,PLoS ONE,",*Cross Infection,*Genetic Variation,*Genotype,80 and over,Adolescent,Adult,Aged,Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology,Bacterial,Bacterial/*genetics,Child,China,Drug Resistance,Essential,Female,Genes,Genetic,Humans,Infant,Klebsiella Infections/diagnosis/epidemiology/*micr,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Klebsiella pneumoniae/classification/drug effects/,Male,Middle Aged,Multilocus Sequence Typing,Phylogeny,Preschool,Selection,Young Adult,adolescent,adult,aged,aminoglycoside antibiotic agent,antibiotic resistance,article,bacterial virulence,bacterium isolate,beta lactamase CTX M,beta lactamase SHV,beta lactamase TEM,cephalosporin,cephamycin derivative,child,clonal variation,controlled study,extensively drug resistance,female,gene cluster,gene frequency,gene linkage disequilibrium,gene locus,gene sequence,genetic analysis,genetic variability,hospital infection,hospital patient,human,hydrolase,infant,intensive care unit,major clinical study,male,molecular epidemiology,multidrug resistance,nonhuman,pandrug resistance,phylogeny,polymerase chain reaction,population genetic structure,prevalence,quinoline derived antiinfective agent,sputum analysis,tertiary health care,unclassified drug,ward",e57091,{Genotypic Analysis of Klebsiella pneumoniae Isolates in a Beijing Hospital Reveals High Genetic Diversity and Clonal Population Structure of Drug-Resistant Isolates},http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord{\&}from=export{\&}id=L368409460 http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0057091 http://rd8hp6du2b.search.serialssolutions.com?sid=EMBASE{\&}issn=19326203{\&}id=doi:10.1371{\%}2Fjournal.pone.0057091{\&}atitle=Genotypi,8,2013,2,"From Duplicate 2 (Genotypic analysis of Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates in a Beijing Hospital reveals high genetic diversity and clonal population structure of drug-resistant isolates - Wang, Q; Li, B; Tsang, A K; Yi, Y; Woo, P C; Liu, C H)

22306,MAYBE,Webster2011,Article,"OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were: (i) to describe an outbreak of multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae in our population; (ii) to identify the potential source of this outbreak by examining antibiotic resistance trends in urocultures; (iii) to evaluate the contribution of this outbreak to resistance patterns over time in the two commonest Gram-negative blood culture isolates, namely K. pneumoniae and Escherichia coli; and (iv) to assess risk factors for multidrug resistance and the impact of this resistance on mortality and length of stay. METHODS: We searched Microbiology and Patient Administration Service databases retrospectively and describe resistance trends in E. coli and K. pneumoniae bloodstream infections (BSIs) in Oxfordshire, UK, over an 11 year period. RESULTS: An outbreak of a multidrug-resistant, CTX-M-15 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing K. pneumoniae clone was identified and shown by multilocus sequence typing to belong to a novel sequence type designated ST490. This was associated with a sporadic change in resistance rates in K. pneumoniae BSIs with rates of multidrug resistance (defined as resistance to three or more antibiotic classes) reaching 40{\%}. A case-control study showed prior antibiotic exposure as a risk factor for infection with this organism. During the same time period, rates of ESBL-producing Klebsiella spp. isolated from urocultures increased from 0.5{\%} to almost 6{\%}. By contrast, the rate of multidrug resistance in E. coli rose more steadily from 0{\%} in 2000 to 10{\%} in 2010. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in resistance rates may be associated with outbreaks of resistant clones in K. pneumoniae. Changing resistance patterns may affect important health economic issues such as length of stay.",D P Webster and B C Young and R Morton and D Collyer and B Batchelor and J F Turton and S Maharjan and D M Livermore and P Bejon and B D Cookson and I C J W Bowler,"0305-7453

In total, 40 (64.5{\%}) of 62 S. Typhimurium isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin (minimum inhibitory concentration {\textgreater}/=0.5 mug/mL), comprising 28 isolates with low-level resistance and 12 isolates with high-level resistance.

23213,MAYBE,Yuan2011,Article,"BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) is a public health concern globally, and azithromycin-resistant NG isolates have been identified in many countries. This study aimed to investigate azithromycin susceptibility in NG and to genetically characterize the azithromycin-resistant isolates identified in 2 cities in China. METHODS: NG isolates (n = 318) were cultured from patients attending 2 sexually transmitted infection clinics in Nanjing and Chongqing, China, between 2008 and 2009. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of azithromycin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, spectinomycin and ceftriaxone was determined using the agar dilution method. NG strains ATCC 49226 and WHO G, J, L, and P were used for quality control. Azithromycin-resistant isolates were defined as having an MIC value equal to or greater than that of strain WHO P, which is internationally recognized as azithromycin-resistant (MIC = 2 mg/L), and genotyped using NG multiantigen sequence typing. RESULTS: The MIC values of strain WHO P for azithromycin were 2 to 4 mg/L in all runs, which showed that the method provided consistent and reliable MIC values. Seventeen isolates (5.3{\%}) showed resistance to azithromycin. Among these isolates (n = 17), 11 sequence types (STs) were identified by NG multiantigen sequence typing, of which 5 were novel. The most common ST was ST3356, represented by 6 isolates. ST1866 was represented by 2 isolates, which were isolated from patients with an unknown relationship, and both isolates were highly resistant to azithromycin, i.e., displayed an MIC of {\textgreater}64 mg/L.

To explore drug resistance determinants of this strain, the draft genome sequence of WJ66 was determined and compared to other S. maltophilia sequences. Genome sequencing and genome-wide evolutionary analysis revealed that WJ66 was highly homologous with the strain K279a, but strain WJ66 contained additional antibiotic resistance genes. Further analysis confirmed that strain WJ66 contained an amino acid substitution (Q83L) in fluoroquinolone target GyrA and carried a class 1 integron, with an aadA2 gene in the resistance gene cassette.

Twenty-two non-duplicate CRKP strains were collected from pediatric patients between March and June in 2014. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted by the agar dilution method. Beta-lactamases were characterized by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing. The transferability of blaNDM-1 was investigated by conjugation experiment. The plasmids bearing antibiotic resistance genes were characterized by S1 nuclease pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (S1-PFGE) and Southern hybridization. Clonal relatedness was evaluated by PFGE and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). The clinical data of patients were retrospectively reviewed. The 22 CRKP strains were resistant to most of the antimicrobial agents tested, except tigecycline and colistin. Overall, 59, 77, and 100 {\%} of these strains were resistant to imipenem, meropenem, and ertapenem, respectively. The blaNDM-1 was positive in 77.3 {\%} (17/22) of the CRKP strains, of which the 16 isolates from inpatients were designated as ST37 (n = 9) and ST76 (n =7) and one isolate from an outpatient belonged to ST846. The 17 blaNDM-1-positive isolates belonged to PFGE type A (n = 9), type C (n = 7), or type B (n = 1). The plasmids bearing blaNDM-1 could be transferred into recipient Escherichia coli J53 through conjugation in 88.2 {\%} (15/17) of the strains.

23761,MAYBE,NA:88,Article,"On January 27, 2011, a West Virginia county health department was notified of a cluster of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) cases detected by a local hospital (hospital A). CRKP infections frequently are resistant to a majority of antimicrobial agents and have an increased risk for morbidity and mortality. The West Virginia Bureau for Public Health (WVBPH) conducted field investigations to identify all cases, characterize risk factors for infection, and abstract data for a matched case-control study. Nineteen case-patients and 38 control patients were identified. Infection with CRKP was associated with admission from or prior stay at a local long-term--care facility (LTCF A). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis indicated that all five hospital A clinical specimens and all 11 point prevalence survey isolates from LTCF A were closely related. This is the first outbreak of CRKP identified in West Virginia. Recommendations to LTCF A included the following: 1) initiate surveillance for multidrug resistant organisms; 2) revise and improve infection prevention and control activities within the facility; 3) educate residents and their families, physicians, and staff members about CRKP; and 4) identify qualified personnel to coordinate infection control functions within the facility. Although LTCF A has made significant improvements, the outbreak investigation is ongoing. Additional site visits have been conducted, and additional colonized residents have been identified; the last clinical case was detected in July. These findings demonstrate the interconnectedness of the health-care system and factors potentially contributing to transmission of infection. Interventions targeting all levels of care are needed to prevent further CRKP transmission.",NA,0149-2195,MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,"*Penicillin Resistance,Aged,Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology,Carbenicillin/*pharmacology,Case-Control Studies,Disease Outbreaks,Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field,Female,Humans,Infection Control,Klebsiella Infections/*drug therapy/*epidemiology,Klebsiella pneumoniae/*drug effects/genetics/isola,Long-Term Care,Male,Population Surveillance,Risk Factors,West Virginia/epidemiology",1418--1420,"{Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae associated with a long-term--care facility --- West Virginia, 2009-2011}",NA,60,2011,41,"1545-861x
